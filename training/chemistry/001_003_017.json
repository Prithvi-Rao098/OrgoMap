    "message_2": "cis-1,3-cyclohexanediol is a cyclic compound with two hydroxyl groups (-OH) attached to carbons 1 and 3 of the cyclohexane ring. \n\nA chiral center (also known as a stereocenter) is a carbon atom that is bonded to four different groups. In cis-1,3-cyclohexanediol, both carbons 1 and 3 are bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, and two different carbon atoms from the cyclohexane ring. Therefore, there are two chiral centers in cis-1,3-cyclohexanediol.\n\nSince cis-1,3-cyclohexanediol has chiral centers, it can exist in different stereoisomeric forms (enantiomers). Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other and can rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions. A compound is considered optically active if it can rotate plane-polarized light.\n\nAs cis-1,3-cyclohexanediol has chiral centers and can exist in enantiomeric forms, it is considered optically active."
