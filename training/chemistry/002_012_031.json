    "message_2": "To calculate the bond order and bond length of the nitrogen-oxygen bond in the nitrate ion (NO3-), we first need to determine the resonance structures and then calculate the average bond order.\n\nResonance structures of NO3- ion:\n\n1. O=N-O(-)-O(-)\n2. O(-)-N=O-O(-)\n3. O(-)-O(-)-N=O\n\nThere are three resonance structures for the nitrate ion, and each nitrogen-oxygen bond is a combination of a single bond and a double bond. \n\nTo calculate the average bond order, we can use the following formula:\n\nBond order = (Total number of bonds in all resonance structures) / (Total number of resonance structures * Total number of bonds in one resonance structure)\n\nIn the nitrate ion, there are a total of 6 bonds (2 single bonds and 1 double bond in each resonance structure).\n\nBond order = (6) / (3 * 2) = 1\n\nThe average bond order for the nitrogen-oxygen bond in the nitrate ion is 1.\n\nNow, let's calculate the bond length. The bond length of a single bond (N-O) is approximately 1.47 Å, and the bond length of a double bond (N=O) is approximately 1.22 Å. Since the bond order is 1, the nitrogen-oxygen bond in the nitrate ion is a combination of a single bond and a double bond. Therefore, the bond length will be between the single bond and double bond lengths.\n\nWe can estimate the bond length using the following formula:\n\nBond length = (Single bond length + Double bond length) / 2\n\nBond length = (1.47 Å + 1.22 Å) / 2 = 1.345 Å\n\nThe bond length of the nitrogen-oxygen bond in the nitrate ion (NO3-) is approximately 1.345 Å."
