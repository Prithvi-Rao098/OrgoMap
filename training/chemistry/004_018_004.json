After adding excess silver nitrate solution to the sample, the student records the mass of the resulting precipitate to be 2.655 grams. Using mass balance calculations, determine the mass percentage of sodium chloride in the original solution.",
    "message_2": "To determine the mass percentage of sodium chloride (NaCl) in the original solution, we first need to find the moles of the precipitate formed, which is silver chloride (AgCl).\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction between sodium chloride and silver nitrate is:\n\nNaCl(aq) + AgNO₃(aq) → AgCl(s) + NaNO₃(aq)\n\nFrom the equation, we can see that the mole ratio between NaCl and AgCl is 1:1.\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of AgCl formed. The molar mass of AgCl is (107.87 g/mol for Ag) + (35.45 g/mol for Cl) = 143.32 g/mol.\n\nMoles of AgCl = mass of AgCl / molar mass of AgCl\nMoles of AgCl = 2.655 g / 143.32 g/mol = 0.0185 mol\n\nSince the mole ratio between NaCl and AgCl is 1:1, the moles of NaCl in the original solution is also 0.0185 mol.\n\nNow, we can find the mass of NaCl in the original solution. The molar mass of NaCl is (22.99 g/mol for Na) + (35.45 g/mol for Cl) = 58.44 g/mol.\n\nMass of NaCl = moles of NaCl × molar mass of NaCl\nMass of NaCl = 0.0185 mol × 58.44 g/mol = 1.080 g\n\nNow, we can find the mass percentage of NaCl in the original solution. The total mass of the solution is not given, so we will assume that the density of the solution is approximately equal to the density of water (1 g/mL) since the concentration of NaCl is not very high. Therefore, the mass of the 25 mL solution is approximately 25 g.\n\nMass percentage of NaCl = (mass of NaCl / total mass of solution) × 100\nMass percentage of NaCl = (1.080 g / 25 g) × 100 = 4.32%\n\nThe mass percentage of sodium chloride in the original solution is approximately 4.32%."
