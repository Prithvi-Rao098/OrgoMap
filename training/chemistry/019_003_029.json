    "message_2": "To calculate the heat capacity of aluminum, we can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat energy absorbed (in Joules), m is the mass of the substance (in grams), c is the specific heat capacity (in J/g°C), and ΔT is the change in temperature (in °C).\n\nWe are given the mass (m = 25 g), the initial and final temperatures (25°C and 100°C), and the heat energy absorbed (q = 750 J). We need to find the specific heat capacity (c).\n\nFirst, let's find the change in temperature (ΔT):\n\nΔT = T_final - T_initial\nΔT = 100°C - 25°C\nΔT = 75°C\n\nNow, we can rearrange the formula to solve for the specific heat capacity (c):\n\nc = q / (mΔT)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nc = 750 J / (25 g × 75°C)\nc = 750 J / 1875 g°C\nc = 0.4 J/g°C\n\nThe heat capacity of the 25 grams of aluminum is 0.4 J/g°C."
