    "message_2": "To determine the specific functional group present in compound X and its concentration using UV-Vis spectroscopy, you would need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Obtain the UV-Vis spectrum of compound X in the wavelength range of 200-400 nm.\n2. Compare the spectrum of compound X to known spectra of compounds with different functional groups to identify the specific functional group present in compound X. This can be done by looking for characteristic absorption peaks or patterns in the spectrum.\n3. Once the functional group is identified, you can use a known standard of a compound containing the same functional group to create a calibration curve. This is done by preparing a series of standard solutions with different concentrations and measuring their absorbance at the wavelength of maximum absorption (λmax) for the functional group.\n4. Plot the absorbance values of the standard solutions against their concentrations to create a calibration curve. The relationship between absorbance and concentration should follow the Beer-Lambert law: A = εcl, where A is absorbance, ε is the molar absorptivity, c is the concentration, and l is the path length of the cuvette.\n5. Measure the absorbance of compound X at the λmax of the functional group and use the calibration curve to determine its concentration.\n\nWithout the actual UV-Vis spectrum of compound X and a known standard, it is not possible to provide the specific functional group and concentration. However, following these steps should allow you to determine both pieces of information."
