    "message_1": "Calculate the cell potential for a given electrochemical reaction where the half-cell reactions are:\n\n* Fe3+(aq) + e- → Fe2+(aq) E° = 0.77 V\n* Ag+(aq) + e- → Ag(s) E° = 0.80 V\n\nAssume 1.0 M solutions and standard state conditions. Determine whether the reaction is spontaneous or non-spontaneous under standard conditions.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the cell potential, we first need to determine the overall balanced redox reaction. We can do this by combining the two half-cell reactions:\n\nFe3+(aq) + e- → Fe2+(aq) E° = 0.77 V (Reduction)\nAg+(aq) + e- → Ag(s) E° = 0.80 V (Reduction)\n\nTo combine these reactions, we need to reverse one of them so that we have one reduction and one oxidation reaction. We will reverse the Fe3+/Fe2+ reaction because it has a lower reduction potential:\n\nFe2+(aq) → Fe3+(aq) + e- E° = -0.77 V (Oxidation)\nAg+(aq) + e- → Ag(s) E° = 0.80 V (Reduction)\n\nNow, we can add the two half-cell reactions together to get the overall balanced redox reaction:\n\nFe2+(aq) + Ag+(aq) → Fe3+(aq) + Ag(s)\n\nNext, we can calculate the cell potential (E°cell) by adding the standard reduction potentials of the two half-cell reactions:\n\nE°cell = E°(reduction) + E°(oxidation)\nE°cell = 0.80 V + (-0.77 V)\nE°cell = 0.03 V\n\nSince the cell potential is positive (0.03 V), the reaction is spontaneous under standard conditions."
