    "message_2": "To determine the concentration of copper ions in a copper sulfate solution using an electrochemical cell and a standard hydrogen electrode (SHE), follow these steps:\n\n1. Prepare the electrochemical cell:\n   a. Set up a half-cell containing the copper sulfate solution with a copper electrode (Cu) immersed in it.\n   b. Set up another half-cell containing a standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) with a platinum electrode (Pt) immersed in a 1.0 M HCl solution.\n   c. Connect the two half-cells with a salt bridge to allow the flow of ions between them.\n   d. Connect the copper electrode and the platinum electrode to a voltmeter to measure the cell potential.\n\n2. Measure the cell voltage:\n   a. Turn on the voltmeter and record the cell potential (E_cell) in volts.\n\n3. Calculate the standard reduction potentials:\n   a. The standard reduction potential for the SHE is 0 V by definition.\n   b. The standard reduction potential for the Cu2+/Cu half-cell is +0.34 V.\n\n4. Calculate the cell potential using the Nernst equation:\n   a. The Nernst equation is E_cell = E°_cell - (RT/nF) * ln(Q), where E°_cell is the standard cell potential, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin (assume 298 K if not given), n is the number of electrons transferred in the redox reaction (2 for Cu2+/Cu), F is the Faraday constant (96485 C/mol), and Q is the reaction quotient.\n   b. Calculate E°_cell by subtracting the standard reduction potential of the SHE from that of the Cu2+/Cu half-cell: E°_cell = 0.34 V - 0 V = 0.34 V.\n   c. Rearrange the Nernst equation to solve for Q: Q = exp((E°_cell - E_cell) * nF / RT).\n   d. Plug in the values and calculate Q.\n\n5. Determine the concentration of Cu2+ ions:\n   a. The reaction quotient Q = [Cu2+] / [H+]^2, where [Cu2+] is the concentration of copper ions and [H+] is the concentration of hydrogen ions (1.0 M in the SHE half-cell).\n   b. Rearrange the equation to solve for [Cu2+]: [Cu2+] = Q * [H+]^2.\n   c. Plug in the values and calculate the concentration of Cu2+ ions in the copper sulfate solution.\n\nBy following these steps, you can determine the concentration of copper ions in a copper sulfate solution using an electrochemical cell and a standard hydrogen electrode."
