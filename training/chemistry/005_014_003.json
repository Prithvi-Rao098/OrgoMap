    "message_2": "In one round of glycolysis, the net gain of ATP is 2 ATP molecules. During glycolysis, one glucose molecule (6 carbons) is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate (3 carbons each). The process involves the following ATP transactions:\n\n1. Two ATP molecules are consumed in the initial steps (phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate and conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate).\n2. Four ATP molecules are produced in the later steps (two ATP molecules per each glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate converted to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, and then to 3-phosphoglycerate).\n\nThe net gain is calculated as the difference between the produced and consumed ATP molecules: 4 ATP produced - 2 ATP consumed = 2 ATP net gain."
