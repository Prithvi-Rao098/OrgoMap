C2H2(g) + 2.5 O2(g) → 2 CO2(g) + H2O(l)    ∆H° = -1299 kJ\n2. 2 CO(g) + O2(g) → 2 CO2(g)                    ∆H° = -566.0 kJ\n3. C2H2(g) + H2(g) → C2H4(g)                       ∆H° = 136.4 kJ\n\nUse Hess's Law to determine the standard enthalpy change for the following reaction: \n\nC2H4(g) + 3 O2(g) → 2 CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l)",
    "message_2": "To determine the standard enthalpy change for the target reaction using Hess's Law, we need to manipulate the given reactions in such a way that when they are added together, they result in the target reaction. \n\nTarget reaction: C2H4(g) + 3 O2(g) → 2 CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l)\n\nFirst, let's reverse reaction 3 to get C2H4(g) on the reactant side:\n\n3'. C2H4(g) → C2H2(g) + H2(g)    ∆H° = -136.4 kJ (the sign changes when reversing the reaction)\n\nNow, we need to manipulate reaction 1 to get 2 H2O(l) on the product side. We can do this by multiplying reaction 1 by 2:\n\n1'. 2 C2H2(g) + 5 O2(g) → 4 CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l)    ∆H° = -2598 kJ (multiply the enthalpy by 2)\n\nFinally, we need to manipulate reaction 2 to cancel out the CO(g) and get the correct amount of CO2(g). We can do this by multiplying reaction 2 by 2:\n\n2'. 4 CO(g) + 2 O2(g) → 4 CO2(g)    ∆H° = -1132 kJ (multiply the enthalpy by 2)\n\nNow, we can add reactions 3', 1', and 2' together:\n\n3'. C2H4(g) → C2H2(g) + H2(g)    ∆H° = -136.4 kJ\n1'. 2 C2H2(g) + 5 O2(g) → 4 CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l)    ∆H° = -2598 kJ\n2'. 4 CO(g) + 2 O2(g) → 4 CO2(g)    ∆H° = -1132 kJ\n--------------------------------------------------\nC2H4(g) + 3 O2(g) → 2 CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l)\n\nNow, add the enthalpy changes for the manipulated reactions:\n\n∆H° = -136.4 kJ + (-2598 kJ) + (-1132 kJ) = -3866.4 kJ\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change for the target reaction is -3866.4 kJ."
