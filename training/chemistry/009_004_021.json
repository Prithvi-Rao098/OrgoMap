    "message_2": "To find the amount of energy released in the nuclear fusion reaction, we can use the following formula:\n\nEnergy released = (mass of hydrogen converted) × (energy equivalent per gram) × (efficiency of the reaction)\n\nGiven:\nMass of hydrogen converted = 5 grams\nEnergy equivalent per gram = 9 x 10^13 joules\nEfficiency of the reaction = 0.7\n\nEnergy released = (5 grams) × (9 x 10^13 joules/gram) × (0.7)\n\nEnergy released = 5 × 9 x 10^13 × 0.7 joules\n\nEnergy released = 31.5 x 10^13 joules\n\nEnergy released = 3.15 x 10^14 joules\n\nSo, the amount of energy released in the nuclear fusion reaction is 3.15 x 10^14 joules."
