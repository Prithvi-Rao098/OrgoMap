    "message_2": "To use Hess's Law, we need to manipulate the given equations in such a way that when they are added together, they result in the target equation: N2(g) + 3H2(g) → 2NH3(g). \n\nFirst, let's look at the second and third equations. We need to reverse them so that N and H atoms are on the product side:\n\n1. 2N(g) → N2(g)                ∆H = -941 kJ/mol\n2. 2H(g) → H2(g)                ∆H = -436 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we need to multiply the second equation by 3 to account for the 3 moles of hydrogen gas in the target equation:\n\n2H(g) → H2(g)                ∆H = -436 kJ/mol\nx 3\n6H(g) → 3H2(g)              ∆H = -1308 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can add the first and modified second and third equations together:\n\n1. 2N(g) → N2(g)                ∆H = -941 kJ/mol\n2. 6H(g) → 3H2(g)              ∆H = -1308 kJ/mol\n----------------------------------------------\n   2N(g) + 6H(g) → N2(g) + 3H2(g)  ∆H = -2249 kJ/mol\n\nFinally, we can use the target equation's enthalpy change to find the enthalpy change for the formation of ammonia:\n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) → 2NH3(g)   ∆H = -92.4 kJ/mol\n\n2N(g) + 6H(g) → N2(g) + 3H2(g)  ∆H = -2249 kJ/mol\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) → 2NH3(g)   ∆H = -92.4 kJ/mol\n------------------------------------------------\n2N(g) + 6H(g) → 2NH3(g)    ∆H = -2156.6 kJ/mol\n\nSince the target equation has 2 moles of NH3, we need to divide the enthalpy change by 2 to find the enthalpy change for the formation of 1 mole of ammonia:\n\n∆H = -2156.6 kJ/mol ÷ 2 = -1078.3 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change for the formation of ammonia gas from nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas is -1078.3 kJ/mol."
