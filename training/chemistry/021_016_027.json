    "message_2": "To find the electronegativity difference between sulfur and fluorine atoms in an SF6 molecule, we need to know the electronegativity values of both elements.\n\nThe electronegativity of sulfur (S) is approximately 2.58, while the electronegativity of fluorine (F) is approximately 3.98.\n\nNow, we can calculate the electronegativity difference:\n\nElectronegativity difference = Electronegativity of fluorine - Electronegativity of sulfur\nElectronegativity difference = 3.98 - 2.58\nElectronegativity difference â‰ˆ 1.40\n\nSo, the electronegativity difference between sulfur and fluorine atoms in an SF6 molecule is approximately 1.40."
