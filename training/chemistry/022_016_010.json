    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of 1 mole of methane gas (CH4) at standard conditions, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the combustion reaction:\n\nCH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l)\n\nNow, we can use Hess's Law to calculate the enthalpy change for this reaction. Hess's Law states that the enthalpy change for a reaction is equal to the sum of the enthalpy changes for the formation of the products minus the sum of the enthalpy changes for the formation of the reactants.\n\nΔH_combustion = [ΔHf(CO2) + 2 * ΔHf(H2O)] - [ΔHf(CH4) + 2 * ΔHf(O2)]\n\nSince O2 is an element in its standard state, its enthalpy of formation is zero. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\nΔH_combustion = [ΔHf(CO2) + 2 * ΔHf(H2O)] - [ΔHf(CH4)]\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nΔH_combustion = [(-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 * (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [(-74.8 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH_combustion = (-393.5 - 571.6 + 74.8) kJ/mol\n\nΔH_combustion = -890.3 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the enthalpy change for the combustion of 1 mole of methane gas (CH4) at standard conditions is -890.3 kJ/mol."
