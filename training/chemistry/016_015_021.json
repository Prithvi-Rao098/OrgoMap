    "message_2": "First, we need to determine the number of moles of the substance. We can do this by dividing the mass of the substance by its molar mass:\n\nmoles = mass / molar mass\nmoles = 100 g / 120 g/mol\nmoles = 0.833 mol\n\nNow, we know that the substance released 5490 J of heat when it dissolved in water and cooled from 60째C to 20째C. To find the heat of crystallization per mole, we need to divide the total heat released by the number of moles:\n\nheat of crystallization = heat released / moles\nheat of crystallization = 5490 J / 0.833 mol\nheat of crystallization = 6590 J/mol\n\nFinally, we need to convert the heat of crystallization from J/mol to kJ/mol:\n\nheat of crystallization = 6590 J/mol * (1 kJ / 1000 J)\nheat of crystallization = 6.59 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the heat of crystallization of the substance is 6.59 kJ/mol."
