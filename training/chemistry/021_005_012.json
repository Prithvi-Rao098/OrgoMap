    "message_2": "The C-H bond in methane (CH4) is considered to be nonpolar. This is because the electronegativity difference between carbon (2.55) and hydrogen (2.20) is relatively small (0.35). As a result, the electrons in the bond are shared fairly equally between the two atoms, and there is no significant charge separation or dipole moment. Additionally, methane has a tetrahedral molecular geometry, which means that the bond dipoles cancel each other out, resulting in a nonpolar molecule overall."
