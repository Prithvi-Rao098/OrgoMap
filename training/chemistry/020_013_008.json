    "message_1": "What is the equilibrium constant, Kc, at 25°C for the dissociation of acetic acid (CH3COOH) in water given that the initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.10 M, and the equilibrium concentration of H+ ions is 7.5 x 10^-5 M?",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant, Kc, for the dissociation of acetic acid in water, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nCH3COOH (aq) ⇌ CH3COO- (aq) + H+ (aq)\n\nNow, we can use the given information to find the equilibrium concentrations of all species involved in the reaction. We are given the initial concentration of acetic acid (0.10 M) and the equilibrium concentration of H+ ions (7.5 x 10^-5 M). Since the reaction is 1:1, the equilibrium concentration of CH3COO- ions will also be 7.5 x 10^-5 M.\n\nThe change in the concentration of acetic acid will be equal to the concentration of H+ ions formed, so the equilibrium concentration of CH3COOH will be:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.10 M - 7.5 x 10^-5 M ≈ 0.10 M\n\nNow we can use the equilibrium concentrations to find the equilibrium constant, Kc:\n\nKc = [CH3COO-][H+] / [CH3COOH]\n\nKc = (7.5 x 10^-5 M)(7.5 x 10^-5 M) / (0.10 M)\n\nKc ≈ 5.625 x 10^-9\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant, Kc, for the dissociation of acetic acid in water at 25°C is approximately 5.625 x 10^-9."
