    "message_2": "The nucleophilic substitution reaction in which an alkyl halide reacts with ammonia is known as the S_N2 (Substitution Nucleophilic Bimolecular) mechanism. In this reaction, ammonia acts as a nucleophile and attacks the alkyl halide, leading to the formation of an amine product. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the reaction mechanism:\n\nStep 1: Nucleophilic attack\nAmmonia (NH3), which has a lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom, acts as a nucleophile. The nucleophile attacks the electrophilic carbon atom of the alkyl halide (R-X, where R is an alkyl group and X is a halogen). The electrophilic carbon is partially positive due to the electronegativity difference between carbon and the halogen atom.\n\nStep 2: Transition state formation\nAs the nucleophile attacks the electrophilic carbon, a transition state is formed. In this transition state, the carbon atom is partially bonded to both the halogen atom and the nitrogen atom of ammonia. The bond between the carbon and halogen is being broken, while the bond between the carbon and nitrogen is being formed. The transition state is a high-energy state and is represented by brackets and a double dagger symbol ([R-NH3---X]â€¡).\n\nStep 3: Halogen atom departure\nThe bond between the carbon and halogen atom is fully broken, and the halogen atom departs as a leaving group, taking the bonding electrons with it. This results in the formation of a new bond between the carbon and nitrogen atoms.\n\nStep 4: Product formation\nThe final product is an amine (R-NH2) and a halide ion (X-). The reaction proceeds through the S_N2 mechanism because it involves a direct nucleophilic attack on the electrophilic carbon and a single concerted step.\n\nIllustration using curly arrows:\n\n1. The curly arrow starts from the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom of ammonia and points towards the electrophilic carbon atom of the alkyl halide, indicating the nucleophilic attack.\n\n2. Another curly arrow starts from the bond between the carbon and halogen atoms and points towards the halogen atom, indicating the breaking of the bond and the departure of the halogen as a leaving group.\n\nOverall, the S_N2 mechanism involving ammonia and an alkyl halide results in the formation of an amine and a halide ion. The reaction proceeds through a single concerted step, with a direct nucleophilic attack on the electrophilic carbon and the simultaneous departure of the halogen atom as a leaving group."
