    "message_2": "To determine the oxidation state of sulfur in sodium sulfite (Na2SO3), we will use the oxidation state rules:\n\n1. The oxidation state of an atom in a free element is zero.\n2. The oxidation state of a monatomic ion is equal to its charge.\n3. The sum of the oxidation states of all atoms in a neutral molecule is zero, and in an ion, it is equal to the ion's charge.\n\nIn sodium sulfite (Na2SO3), we have two sodium (Na) atoms, one sulfur (S) atom, and three oxygen (O) atoms. Sodium is an alkali metal, and its oxidation state in compounds is usually +1. Oxygen is a non-metal, and its oxidation state in most compounds is -2.\n\nLet's assign oxidation states to the atoms in Na2SO3:\n\n- Sodium (Na): +1 (each)\n- Oxygen (O): -2 (each)\n- Sulfur (S): x (unknown)\n\nNow, we will apply rule 3. Since sodium sulfite is a neutral molecule, the sum of the oxidation states of all atoms should be zero.\n\n2(+1) + x + 3(-2) = 0\n\nSolve for x:\n\n2 + x - 6 = 0\nx - 4 = 0\nx = 4\n\nSo, the oxidation state of sulfur (S) in sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) is +4."
