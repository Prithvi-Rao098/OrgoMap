    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kp) for the reaction, we can use the expression:\n\nKp = [NH3]^2 / ([N2] * [H2]^3)\n\nwhere [NH3], [N2], and [H2] are the equilibrium partial pressures of NH3, N2, and H2, respectively.\n\nGiven the equilibrium partial pressures:\n[N2] = 0.50 atm\n[H2] = 0.40 atm\n[NH3] = 1.20 atm\n\nPlug these values into the Kp expression:\n\nKp = (1.20)^2 / (0.50 * (0.40)^3)\n\nKp = 1.44 / (0.50 * 0.064)\n\nKp = 1.44 / 0.032\n\nKp ≈ 45\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (Kp) for the reaction at 400°C is approximately 45."
