    "message_2": "N,N-Dimethylbenzylamine is an organic compound with the molecular formula C9H13N. Its IUPAC name is N,N-dimethylbenzenemethanamine. The chemical structure of N,N-Dimethylbenzylamine consists of a benzene ring (C6H5) attached to a methylene group (CH2) and an amine group (N(CH3)2). The amine group has two methyl groups (CH3) attached to the nitrogen atom.\n\nBenzylamine, on the other hand, has the molecular formula C7H9N and its IUPAC name is benzenemethanamine. Its chemical structure consists of a benzene ring (C6H5) attached to a methylene group (CH2) and an amine group (NH2).\n\nThe main difference between the two compounds is the presence of two methyl groups (CH3) attached to the nitrogen atom in N,N-Dimethylbenzylamine, while in Benzylamine, there are two hydrogen atoms (H) attached to the nitrogen atom. This difference in the amine group affects the chemical properties and reactivity of the two compounds."
