    "message_2": "To determine the amount of copper in moles, we need to use Faraday's law of electrolysis. Faraday's law states that the amount of substance (in moles) produced or consumed at an electrode during electrolysis is directly proportional to the amount of electrical charge (in coulombs) passed through the solution.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total charge passed through the solution. The charge (Q) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nQ = I × t\n\nwhere Q is the charge in coulombs, I is the current in amperes, and t is the time in seconds.\n\nGiven the current (I) is 2.50 A and the time (t) is 30 minutes, we need to convert the time to seconds:\n\nt = 30 minutes × 60 seconds/minute = 1800 seconds\n\nNow, we can calculate the charge (Q):\n\nQ = 2.50 A × 1800 s = 4500 C\n\nNext, we need to use Faraday's constant (F) which is the charge of one mole of electrons:\n\nF = 96485 C/mol\n\nNow, we can use Faraday's law to find the moles of copper (n) produced during electrolysis:\n\nn = Q / (z × F)\n\nwhere n is the moles of copper, Q is the charge in coulombs, z is the number of electrons transferred per copper ion (Cu²⁺), and F is Faraday's constant.\n\nCopper ions (Cu²⁺) gain two electrons during electrolysis to form copper metal (Cu):\n\nCu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu\n\nSo, z = 2.\n\nNow, we can calculate the moles of copper (n):\n\nn = 4500 C / (2 × 96485 C/mol) = 0.0233 mol\n\nTherefore, the amount of copper in moles in the 500 mL solution of 0.1 M CuSO₄ when electrolyzed using a current of 2.50 A for 30 minutes is 0.0233 mol."
