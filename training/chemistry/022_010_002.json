What is the mass of silver chloride precipitate that can be formed when 25 mL of 0.1 M silver nitrate solution is added to 50 mL of 0.05 M potassium chloride solution?",
    "message_2": "The balanced chemical equation for the precipitation reaction between potassium chloride (KCl) and silver nitrate (AgNO3) is:\n\nKCl(aq) + AgNO3(aq) → AgCl(s) + KNO3(aq)\n\nTo find the mass of silver chloride (AgCl) precipitate that can be formed, we first need to determine the limiting reactant. We can do this by calculating the moles of each reactant and comparing their mole ratios.\n\nMoles of silver nitrate (AgNO3) = (Volume × Concentration)\nMoles of AgNO3 = (0.025 L)(0.1 mol/L) = 0.0025 mol\n\nMoles of potassium chloride (KCl) = (Volume × Concentration)\nMoles of KCl = (0.05 L)(0.05 mol/L) = 0.0025 mol\n\nThe mole ratio of KCl to AgNO3 in the balanced equation is 1:1. Since both reactants have the same number of moles, neither is the limiting reactant, and the reaction will go to completion.\n\nNow, we can calculate the mass of silver chloride (AgCl) precipitate formed:\n\nMoles of AgCl = Moles of AgNO3 = 0.0025 mol\n\nMolar mass of AgCl = 107.87 g/mol (Ag) + 35.45 g/mol (Cl) = 143.32 g/mol\n\nMass of AgCl = Moles of AgCl × Molar mass of AgCl\nMass of AgCl = (0.0025 mol)(143.32 g/mol) = 0.3583 g\n\nSo, the mass of silver chloride precipitate that can be formed is approximately 0.3583 grams."
