    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change (∆H°) for the given reaction, we need to use the following formula:\n\n∆H° = Σ ∆Hf°(products) - Σ ∆Hf°(reactants)\n\nHere, ∆Hf° refers to the standard enthalpy of formation of each substance involved in the reaction. The standard enthalpy of formation values for the substances involved in the reaction are:\n\nC6H12O6 (s): -1273 kJ/mol\nO2 (g): 0 kJ/mol (since it is an element in its standard state)\nCO2 (g): -393.5 kJ/mol\nH2O (l): -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n∆H° = [6(-393.5) + 6(-285.8)] - [-1273 + 6(0)]\n\n∆H° = [-2361 - 1714.8] - [-1273]\n\n∆H° = -4075.8 + 1273\n\n∆H° = -2802.8 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change for the given reaction is -2802.8 kJ/mol."
