The molar mass of Cu is 63.55 g/mol and the Faraday constant is 96,485 C/mol.\"",
    "message_2": "To find the concentration of Cu2+ ions in the solution, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total charge (Q) passed through the cell.\n2. Calculate the number of moles of Cu2+ ions (n) deposited on the cathode.\n3. Calculate the volume of the solution (V) using the total charge and the concentration of Cu2+ ions.\n4. Calculate the concentration of Cu2+ ions (c) in the solution.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total charge (Q) passed through the cell.\nQ = current (I) × time (t)\nGiven current (I) = 0.2 A and time (t) = 1 hour = 3600 seconds\nQ = 0.2 A × 3600 s = 720 C\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of moles of Cu2+ ions (n) deposited on the cathode.\nn = mass of Cu / molar mass of Cu\nGiven mass of Cu = 3.24 g and molar mass of Cu = 63.55 g/mol\nn = 3.24 g / 63.55 g/mol = 0.051 mol\n\nStep 3: Calculate the number of faradays (F) used to deposit the Cu2+ ions.\nFor Cu2+ ions, the number of electrons involved in the redox reaction is 2. Therefore, the number of faradays required to deposit 1 mole of Cu2+ ions is 2.\nNumber of faradays (F) = n × 2 = 0.051 mol × 2 = 0.102 mol\n\nStep 4: Calculate the volume of the solution (V) using the total charge and the concentration of Cu2+ ions.\nFaraday's law states that the total charge (Q) is equal to the product of the number of faradays (F) and the Faraday constant (F_constant).\nQ = F × F_constant\n720 C = 0.102 mol × F_constant\nF_constant = 720 C / 0.102 mol = 7058.82 C/mol\n\nSince the Faraday constant is given as 96,485 C/mol, we can find the volume of the solution (V) by dividing the calculated Faraday constant (7058.82 C/mol) by the given Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol).\nV = 7058.82 C/mol / 96,485 C/mol = 0.0731 L\n\nStep 5: Calculate the concentration of Cu2+ ions (c) in the solution.\nc = n / V\nc = 0.051 mol / 0.0731 L = 0.697 mol/L\n\nTherefore, the concentration of Cu2+ ions in the solution is 0.697 mol/L."
