    "message_2": "To determine the functional groups present in an unknown organic compound with a molecular formula of C6H12O2 using infrared spectroscopy, we need to analyze the specific absorption bands in the IR spectrum. However, since the IR spectrum is not provided, I can only suggest possible functional groups based on the molecular formula.\n\nC6H12O2 has an index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of 1, which means it has one double bond or one ring. Some possible functional groups that could be present in the compound are:\n\n1. Ester (R-COO-R'): The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an oxygen atom in the molecule suggests that it could be an ester. The IR spectrum would show a strong absorption band around 1730-1750 cm-1 for the carbonyl group and a weaker band around 1000-1300 cm-1 for the C-O bond.\n\n2. Carboxylic acid (R-COOH): Although less likely due to the molecular formula, the compound could also be a carboxylic acid with an additional double bond or ring in the structure. The IR spectrum would show a strong and broad absorption band around 2500-3300 cm-1 for the O-H bond and a strong band around 1700-1720 cm-1 for the carbonyl group.\n\n3. Cyclic ether (R-O-R') and alkene (R-CH=CH-R'): The compound could also be a combination of a cyclic ether and an alkene. The IR spectrum would show a weak absorption band around 1000-1300 cm-1 for the C-O bond in the ether and a band around 1600-1680 cm-1 for the C=C bond in the alkene.\n\nPlease note that without the actual IR spectrum, it is not possible to definitively determine the functional groups present in the compound."
