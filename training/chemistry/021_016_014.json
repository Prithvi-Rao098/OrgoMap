    "message_2": "The electronegativity values for chlorine (Cl) and oxygen (O) are 3.16 and 3.44, respectively. To find the electronegativity difference between these two atoms, subtract the smaller value from the larger value:\n\nElectronegativity difference = 3.44 (O) - 3.16 (Cl) = 0.28\n\nTo determine if the bond formed between these two atoms is covalent or ionic, we can use the following general guidelines:\n\n- If the electronegativity difference is less than 0.5, the bond is considered nonpolar covalent.\n- If the electronegativity difference is between 0.5 and 1.7, the bond is considered polar covalent.\n- If the electronegativity difference is greater than 1.7, the bond is considered ionic.\n\nSince the electronegativity difference between Cl and O is 0.28, the bond formed between these two atoms is considered nonpolar covalent."
