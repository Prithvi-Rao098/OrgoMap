    "message_2": "To find the boiling point of ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) at a pressure of 1 atm, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates the vapor pressure of a substance at different temperatures to its heat of vaporization. The equation is:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, ΔHvap is the heat of vaporization, and R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K).\n\nHowever, we don't have enough information to directly use this equation. We need to know the vapor pressure of NH4Cl at a known temperature (P1 and T1) to find the boiling point (T2) at 1 atm pressure (P2).\n\nAmmonium chloride is a solid at room temperature and decomposes upon heating before reaching its boiling point. It undergoes a process called sublimation, where it directly converts from solid to gas without passing through the liquid phase. Therefore, it doesn't have a boiling point at 1 atm pressure in the traditional sense.\n\nInstead, we can find the temperature at which the vapor pressure of NH4Cl equals 1 atm (101.3 kPa) using the available data. However, without the vapor pressure at a known temperature, we cannot proceed further to find the temperature at which NH4Cl would have a vapor pressure of 1 atm."
