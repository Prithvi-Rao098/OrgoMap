    "message_2": "The nuclear fission of uranium-235 (U-235) can be represented by the following equation:\n\nn + U-235 â†’ X + Y + k neutrons + energy\n\nHere, n represents a neutron, X and Y are the fission products (usually lighter elements like barium, krypton, or strontium), and k is the number of neutrons released during the fission event.\n\nThe exact fission products and the number of neutrons released can vary depending on the specific fission event. On average, the fission of U-235 releases about 2.5 neutrons per event.\n\nThe energy released per fission event for U-235 is approximately 200 MeV (million electron volts), which is equivalent to 3.2 x 10^(-11) Joules. This energy is released in the form of kinetic energy of the fission products and neutrons, as well as gamma radiation and beta particles."
