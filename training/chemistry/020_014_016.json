    "message_1": "What is the percent ionization of a weak acid HA at 25°C, if its ionization constant (Ka) is 2.5 x 10^-5, and its initial concentration is 0.1 M? If the temperature is increased to 45°C, what will be the new percent ionization of the weak acid? (Assuming all other conditions remain constant)",
    "message_2": "To find the percent ionization of the weak acid HA at 25°C, we can use the ionization constant (Ka) and the initial concentration of the acid. The ionization of the weak acid can be represented by the following equilibrium:\n\nHA ⇌ H+ + A-\n\nKa = [H+][A-] / [HA]\n\nSince the initial concentration of HA is 0.1 M, we can assume that the change in concentration due to ionization is small compared to the initial concentration. Let x be the concentration of H+ and A- ions formed due to ionization. Then, the equilibrium concentrations can be represented as:\n\n[H+] = [A-] = x\n[HA] = 0.1 - x\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the Ka expression:\n\n2.5 x 10^-5 = x^2 / (0.1 - x)\n\nSince x is small compared to 0.1, we can approximate (0.1 - x) as 0.1:\n\n2.5 x 10^-5 = x^2 / 0.1\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nx^2 = 2.5 x 10^-5 * 0.1\nx^2 = 2.5 x 10^-6\nx = sqrt(2.5 x 10^-6)\nx ≈ 1.58 x 10^-3\n\nNow, we can calculate the percent ionization:\n\nPercent ionization = (x / 0.1) * 100\nPercent ionization ≈ (1.58 x 10^-3 / 0.1) * 100\nPercent ionization ≈ 1.58%\n\nAt 25°C, the percent ionization of the weak acid HA is approximately 1.58%.\n\nWhen the temperature is increased to 45°C, the ionization constant Ka will also increase due to the increased temperature. However, without knowing the exact relationship between temperature and Ka or the new value of Ka at 45°C, we cannot determine the new percent ionization of the weak acid. In general, though, we can expect the percent ionization to increase as the temperature increases."
