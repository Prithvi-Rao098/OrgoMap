    "message_2": "First, we need to identify the limiting reactant. To do this, we will compare the moles of each reactant to the stoichiometric coefficients in the balanced chemical equation.\n\n1. Calculate the moles of each reactant:\nMoles of H2 = mass (g) / molar mass (g/mol)\nMoles of H2 = 25 g / 2.02 g/mol (molar mass of H2 = 2.02 g/mol)\nMoles of H2 = 12.38 mol\n\n2. Divide the moles of each reactant by their respective stoichiometric coefficients:\nMoles of H2 / stoichiometric coefficient of H2 = 12.38 mol / 3 = 4.13\n\n3. The reactant with the smallest value is the limiting reactant. In this case, H2 is the limiting reactant.\n\n4. Now, use stoichiometry to determine the amount of nitrogen gas that reacts:\nFrom the balanced equation, 1 mol of N2 reacts with 3 mol of H2. So, we can set up a proportion:\n\n1 mol N2 / 3 mol H2 = x mol N2 / 12.38 mol H2\n\n5. Solve for x (moles of N2):\nx = (1 mol N2 / 3 mol H2) * 12.38 mol H2\nx = 4.13 mol N2\n\n6. Convert moles of N2 to grams:\nMass of N2 = moles * molar mass\nMass of N2 = 4.13 mol * 28.02 g/mol (molar mass of N2 = 28.02 g/mol)\nMass of N2 = 115.64 g\n\nTherefore, 115.64 grams of nitrogen gas can react with 25 grams of hydrogen gas to form ammonia."
