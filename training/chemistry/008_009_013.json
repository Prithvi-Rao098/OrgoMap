    "message_2": "To reduce the long-term impact of nuclear waste on the environment, we can focus on developing new methods for disposal and storage. Some potential solutions include:\n\n1. Improved containment materials: Develop advanced materials for waste containment that are more resistant to corrosion, radiation, and extreme temperatures. This could help prevent leaks and breaches in storage facilities, reducing the risk of environmental contamination.\n\n2. Geological repositories: Construct deep geological repositories in stable rock formations to store high-level nuclear waste. These repositories would be designed to isolate the waste from the biosphere for thousands of years, minimizing the risk of groundwater contamination and other environmental impacts.\n\n3. Reprocessing and recycling: Develop advanced reprocessing technologies to separate and recover valuable materials from spent nuclear fuel, such as uranium and plutonium. These materials can then be recycled into new fuel, reducing the volume of waste that needs to be disposed of and extending the life of nuclear fuel resources.\n\n4. Transmutation: Research and develop advanced nuclear reactors capable of transmuting long-lived radioactive isotopes into shorter-lived or stable isotopes. This process could significantly reduce the long-term radiotoxicity of nuclear waste, making it easier and safer to manage.\n\n5. Deep borehole disposal: Investigate the feasibility of disposing of nuclear waste in deep boreholes, which are drilled several kilometers into the Earth's crust. This method could provide a more secure and permanent solution for waste disposal, as the waste would be isolated from the biosphere by multiple layers of rock.\n\n6. Space disposal: Although currently considered too risky and expensive, future advancements in space technology could potentially make it feasible to launch nuclear waste into space, where it would be permanently removed from the Earth's environment.\n\n7. Public education and engagement: Increase public awareness and understanding of nuclear waste management issues, and involve local communities in decision-making processes related to waste disposal and storage. This could help build public trust and support for the development and implementation of new disposal methods.\n\n8. International collaboration: Foster international cooperation and information sharing on nuclear waste management research and best practices. This could help accelerate the development of new technologies and ensure that all countries have access to safe and effective waste disposal solutions.\n\nBy focusing on these strategies, we can work towards reducing the long-term impact of nuclear waste on the environment and ensuring the safe and responsible management of this hazardous material."
