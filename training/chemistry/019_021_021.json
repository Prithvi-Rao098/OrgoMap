Given: ΔHf° (MgO) = -601.8 kJ/mol, ΔHf° (H2O) = -285.8 kJ/mol, and ΔHf° (Mg(OH)2) = -924.6 kJ/mol.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the formula:\n\nΔH°(reaction) = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants)\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\n2 MgO (s) + 3 H2O (g) → 2 Mg(OH)2 (aq)\n\nFirst, we need to determine the total enthalpy of formation for the reactants and products.\n\nReactants:\n2 moles of MgO: 2 × (-601.8 kJ/mol) = -1203.6 kJ\n3 moles of H2O: 3 × (-285.8 kJ/mol) = -857.4 kJ\nTotal enthalpy of reactants: -1203.6 kJ + (-857.4 kJ) = -2061 kJ\n\nProducts:\n2 moles of Mg(OH)2: 2 × (-924.6 kJ/mol) = -1849.2 kJ\nTotal enthalpy of products: -1849.2 kJ\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nΔH°(reaction) = (-1849.2 kJ) - (-2061 kJ) = 211.8 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the reaction is 211.8 kJ."
