    "message_2": "The difference between primary, secondary, and tertiary amines lies in the number of carbon atoms directly attached to the nitrogen atom in their molecular structure. \n\n1. Primary amine: In a primary amine, the nitrogen atom is bonded to one carbon atom and two hydrogen atoms. The general formula for a primary amine is RNH2, where R is an alkyl or aryl group.\n\nExample: Methylamine (CH3NH2)\n\n2. Secondary amine: In a secondary amine, the nitrogen atom is bonded to two carbon atoms and one hydrogen atom. The general formula for a secondary amine is R2NH, where both R groups can be the same or different alkyl or aryl groups.\n\nExample: Dimethylamine [(CH3)2NH]\n\n3. Tertiary amine: In a tertiary amine, the nitrogen atom is bonded to three carbon atoms and has no hydrogen atoms directly attached to it. The general formula for a tertiary amine is R3N, where all three R groups can be the same or different alkyl or aryl groups.\n\nExample: Trimethylamine [(CH3)3N]"
