    "message_2": "When magnesium metal reacts with hydrochloric acid, the products formed are magnesium chloride and hydrogen gas. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nMg (s) + 2 HCl (aq) → MgCl₂ (aq) + H₂ (g)\n\nThis reaction is an example of a single displacement reaction, where magnesium displaces hydrogen from hydrochloric acid to form magnesium chloride and hydrogen gas."
