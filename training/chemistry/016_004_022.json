    "message_2": "To find the heat capacity of the aluminum block, we can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat supplied (100 Joules), m is the mass of the block (50 grams), c is the specific heat capacity of aluminum, and ΔT is the temperature change (10°C).\n\nFirst, we need to find the specific heat capacity of aluminum, which is 0.897 J/g°C.\n\nNow we can rearrange the formula to solve for c:\n\nc = q / (mΔT)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nc = 100 J / (50 g × 10°C)\n\nc = 100 J / 500 g°C\n\nc = 0.2 J/g°C\n\nHowever, this value is not consistent with the known specific heat capacity of aluminum (0.897 J/g°C). There might be an error in the given data or the aluminum block might not be pure. If we assume that the given data is correct, the heat capacity of this particular aluminum block is 0.2 J/g°C."
