    "message_2": "The Lewis structure of carbon dioxide (CO2) is represented as follows:\n\nO = C = O\n\nIn this structure, the central carbon atom is double-bonded to each of the two oxygen atoms. The carbon atom has four valence electrons, while each oxygen atom has six valence electrons. By forming two double bonds, the carbon atom shares a total of four electrons with the oxygen atoms, and each oxygen atom shares two electrons with the carbon atom. This results in a stable structure with full octets for all atoms involved."
