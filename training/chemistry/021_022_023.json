    "message_2": "HClO3, also known as chloric acid, is an oxyacid of chlorine. In general, oxyacids are acidic compounds that contain a central atom (in this case, chlorine) bonded to oxygen atoms and at least one hydrogen atom bonded to an oxygen atom. The acidity of oxyacids is determined by the number of oxygen atoms bonded to the central atom and the electronegativity of the central atom.\n\nIn the case of HClO3, there are three oxygen atoms bonded to the central chlorine atom, and one hydrogen atom bonded to one of the oxygen atoms. The presence of multiple oxygen atoms increases the acidity of the molecule, as they draw electron density away from the central atom, making it easier for the hydrogen atom to be released as a proton (H+). Additionally, chlorine is a highly electronegative element, which further contributes to the acidity of the molecule.\n\nBased on its structure and the relevant chemical principles, HClO3 is predicted to be an acidic compound."
