    "message_2": "To calculate the bond length between a carbon and a hydrogen atom in methane, we can use the following equation:\n\nBond length = sqrt((2 * Bond energy) / (Force constant * Avogadro's number))\n\nFirst, we need to convert the bond energy from kcal/mol to J/mol:\n\n104.2 kcal/mol * 4184 J/kcal = 435888 J/mol\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the equation:\n\nBond length = sqrt((2 * 435888 J/mol) / (500 N/m * 6.022 x 10^23 mol^-1))\n\nBond length = sqrt((871776 J/mol) / (3.011 x 10^23 N))\n\nBond length = sqrt(2.896 x 10^-21 m^2)\n\nBond length ≈ 1.70 x 10^-10 m\n\nSo, the bond length between a carbon and a hydrogen atom in methane is approximately 1.70 x 10^-10 meters or 1.70 Å (angstroms)."
