    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which relates the pH of a solution to the pKa and the ratio of the concentrations of the conjugate base (A-) and the weak acid (HA):\n\npH = pKa + log ([A-]/[HA])\n\nFirst, we need to find the pKa of acetic acid. The pKa is the negative logarithm of the Ka:\n\npKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.8 x 10^-5) ≈ 4.74\n\nNow, we have a 0.1 M solution of both acetic acid (HA) and its corresponding acetate ion (A-). Since the concentrations of the acid and its conjugate base are equal, the ratio [A-]/[HA] is 1:\n\n[A-]/[HA] = [CH3COO-]/[CH3COOH] = 0.1 M / 0.1 M = 1\n\nNow we can plug these values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log ([A-]/[HA]) = 4.74 + log(1) = 4.74 + 0 = 4.74\n\nTherefore, the pH of the 0.1 M solution of acetic acid and its corresponding acetate ion is 4.74."
