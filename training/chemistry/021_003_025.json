    "message_2": "Using the valence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory, the predicted bond angle in the H2O molecule can be determined by considering the electron pairs around the central oxygen atom. In H2O, the oxygen atom has two bonded electron pairs (with the two hydrogen atoms) and two lone electron pairs.\n\nAccording to VSEPR theory, these electron pairs will arrange themselves to minimize repulsion, resulting in a tetrahedral electron pair geometry. However, since we are only considering the bond angle between the two hydrogen atoms, the molecular geometry is bent.\n\nIn a perfect tetrahedral arrangement, the bond angle would be 109.5 degrees. However, due to the greater repulsion of the lone electron pairs compared to the bonded electron pairs, the bond angle between the hydrogen atoms in H2O is slightly compressed. The predicted bond angle in H2O is approximately 104.5 degrees."
