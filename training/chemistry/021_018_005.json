    "message_1": "What is the predicted boiling point of a substance with intermolecular forces that consist of only London dispersion forces? Compare your prediction with the boiling point of a substance that has hydrogen bonding as its primary intermolecular force.",
    "message_2": "The boiling point of a substance depends on the strength of its intermolecular forces. London dispersion forces are the weakest type of intermolecular forces, and they arise from temporary dipoles created by the movement of electrons in molecules. Substances with only London dispersion forces as their intermolecular forces generally have low boiling points.\n\nOn the other hand, hydrogen bonding is a much stronger intermolecular force compared to London dispersion forces. It occurs between molecules containing a hydrogen atom bonded to a highly electronegative atom, such as nitrogen, oxygen, or fluorine. Substances with hydrogen bonding as their primary intermolecular force typically have higher boiling points compared to substances with only London dispersion forces.\n\nTo predict the boiling point of a substance with only London dispersion forces, one would need more information about the substance, such as its molecular weight and structure. In general, however, the boiling point of a substance with only London dispersion forces will be lower than that of a substance with hydrogen bonding as its primary intermolecular force."
