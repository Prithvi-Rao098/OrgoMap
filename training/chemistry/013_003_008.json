    "message_2": "The Langmuir adsorption isotherm equation is given by:\n\nθ = (K * P) / (1 + K * P)\n\nwhere:\nθ represents the fractional coverage of the adsorbent surface (adsorbed molecules per available site),\nK is the Langmuir constant (which depends on the specific gas and solid surface, as well as the temperature),\nP is the partial pressure of the gas.\n\nThe maximum adsorption capacity occurs when the surface is fully covered by the adsorbed gas molecules, which means θ = 1. In this case, the Langmuir equation becomes:\n\n1 = (K * P) / (1 + K * P)\n\nTo find the maximum adsorption capacity, we need to solve for P:\n\n1 + K * P = K * P\n1 = K * P - K * P^2\n1 = K * P(1 - P)\n\nNow, we can solve for P:\n\nP = 1 / K\n\nThe maximum adsorption capacity is represented by the value of P when θ = 1. This value depends on the Langmuir constant K, which is specific to the gas-solid system and temperature. Once you have the value of K, you can calculate the maximum adsorption capacity for the specific gas and solid surface at the given temperature."
