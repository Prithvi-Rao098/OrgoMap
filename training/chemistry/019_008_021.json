    "message_2": "To find the standard electrode potential of the half-cell reaction AgCl(s) + e- -> Ag(s) + Cl-(aq) at 25°C, we need to use the Nernst equation. The Nernst equation is:\n\nE = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\n\nwhere:\n- E is the electrode potential at non-standard conditions\n- E° is the standard electrode potential\n- R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\n- T is the temperature in Kelvin (25°C = 298.15 K)\n- n is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction (1 in this case)\n- F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol)\n- Q is the reaction quotient\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard electrode potential (E°) for the half-cell reaction. We can find this by looking up the standard reduction potentials for the two half-reactions involved:\n\nAg+ + e- -> Ag(s)  E° = +0.7996 V\nCl2 + 2e- -> 2Cl-  E° = +1.358 V\n\nSince we are given the half-cell reaction AgCl(s) + e- -> Ag(s) + Cl-(aq), we need to reverse the second half-reaction and divide its standard reduction potential by 2:\n\n2Cl- -> Cl2 + 2e-  E° = -1.358 V\n\nNow, we can combine the two half-reactions to get the overall reaction:\n\nAgCl(s) + e- -> Ag(s) + Cl-(aq)\n\nThe standard electrode potential for this reaction is the sum of the standard reduction potentials of the two half-reactions:\n\nE° = +0.7996 V - (1/2) * 1.358 V = +0.7996 V - 0.679 V = +0.1206 V\n\nNow, we need to find the reaction quotient (Q). Since the reaction is at standard conditions, the concentrations of Ag+ and Cl- are both 1 M. Therefore, Q = 1.\n\nNow we can use the Nernst equation to find the electrode potential at 25°C:\n\nE = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\nE = +0.1206 V - (8.314 J/mol·K * 298.15 K / (1 * 96,485 C/mol)) * ln(1)\n\nSince ln(1) = 0, the second term in the equation is 0:\n\nE = +0.1206 V - 0 = +0.1206 V\n\nThe electrode potential of the half-cell reaction AgCl(s) + e- -> Ag(s) + Cl-(aq) at 25°C is +0.1206 V.\n\nTo determine whether the reaction is spontaneous or non-spontaneous, we can look at the sign of the electrode potential. If the electrode potential is positive, the reaction is spontaneous. If it is negative, the reaction is non-spontaneous.\n\nSince the electrode potential is +0.1206 V, the reaction is spontaneous."
