    "message_2": "Increasing the concentration of a reactant in a chemical reaction affects the equilibrium position according to Le Chatelier's principle. Le Chatelier's principle states that if a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in concentration, temperature, or pressure, the system will adjust its equilibrium position to counteract the change.\n\nWhen the concentration of a reactant is increased, the system will shift its equilibrium position to consume the added reactant and produce more products. This shift helps to re-establish the equilibrium by reducing the stress caused by the increased reactant concentration.\n\nFor example, consider the following reversible reaction:\n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) â‡Œ 2NH3(g)\n\nIn this reaction, nitrogen gas (N2) reacts with hydrogen gas (H2) to form ammonia gas (NH3). Suppose the reaction is at equilibrium, and we increase the concentration of N2. According to Le Chatelier's principle, the system will shift its equilibrium position to the right to consume the added N2 and produce more NH3. This shift will continue until a new equilibrium position is established, with a higher concentration of NH3 and lower concentrations of N2 and H2 than before.\n\nThe reasoning behind this shift is that the increased concentration of N2 creates an imbalance in the reaction, with more reactants available than products. To restore equilibrium, the reaction proceeds in the forward direction, consuming the added N2 and producing more NH3 until the ratio of reactants and products is balanced again."
