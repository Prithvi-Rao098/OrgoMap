    "message_2": "To calculate the theoretical yield of acetylsalicylic acid, we need to first determine the limiting reactant, which in this case is salicylic acid since we have an excess of acetic anhydride. Then, we will use stoichiometry to determine the amount of product formed.\n\n1. Determine the molecular weight of salicylic acid (C7H6O3) and acetylsalicylic acid (C9H8O4).\nSalicylic acid: (7 x 12.01) + (6 x 1.01) + (3 x 16.00) = 138.12 g/mol\nAcetylsalicylic acid: (9 x 12.01) + (8 x 1.01) + (4 x 16.00) = 180.16 g/mol\n\n2. Calculate the moles of salicylic acid.\nmoles = mass / molecular weight\nmoles = 5 g / 138.12 g/mol = 0.0362 mol\n\n3. Use stoichiometry to determine the moles of acetylsalicylic acid produced.\nThe balanced chemical equation for the synthesis of acetylsalicylic acid is:\nC7H6O3 + C4H6O3 â†’ C9H8O4 + C2H4O2\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of salicylic acid reacts to produce 1 mole of acetylsalicylic acid.\n\nmoles of acetylsalicylic acid = moles of salicylic acid = 0.0362 mol\n\n4. Calculate the theoretical yield of acetylsalicylic acid.\nmass = moles x molecular weight\nmass = 0.0362 mol x 180.16 g/mol = 6.52 g\n\nTherefore, the theoretical yield of acetylsalicylic acid that can be produced from 5 grams of salicylic acid and an excess amount of acetic anhydride is 6.52 grams, assuming 100% conversion and purity of the reaction."
