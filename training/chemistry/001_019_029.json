    "message_2": "The major product obtained when 1-bromopropane reacts with sodium ethoxide in ethanol is propene. The reaction mechanism is as follows:\n\n1. Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) acts as a strong base and abstracts a β-hydrogen from 1-bromopropane, forming an alkoxide ion and a bromide ion.\n2. The alkoxide ion undergoes an intramolecular rearrangement, leading to the formation of a double bond between the α and β carbons, resulting in the formation of propene.\n3. The bromide ion and ethanol are released as byproducts.\n\nThe overall reaction can be written as:\n\nCH3CH2CH2Br + NaOEt → CH3CH=CH2 + EtOH + NaBr\n\nThis type of nucleophilic substitution reaction is called an E2 (Elimination, Bimolecular) reaction. In an E2 reaction, the nucleophile acts as a base, abstracting a proton from the substrate, and the leaving group departs simultaneously, leading to the formation of a double bond."
