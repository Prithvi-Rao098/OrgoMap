    "message_1": "A chemistry student must calculate the boiling point of a solution composed of 10 g of glucose (C6H12O6) dissolved in 100 g of water at 1 atm pressure. The boiling point elevation constant for water (Kb) is equal to 0.512°C/m, and the normal boiling point of pure water is 100°C.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the boiling point of the solution, we need to find the boiling point elevation (∆Tb) and add it to the normal boiling point of pure water. The formula for boiling point elevation is:\n\n∆Tb = Kb × molality\n\nFirst, we need to find the molality of the solution. Molality (m) is defined as the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. \n\n1. Calculate the moles of glucose (C6H12O6):\nMolar mass of glucose = (6 × 12.01) + (12 × 1.01) + (6 × 16.00) = 72.06 + 12.12 + 96.00 = 180.18 g/mol\n\nmoles of glucose = mass of glucose / molar mass of glucose\nmoles of glucose = 10 g / 180.18 g/mol = 0.0555 mol\n\n2. Convert the mass of water to kilograms:\nmass of water = 100 g = 0.1 kg\n\n3. Calculate the molality of the solution:\nmolality = moles of glucose / mass of water in kg\nmolality = 0.0555 mol / 0.1 kg = 0.555 mol/kg\n\n4. Calculate the boiling point elevation (∆Tb):\n∆Tb = Kb × molality\n∆Tb = 0.512°C/m × 0.555 m = 0.284°C\n\n5. Add the boiling point elevation to the normal boiling point of pure water:\nNew boiling point = normal boiling point + ∆Tb\nNew boiling point = 100°C + 0.284°C = 100.284°C\n\nThe boiling point of the glucose solution is 100.284°C at 1 atm pressure."
