    "message_2": "When propanal reacts with methanol in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl, the product obtained is an acetal, specifically, 1-methoxypropane. This reaction is an example of acetal formation, which involves the nucleophilic addition of an alcohol to a carbonyl group in the presence of an acid catalyst.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nCH3CH2CHO + CH3OH + HCl → CH3CH2CH(OMe)2 + H2O + HCl\n\nThe mechanism for this reaction involves the following steps:\n\n1. Protonation of the carbonyl oxygen by HCl:\n   CH3CH2CHO + HCl → CH3CH2C(OH)2+\n\n2. Nucleophilic attack of methanol on the protonated carbonyl carbon:\n   CH3CH2C(OH)2+ + CH3OH → CH3CH2C(OH)(OMe) + H2O\n\n3. Deprotonation of the hydroxyl group by methanol:\n   CH3CH2C(OH)(OMe) + CH3OH → CH3CH2C(O-)(OMe) + CH3OH2+\n\n4. Protonation of the methoxide ion by the methanolium ion:\n   CH3CH2C(O-)(OMe) + CH3OH2+ → CH3CH2C(OMe)2 + H2O\n\nOverall, the reaction proceeds through the formation of a hemiacetal intermediate (CH3CH2C(OH)(OMe)) before finally forming the acetal product, 1-methoxypropane (CH3CH2CH(OMe)2)."
