    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic moment of the complex, we need to determine the number of unpaired electrons in the iron(III) ion. Iron(III) has an oxidation state of +3, so its electronic configuration will be different from that of the neutral iron atom.\n\nThe electronic configuration of a neutral iron atom (Fe) is [Ar] 3d^6 4s^2. When it forms the Fe(III) ion, it loses three electrons, resulting in the electronic configuration [Ar] 3d^5.\n\nNow, we can use the formula for calculating the magnetic moment (μ) based on the number of unpaired electrons (n):\n\nμ = √(n(n+2))\n\nIn the case of Fe(III), there are 5 unpaired electrons (n=5):\n\nμ = √(5(5+2))\nμ = √(5(7))\nμ = √35\n\nThe magnetic moment of the complex formed between iron(III) ion and ethylenediamine ligand (en) with a coordination number of 6 is approximately √35 Bohr magnetons (BM)."
