    "message_1": "What volume of carbon dioxide, measured at standard temperature and pressure, will be produced when 10 grams of calcium carbonate react completely with a solution of hydrochloric acid containing 20 grams of hydrogen chloride?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first need to write a balanced chemical equation for the reaction between calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and hydrochloric acid (HCl):\n\nCaCO3 (s) + 2 HCl (aq) → CaCl2 (aq) + H2O (l) + CO2 (g)\n\nNext, we will need to determine the limiting reactant, which is the reactant that will be completely consumed during the reaction and will determine the amount of product formed.\n\n1. Calculate the moles of each reactant:\n- For calcium carbonate (CaCO3), the molar mass is 40.08 (Ca) + 12.01 (C) + 3 * 16.00 (O) = 100.09 g/mol.\n  Moles of CaCO3 = (10 g) / (100.09 g/mol) = 0.0999 mol\n\n- For hydrogen chloride (HCl), the molar mass is 1.01 (H) + 35.45 (Cl) = 36.46 g/mol.\n  Moles of HCl = (20 g) / (36.46 g/mol) = 0.548 mol\n\n2. Determine the limiting reactant:\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of CaCO3 reacts with 2 moles of HCl. To find out which reactant is limiting, we can compare the mole ratios:\n\nMole ratio of CaCO3 to HCl = (0.0999 mol CaCO3) / (0.548 mol HCl) = 0.182\n\nSince the mole ratio is less than 0.5 (which is the stoichiometric ratio from the balanced equation), CaCO3 is the limiting reactant.\n\n3. Calculate the moles of CO2 produced:\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of CaCO3 produces 1 mole of CO2. Therefore, the moles of CO2 produced will be equal to the moles of the limiting reactant, CaCO3:\n\nMoles of CO2 = 0.0999 mol\n\n4. Calculate the volume of CO2 at standard temperature and pressure (STP):\nAt STP (0°C and 1 atm), 1 mole of an ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters. Therefore, we can calculate the volume of CO2 produced:\n\nVolume of CO2 = (0.0999 mol) * (22.4 L/mol) = 2.24 L\n\nSo, 2.24 liters of carbon dioxide will be produced when 10 grams of calcium carbonate react completely with a solution of hydrochloric acid containing 20 grams of hydrogen chloride at standard temperature and pressure."
