    "message_2": "In the compound HNO3 (nitric acid), the oxidation state of nitrogen can be determined using the oxidation states of hydrogen and oxygen, which are +1 and -2, respectively. \n\nThe compound HNO3 has one hydrogen atom, one nitrogen atom, and three oxygen atoms. Using the oxidation states of hydrogen and oxygen, we can set up an equation to find the oxidation state of nitrogen (x):\n\n(+1) + x + 3(-2) = 0\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx - 6 = -1\nx = +5\n\nSo, the oxidation state of nitrogen in HNO3 is +5."
