    "message_2": "The standard enthalpy change for the fusion of 1.5 moles of solid lead (Pb) to liquid lead at its melting point can be calculated using the molar enthalpy of fusion and the number of moles.\n\nStandard enthalpy change (ΔH) = moles × molar enthalpy of fusion\n\nΔH = 1.5 moles × 4.79 kJ/mol\n\nΔH = 7.185 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the fusion of 1.5 moles of solid lead to liquid lead at its melting point is 7.185 kJ."
