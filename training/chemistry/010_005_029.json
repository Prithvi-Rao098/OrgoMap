    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant (K) for the given reaction, we first need to determine the standard cell potential (E°cell) for the reaction. \n\nThe overall reaction can be obtained by combining the two half-reactions:\n\n1. Cu2+ (aq) + 2 e- -> Cu (s)    E° = +0.34 V\n2. Zn (s) -> Zn2+ (aq) + 2 e-    E° = +0.76 V (reverse the second half-reaction)\n\nAdd the two half-reactions:\nCu2+ (aq) + Zn (s) -> Zn2+ (aq) + Cu (s)\n\nNow, add the standard potentials for the two half-reactions to get the standard cell potential (E°cell):\nE°cell = E°(Cu2+/Cu) + E°(Zn/Zn2+)\nE°cell = +0.34 V + (+0.76 V)\nE°cell = +1.10 V\n\nNow, we can use the Nernst equation to calculate the equilibrium constant (K). The Nernst equation is:\n\nE°cell = (RT/nF) * ln(K)\n\nWhere:\nE°cell = standard cell potential (+1.10 V)\nR = gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\nT = temperature (assuming 298 K)\nn = number of electrons transferred (2 in this case)\nF = Faraday's constant (96485 C/mol)\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for K:\n\nln(K) = (nF * E°cell) / (RT)\n\nNow, plug in the values:\n\nln(K) = (2 * 96485 C/mol * 1.10 V) / (8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K)\n\nln(K) ≈ 50.71\n\nNow, take the exponential of both sides to solve for K:\n\nK ≈ e^(50.71)\n\nK ≈ 6.2 × 10^21\n\nThe equilibrium constant (K) for the reaction Cu2+ (aq) + Zn (s) -> Zn2+ (aq) + Cu (s) is approximately 6.2 × 10^21."
