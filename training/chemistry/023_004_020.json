    "message_2": "To determine the amount of acetylsalicylic acid produced, we need to first find the limiting reactant and then use stoichiometry to calculate the mass of the product.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction between acetic anhydride (C4H6O3) and salicylic acid (C7H6O3) to produce acetylsalicylic acid (C9H8O4) and acetic acid (C2H4O2) is:\n\nC4H6O3 + C7H6O3 â†’ C9H8O4 + C2H4O2\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of each reactant:\n\nMoles of acetic anhydride = mass / molar mass\nMoles of acetic anhydride = 5 g / (4(12.01) + 6(1.01) + 3(16.00)) g/mol = 5 g / 102.09 g/mol = 0.0489 mol\n\nMoles of salicylic acid = mass / molar mass\nMoles of salicylic acid = 3 g / (7(12.01) + 6(1.01) + 3(16.00)) g/mol = 3 g / 138.12 g/mol = 0.0217 mol\n\nSince we have excess acetic anhydride, salicylic acid is the limiting reactant. Now, we can use stoichiometry to find the moles of acetylsalicylic acid produced:\n\nMoles of acetylsalicylic acid = moles of salicylic acid (1 mol acetylsalicylic acid / 1 mol salicylic acid)\nMoles of acetylsalicylic acid = 0.0217 mol\n\nFinally, we can find the mass of acetylsalicylic acid produced:\n\nMass of acetylsalicylic acid = moles * molar mass\nMass of acetylsalicylic acid = 0.0217 mol * (9(12.01) + 8(1.01) + 4(16.00)) g/mol = 0.0217 mol * 180.16 g/mol = 3.91 g\n\nSo, 3.91 grams of acetylsalicylic acid are produced from the reaction between 5 grams of acetic anhydride and 3 grams of salicylic acid, assuming 100% yield and excess acetic anhydride."
