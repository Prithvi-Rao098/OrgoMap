    "message_2": "To calculate the heat of mixing, we first need to determine the number of moles of HCl and NaOH that are reacting. \n\nMoles of HCl = (Volume of HCl) x (Concentration of HCl)\nMoles of HCl = (50 mL) x (0.1 mol/L) = 5 mmol\n\nMoles of NaOH = (Volume of NaOH) x (Concentration of NaOH)\nMoles of NaOH = (50 mL) x (0.1 mol/L) = 5 mmol\n\nSince the moles of HCl and NaOH are equal, the reaction goes to completion, and all of the HCl and NaOH will react to form water and NaCl.\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat of mixing using the heat of neutralization:\n\nHeat of mixing = (moles of HCl) x (heat of neutralization)\nHeat of mixing = (5 mmol) x (-57.5 kJ/mol)\n\nSince we are working with millimoles, we need to convert the heat of neutralization to kJ/mmol:\n\nHeat of mixing = (5 mmol) x (-57.5 kJ/mol) x (1 mol/1000 mmol)\nHeat of mixing = (5 mmol) x (-0.0575 kJ/mmol)\n\nHeat of mixing = -0.2875 kJ\n\nThe heat of mixing when 50 mL of 0.1 M HCl is mixed with 50 mL of 0.1 M NaOH at 25°C is -0.2875 kJ."
