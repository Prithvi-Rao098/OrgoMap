    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change (∆H°) for the neutralization reaction, we first need to determine the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between HCl and NaOH:\n\nHCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H2O(l)\n\nNext, we need to determine the limiting reactant. To do this, we can calculate the moles of each reactant:\n\nmoles of HCl = (volume of HCl) × (concentration of HCl) = (50.0 mL) × (0.100 mol/L) = 5.00 mmol\nmoles of NaOH = (volume of NaOH) × (concentration of NaOH) = (75.0 mL) × (0.0750 mol/L) = 5.625 mmol\n\nSince there are fewer moles of HCl (5.00 mmol) than NaOH (5.625 mmol), HCl is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow, we can use the stoichiometry of the balanced chemical equation to determine the moles of water produced:\n\nmoles of H2O = moles of HCl = 5.00 mmol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the neutralization reaction between a strong acid and a strong base is approximately -55.8 kJ/mol of water produced. Therefore, we can calculate the standard enthalpy change for this reaction:\n\n∆H° = (moles of H2O) × (-55.8 kJ/mol) = (5.00 mmol) × (-55.8 kJ/mol) = -279 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change for the neutralization reaction of 50.0 mL of 0.100 M HCl with 75.0 mL of 0.0750 M NaOH at a constant pressure of 1 atm and a temperature of 25°C is approximately -279 kJ/mol."
