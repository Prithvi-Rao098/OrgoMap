    "message_2": "To calculate the entropy change for an isothermal compression of an ideal gas, we can use the formula:\n\nΔS = n * R * ln(V2/V1)\n\nwhere ΔS is the entropy change, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol*K), V1 is the initial volume, and V2 is the final volume.\n\nGiven:\nn = 1 mole (since it's one mole of helium gas)\nR = 8.314 J/mol*K (gas constant)\nV1 = 10 L = 0.01 m³ (initial volume, converted from liters to cubic meters)\nV2 = 2 L = 0.002 m³ (final volume, converted from liters to cubic meters)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nΔS = (1 mol) * (8.314 J/mol*K) * ln(0.002 m³ / 0.01 m³)\nΔS = 8.314 J/K * ln(0.2)\nΔS ≈ -11.53 J/K\n\nThe entropy change when one mole of helium gas is compressed isothermally at 298 K from a volume of 10 L to 2 L is approximately -11.53 J/K."
