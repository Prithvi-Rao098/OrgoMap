    "message_1": "What is the heat of sublimation of iodine if 50.0 grams of solid iodine sublimes into vapor at 125°C, and later on, the vapor is condensed to form solid iodine at -25°C? The heat capacities of solid and gaseous iodine are 54.16 J/mol·K and 36.69 J/mol·K, respectively. The enthalpy of fusion of solid iodine is 15.43 kJ/mol, and its melting point is at 113.7°C.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the heat of sublimation of iodine, we need to determine the amount of heat absorbed during the sublimation process. The process involves three steps:\n\n1. Heating solid iodine from -25°C to 113.7°C (melting point)\n2. Melting solid iodine at 113.7°C\n3. Heating gaseous iodine from 113.7°C to 125°C\n\nFirst, let's find the number of moles of iodine in 50.0 grams:\nIodine has a molar mass of 253.8 g/mol.\nn = mass / molar mass\nn = 50.0 g / 253.8 g/mol\nn = 0.197 mol\n\nNow, let's calculate the heat absorbed in each step:\n\n1. Heating solid iodine from -25°C to 113.7°C:\nq1 = n * C_solid * ΔT\nq1 = 0.197 mol * 54.16 J/mol·K * (113.7°C - (-25°C))\nq1 = 0.197 mol * 54.16 J/mol·K * 138.7 K\nq1 = 1464.6 J\n\n2. Melting solid iodine at 113.7°C:\nq2 = n * ΔH_fusion\nq2 = 0.197 mol * 15.43 kJ/mol\nq2 = 3.04 kJ\nq2 = 3040 J (converted to Joules)\n\n3. Heating gaseous iodine from 113.7°C to 125°C:\nq3 = n * C_gas * ΔT\nq3 = 0.197 mol * 36.69 J/mol·K * (125°C - 113.7°C)\nq3 = 0.197 mol * 36.69 J/mol·K * 11.3 K\nq3 = 81.1 J\n\nNow, let's sum up the heat absorbed in all three steps:\nq_total = q1 + q2 + q3\nq_total = 1464.6 J + 3040 J + 81.1 J\nq_total = 4585.7 J\n\nFinally, let's calculate the heat of sublimation per mole of iodine:\nΔH_sublimation = q_total / n\nΔH_sublimation = 4585.7 J / 0.197 mol\nΔH_sublimation = 23270 J/mol\n\nThe heat of sublimation of iodine is approximately 23.27 kJ/mol."
