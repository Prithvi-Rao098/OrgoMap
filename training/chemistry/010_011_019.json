Given that the cell reaction is Zn(s) + Pb2+(aq) → Zn2+(aq) + Pb(s) and the concentration of Pb2+(aq) is 0.25 M. Assume T=298 K and the Faraday constant F= 96,500 C/mol.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the efficiency of the electrochemical cell, we first need to determine the actual potential of the cell under non-standard conditions using the Nernst equation. The Nernst equation is given by:\n\nE = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\n\nwhere E is the actual potential, E° is the standard potential, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin, n is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction, F is the Faraday constant, and Q is the reaction quotient.\n\nFor the given cell reaction, Zn(s) + Pb2+(aq) → Zn2+(aq) + Pb(s), the number of electrons transferred (n) is 2. The reaction quotient (Q) can be expressed as:\n\nQ = [Zn2+]/[Pb2+]\n\nSince we are not given the concentration of Zn2+, we will assume that the concentration of Zn2+ is 1 M (standard conditions). Therefore, Q = 1/0.25 = 4.\n\nNow we can plug in the values into the Nernst equation:\n\nE = 1.23 - (8.314 * 298 / (2 * 96,500)) * ln(4)\nE ≈ 1.23 - 0.028 * ln(4)\nE ≈ 1.23 - 0.028 * 1.386\nE ≈ 1.23 - 0.0388\nE ≈ 1.1912 V\n\nThe actual potential of the cell under the given experimental conditions is 1.1912 V. However, the problem states that the actual potential of the cell is 0.95 V. This discrepancy could be due to various factors such as resistance in the cell or errors in the experimental setup.\n\nTo calculate the efficiency of the cell, we can use the following formula:\n\nEfficiency = (Actual potential / Maximum potential) * 100\n\nEfficiency = (0.95 V / 1.1912 V) * 100\nEfficiency ≈ 79.77%\n\nThe efficiency of the electrochemical cell under the given experimental conditions is approximately 79.77%."
