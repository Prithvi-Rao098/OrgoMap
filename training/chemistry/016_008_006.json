    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat required to melt 25 g of ice at 0°C, we can use the formula:\n\nQ = mass × enthalpy of fusion\n\nwhere Q is the heat required, mass is the mass of ice, and enthalpy of fusion is the energy required to change 1 gram of ice to water at 0°C.\n\nGiven:\nMass of ice = 25 g\nEnthalpy of fusion = 333 J/g\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nQ = 25 g × 333 J/g\n\nQ = 8325 J\n\nTherefore, the amount of heat required to melt 25 g of ice at 0°C is 8325 Joules."
