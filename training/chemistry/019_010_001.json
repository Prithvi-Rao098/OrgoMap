The student is given the following information: \n\n    CH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(l)   ΔH°rxn = -890.4 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy of formation of CH4(g) and H2O(l) are -74.8 kJ/mol and -285.8 kJ/mol, respectively. Using this data, what is the standard enthalpy change for the combustion reaction of methane (CH4) to produce carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) at 298 K?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the combustion reaction of methane, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH°rxn = Σ ΔH°f(products) - Σ ΔH°f(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH°rxn is the standard enthalpy change for the reaction, ΔH°f(products) is the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of the products, and ΔH°f(reactants) is the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of the reactants.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard enthalpy of formation for CO2(g). We can use the given ΔH°rxn and the enthalpies of formation for CH4(g) and H2O(l) to do this:\n\n-890.4 kJ/mol = [ΔH°f(CO2) + 2 × ΔH°f(H2O)] - [ΔH°f(CH4) + 2 × ΔH°f(O2)]\n\nSince the standard enthalpy of formation for an element in its standard state (O2(g) in this case) is zero, we can simplify the equation:\n\n-890.4 kJ/mol = [ΔH°f(CO2) + 2 × (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - (-74.8 kJ/mol)\n\nNow, we can solve for ΔH°f(CO2):\n\nΔH°f(CO2) = -890.4 kJ/mol + 74.8 kJ/mol - 2 × (-285.8 kJ/mol)\nΔH°f(CO2) = -393.5 kJ/mol\n\nNow that we have the standard enthalpy of formation for CO2(g), we can calculate the standard enthalpy change for the combustion reaction of methane:\n\nΔH°rxn = [ΔH°f(CO2) + 2 × ΔH°f(H2O)] - [ΔH°f(CH4) + 2 × ΔH°f(O2)]\nΔH°rxn = [(-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 × (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [(-74.8 kJ/mol) + 2 × (0 kJ/mol)]\nΔH°rxn = -965.1 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the combustion reaction of methane (CH4) to produce carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) at 298 K is -965.1 kJ/mol."
