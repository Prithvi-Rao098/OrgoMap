    "message_2": "To determine the concentration of chloride ions in a given solution using a chloride ion-selective electrode, you will need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calibrate the chloride ion-selective electrode:\n   a. Prepare two standard solutions with known concentrations of chloride ions (e.g., 10 ppm and 100 ppm).\n   b. Immerse the electrode in the first standard solution and wait for the reading to stabilize.\n   c. Record the millivolt (mV) reading and the corresponding concentration.\n   d. Repeat the process for the second standard solution.\n   e. Plot the mV readings against the logarithm of the concentrations to create a calibration curve.\n\n2. Measure the chloride ion concentration in the unknown solution:\n   a. Rinse the electrode with distilled water and immerse it in the unknown solution.\n   b. Wait for the reading to stabilize and record the mV reading.\n\n3. Determine the concentration of chloride ions in the unknown solution:\n   a. Locate the mV reading of the unknown solution on the calibration curve.\n   b. Find the corresponding concentration by interpolating or extrapolating from the calibration curve.\n\nThe concentration obtained from the calibration curve is the concentration of chloride ions in the given solution."
