    "message_1": "What is the change in entropy (ΔS) when 2 moles of ammonia (NH3) react with 3 moles of oxygen gas (O2) to produce 2 moles of nitrogen gas (N2) and 6 moles of water vapor (H2O) at a constant pressure and temperature of 25°C and 1 atm? Given that the standard molar entropies of NH3, O2, N2, and H2O are 192.45 J/K·mol, 205.03 J/K·mol, 191.61 J/K·mol, and 188.72 J/K·mol, respectively.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the change in entropy (ΔS) for the reaction, we can use the formula:\n\nΔS = ΣnS(products) - ΣnS(reactants)\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of each substance and S is the standard molar entropy of each substance.\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\n2 NH3 (g) + 3 O2 (g) → 2 N2 (g) + 6 H2O (g)\n\nThe change in entropy (ΔS) can be calculated as follows:\n\nΔS = [2 moles N2 × 191.61 J/K·mol + 6 moles H2O × 188.72 J/K·mol] - [2 moles NH3 × 192.45 J/K·mol + 3 moles O2 × 205.03 J/K·mol]\n\nΔS = [2 × 191.61 + 6 × 188.72] - [2 × 192.45 + 3 × 205.03]\n\nΔS = [383.22 + 1132.32] - [384.9 + 615.09]\n\nΔS = 1515.54 - 999.99\n\nΔS = 515.55 J/K\n\nSo the change in entropy (ΔS) for the reaction is 515.55 J/K."
