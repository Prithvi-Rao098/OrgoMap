    "message_2": "To calculate the lattice energy of CaCl2, we can use the Born-Lande equation:\n\nLattice Energy (U) = (N * A * (1 - 1/n) * e^2) / (4 * π * ε₀ * r₀)\n\nwhere:\nN = Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23 mol^-1)\nA = Madelung constant (for CaCl2, A = 1.748)\nn = Born exponent (for CaCl2, n ≈ 8-10, we will use n = 9)\ne = elementary charge (1.602 x 10^-19 C)\nε₀ = vacuum permittivity (8.854 x 10^-12 C² / N m²)\nr₀ = distance between the ions (2.80 Angstroms = 2.80 x 10^-10 m)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the lattice energy:\n\nU = (6.022 x 10^23 * 1.748 * (1 - 1/9) * (1.602 x 10^-19)^2) / (4 * π * 8.854 x 10^-12 * 2.80 x 10^-10)\nU ≈ 2.15 x 10^-18 J/ion\n\nTo convert the lattice energy to kJ/mol, we can multiply by Avogadro's number:\n\nU = 2.15 x 10^-18 J/ion * 6.022 x 10^23 ions/mol\nU ≈ 1294 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the lattice energy of CaCl2 is approximately 1294 kJ/mol."
