    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which reactant is the limiting reactant and then calculate the mass of potassium chloride (KCl) that can be formed.\n\nFirst, we need the molar masses of the elements involved:\n- Potassium (K): 39.10 g/mol\n- Chlorine (Cl): 35.45 g/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the moles of each reactant:\n- Moles of potassium (K): 15 g / 39.10 g/mol = 0.3836 mol\n- Moles of chlorine (Cl2): 20 g / (2 * 35.45 g/mol) = 0.2823 mol\n\nNext, we need to determine the limiting reactant by comparing the mole ratio of the reactants to the balanced equation:\n- Mole ratio of K to Cl2: 0.3836 mol K / 0.2823 mol Cl2 = 1.359\n\nSince the balanced equation requires a 2:1 ratio of K to Cl2, and we have a ratio of 1.359, potassium (K) is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow, we can calculate the moles of potassium chloride (KCl) that can be formed using the balanced equation:\n- Moles of KCl = 0.3836 mol K * (2 mol KCl / 2 mol K) = 0.3836 mol KCl\n\nFinally, we can convert the moles of KCl to grams:\n- Mass of KCl = 0.3836 mol KCl * (39.10 g/mol K + 35.45 g/mol Cl) = 0.3836 mol KCl * 74.55 g/mol = 28.61 g\n\nSo, 28.61 grams of potassium chloride (KCl) can be formed when 15 grams of potassium (K) reacts with 20 grams of chlorine (Cl2)."
