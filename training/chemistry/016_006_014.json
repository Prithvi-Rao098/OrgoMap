    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of 2.5 moles of methane, you can use the following formula:\n\nEnthalpy change = moles of methane × enthalpy of combustion per mole\n\nEnthalpy change = 2.5 moles × (-890 kJ/mol)\n\nEnthalpy change = -2225 kJ\n\nSo, the enthalpy change when 2.5 moles of methane are burned completely in excess oxygen gas is -2225 kJ."
