    "message_2": "To determine the activation energy (Ea) for the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen to form water, we can use the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk = A * e^(-Ea / RT)\n\nwhere k is the rate constant, A is the pre-exponential factor, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/molÂ·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin, and Ea is the activation energy.\n\nWe are given the rate constant (k) and the temperature (T), but we do not have the pre-exponential factor (A). Unfortunately, we cannot solve for the activation energy without this information.\n\nHowever, if you can provide the pre-exponential factor or the rate constant at another temperature, we can use the Arrhenius equation to solve for the activation energy."
