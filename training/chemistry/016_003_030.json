    "message_2": "To calculate the bond dissociation energy of a single C-H bond in methane, we need to find the energy required to break one C-H bond. We are given the enthalpy change for breaking all four C-H bonds in methane, which is 1665 kJ/mol. \n\nSince there are four C-H bonds in methane, we can divide the total enthalpy change by the number of bonds to find the bond dissociation energy for one C-H bond:\n\nBond dissociation energy of one C-H bond = (Enthalpy change for breaking all four C-H bonds) / (Number of C-H bonds)\nBond dissociation energy of one C-H bond = 1665 kJ/mol / 4\nBond dissociation energy of one C-H bond = 416.25 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the bond dissociation energy of the C-H bond in methane is 416.25 kJ/mol."
