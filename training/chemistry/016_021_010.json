    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change of polymerization for the formation of polystyrene from its monomer, styrene, we need to consider the bonds broken and bonds formed during the process. \n\nIn the polymerization process, the double bond (C=C) in styrene is broken and a single bond (C-C) is formed between the styrene monomers. \n\n1. Bonds broken: One C=C bond in each styrene monomer\n2. Bonds formed: One C-C bond between each styrene monomer\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the polymerization process using the given bond enthalpies:\n\nΔH_polymerization = (Bonds formed - Bonds broken)\n\nΔH_polymerization = [(1 × C-C) - (1 × C=C)]\n\nUsing the given bond enthalpies:\n\nΔH_polymerization = [(1 × 347 kJ/mol) - (1 × 611 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH_polymerization = -264 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the enthalpy change of polymerization for the formation of polystyrene from its monomer, styrene, is -264 kJ/mol."
