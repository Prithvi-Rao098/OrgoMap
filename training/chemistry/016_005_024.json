    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change of combustion for propane, we need to use Hess's Law, which states that the total enthalpy change for a reaction is the sum of the enthalpy changes for the individual steps in the reaction. In this case, we need to consider the enthalpy of formation for the products and reactants.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the combustion of propane is:\n\nC3H8 (g) + 5O2 (g) -> 3CO2 (g) + 4H2O (l)\n\nThe enthalpy of formation for propane is given as -104 kJ/mol. We also need the enthalpy of formation for CO2 (g) and H2O (l). The standard enthalpy of formation for CO2 (g) is -393.5 kJ/mol, and for H2O (l) is -285.8 kJ/mol.\n\nUsing Hess's Law, we can calculate the enthalpy change of combustion (ΔH_combustion) as follows:\n\nΔH_combustion = [Σ (moles of products × enthalpy of formation of products)] - [Σ (moles of reactants × enthalpy of formation of reactants)]\n\nΔH_combustion = [(3 × -393.5) + (4 × -285.8)] - [(1 × -104) + (5 × 0)]\n\nNote that the enthalpy of formation for O2 (g) is 0 kJ/mol because it is in its standard state.\n\nΔH_combustion = [(-1180.5) + (-1143.2)] - [(-104) + (0)]\n\nΔH_combustion = (-2323.7) - (-104)\n\nΔH_combustion = -2219.7 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy change of combustion for propane is -2219.7 kJ/mol."
