    "message_2": "To determine the bond order of O2 using molecular orbital theory, we need to consider the electron configuration of oxygen and then fill the molecular orbitals accordingly.\n\nOxygen has 8 electrons, so O2 has a total of 16 electrons. The molecular orbitals for O2 can be filled in the following order: σ1s, σ*1s, σ2s, σ*2s, σ2pz, π2px = π2py, π*2px = π*2py.\n\nFilling the molecular orbitals with 16 electrons, we get:\n\n1. σ1s: 2 electrons\n2. σ*1s: 2 electrons\n3. σ2s: 2 electrons\n4. σ*2s: 2 electrons\n5. σ2pz: 2 electrons\n6. π2px = π2py: 4 electrons (2 electrons in each orbital)\n7. π*2px = π*2py: 2 electrons (1 electron in each orbital)\n\nNow, we can calculate the bond order using the formula:\n\nBond order = (number of electrons in bonding orbitals - number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\n\nBond order = (2 + 2 + 4 - 2) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3\n\nTherefore, the bond order of O2 is 3."
