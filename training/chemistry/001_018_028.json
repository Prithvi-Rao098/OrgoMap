    "message_2": "To calculate the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid (CH3COOH), we need to know the acid dissociation constant (Ka) for acetic acid. The Ka for acetic acid at 25°C is 1.8 x 10^-5.\n\nThe dissociation of acetic acid in water can be represented by the following equilibrium equation:\n\nCH3COOH (aq) ⇌ CH3COO- (aq) + H+ (aq)\n\nWe can set up an equilibrium expression using the Ka value:\n\nKa = [CH3COO-][H+]/[CH3COOH]\n\nLet x represent the concentration of H+ ions and CH3COO- ions at equilibrium. Since the initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.1 M, the equilibrium concentrations can be represented as:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.1 - x\n[CH3COO-] = x\n[H+] = x\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the Ka expression:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 = (x)(x)/(0.1 - x)\n\nSince Ka is very small, we can assume that x is much smaller than 0.1, so we can simplify the equation:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 ≈ x^2/0.1\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx^2 = 1.8 x 10^-5 * 0.1\nx^2 = 1.8 x 10^-6\nx = √(1.8 x 10^-6)\nx ≈ 1.34 x 10^-3\n\nNow that we have the concentration of H+ ions (x), we can calculate the pH:\n\npH = -log[H+]\npH = -log(1.34 x 10^-3)\npH ≈ 2.87\n\nThe pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid at 25°C is approximately 2.87."
