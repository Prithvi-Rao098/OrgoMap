    "message_2": "The standard enthalpy change for the phase transition of solid water (ice) to liquid water at 0 degrees Celsius is known as the enthalpy of fusion. For water, the enthalpy of fusion is approximately 6.01 kJ/mol. This value represents the amount of energy required to convert 1 mole of ice at 0 degrees Celsius to liquid water at the same temperature."
