    "message_1": "A student performed an experiment in which 2.1 moles of nitrogen and 0.8 moles of hydrogen react to form ammonia gas. If the equilibrium constant for the reaction is 3.5 x 10^-4 at a certain temperature, what is the equilibrium concentration of ammonia?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to first write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nN₂(g) + 3H₂(g) ⇌ 2NH₃(g)\n\nNext, we need to determine the initial concentrations of the reactants and products. Since we are not given the volume of the reaction, we can assume a volume of 1 L for simplicity. This means that the initial concentrations are:\n\n[N₂]₀ = 2.1 moles/L\n[H₂]₀ = 0.8 moles/L\n[NH₃]₀ = 0 moles/L\n\nNow, let's define the changes in the concentrations at equilibrium using a variable x:\n\n[N₂] = 2.1 - x moles/L\n[H₂] = 0.8 - 3x moles/L\n[NH₃] = 2x moles/L\n\nWe can now write the expression for the equilibrium constant, K:\n\nK = [NH₃]² / ([N₂] * [H₂]³)\n\nPlugging in the equilibrium concentrations and the given value of K (3.5 x 10^-4):\n\n(3.5 x 10^-4) = (2x)² / ((2.1 - x) * (0.8 - 3x)³)\n\nThis is a complex equation to solve algebraically. However, we can make an assumption that x is small compared to the initial concentrations of N₂ and H₂. This is reasonable because the equilibrium constant is very small, indicating that the reaction does not proceed very far to the right. Therefore, we can approximate:\n\n(3.5 x 10^-4) ≈ (2x)² / (2.1 * 0.8³)\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n(2x)² = (3.5 x 10^-4) * (2.1 * 0.8³)\n(2x)² = (3.5 x 10^-4) * (2.1 * 0.512)\n(2x)² = 3.78 x 10^-4\n2x = sqrt(3.78 x 10^-4)\n2x ≈ 0.01945\nx ≈ 0.009725\n\nNow we can find the equilibrium concentration of ammonia:\n\n[NH₃] = 2x ≈ 2 * 0.009725 ≈ 0.01945 moles/L\n\nSo, the equilibrium concentration of ammonia is approximately 0.01945 moles/L."
