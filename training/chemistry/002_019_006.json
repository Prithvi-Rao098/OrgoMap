    "message_2": "To calculate the melting point of aluminum oxide (Al2O3), we can use the following equation:\n\nMelting point (Tm) = Enthalpy of fusion (ΔHfus) / Entropy of fusion (ΔSfus)\n\nGiven that the enthalpy of fusion (ΔHfus) is 326 kJ/mol and the entropy of fusion (ΔSfus) is 110 J/(mol*K), we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nTm = (326 kJ/mol) / (110 J/(mol*K))\n\nFirst, we need to convert kJ to J:\n\n326 kJ/mol * (1000 J/1 kJ) = 326000 J/mol\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the equation:\n\nTm = (326000 J/mol) / (110 J/(mol*K))\n\nTm = 2963.64 K\n\nThe melting point of aluminum oxide (Al2O3) is approximately 2964 K."
