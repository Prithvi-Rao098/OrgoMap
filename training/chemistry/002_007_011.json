    "message_2": "When potassium permanganate (KMnO₄) reacts with hydrochloric acid (HCl), the products formed are potassium chloride (KCl), manganese(II) chloride (MnCl₂), water (H₂O), and chlorine gas (Cl₂). The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\n2 KMnO₄ + 16 HCl → 2 KCl + 2 MnCl₂ + 8 H₂O + 5 Cl₂\n\nThis reaction is a redox reaction (reduction-oxidation reaction) because the oxidation states of the elements change during the reaction. In this case, manganese in potassium permanganate is reduced from +7 to +2, while chlorine in hydrochloric acid is oxidized from -1 to 0."
