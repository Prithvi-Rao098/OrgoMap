    "message_2": "To find the bond dissociation energy of the carbon-carbon double bond in ethene, we first need to determine the total energy required to break all the bonds in ethene. The given reaction is:\n\nC2H4(g) -> 2C(g) + 2H2(g)\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for this reaction is +1360 kJ/mol. This value represents the energy required to break all the bonds in ethene and form the products.\n\nEthene (C2H4) has the following bonds:\n\n1 carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)\n4 carbon-hydrogen single bonds (C-H)\n\nWe need to find the bond dissociation energy for the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). To do this, we first need to find the bond dissociation energy for the carbon-hydrogen single bonds (C-H).\n\nThe bond dissociation energy for a C-H bond is approximately 413 kJ/mol. Since there are 4 C-H bonds in ethene, the total energy required to break all the C-H bonds is:\n\n4 * 413 kJ/mol = 1652 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can find the bond dissociation energy for the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) by subtracting the energy required to break the C-H bonds from the total energy required to break all the bonds in ethene:\n\nBond dissociation energy (C=C) = Total energy - Energy for C-H bonds\nBond dissociation energy (C=C) = 1360 kJ/mol - 1652 kJ/mol\nBond dissociation energy (C=C) = -292 kJ/mol\n\nHowever, the bond dissociation energy cannot be negative. This indicates that there is an error in the given standard enthalpy change for the reaction. Please check the given value and try again."
