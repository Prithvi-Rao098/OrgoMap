    "message_2": "To provide a detailed analysis of the IR spectrum of Compound X, I would need the structure or formula of the compound. However, I can give you a general idea of how to interpret an IR spectrum and identify functional groups.\n\nInfrared spectroscopy is a technique used to identify functional groups in a molecule based on their characteristic absorption frequencies. The IR spectrum is a plot of the intensity of absorbed IR radiation (y-axis) versus the wavenumber (x-axis, in cm⁻¹).\n\nHere are some common functional groups and their respective peak frequencies in the IR spectrum:\n\n1. O-H (alcohol): Broad peak around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹\n2. O-H (carboxylic acid): Broad peak around 2500-3300 cm⁻¹\n3. N-H (amine): Sharp peak around 3300-3500 cm⁻¹\n4. C-H (alkane): Peaks around 2850-3000 cm⁻¹\n5. C=C (alkene): Peaks around 1600-1680 cm⁻¹\n6. C=O (carbonyl): Sharp peak around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹ (ester, ketone, aldehyde), 1650-1700 cm⁻¹ (amide), or 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ (carboxylic acid)\n7. C≡C (alkyne): Peak around 2100-2250 cm⁻¹\n8. C≡N (nitrile): Peak around 2220-2260 cm⁻¹\n9. C-N (amine): Peak around 1000-1250 cm⁻¹\n\nTo interpret the IR spectrum of Compound X, follow these steps:\n\n1. Examine the spectrum and identify the peaks or absorption bands.\n2. Compare the peak frequencies and intensities with the characteristic frequencies of common functional groups listed above.\n3. Determine which functional groups are present in the compound based on the observed peaks.\n4. Consider the relative intensities of the peaks, as this can provide additional information about the functional groups and their environment in the molecule.\n\nPlease provide the structure or formula of Compound X for a more specific analysis."
