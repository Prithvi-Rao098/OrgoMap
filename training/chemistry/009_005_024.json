    "message_2": "To calculate the binding energy per nucleon of a carbon-12 nucleus, we first need to find the mass defect. The mass defect is the difference between the combined mass of the individual protons and neutrons and the actual mass of the carbon-12 nucleus.\n\nCarbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. So, the combined mass of the protons and neutrons is:\n\n(6 protons * 1.00727647 amu/proton) + (6 neutrons * 1.0086649 amu/neutron) = 6.04365882 amu + 6.0519894 amu = 12.09564822 amu\n\nNow, we can find the mass defect:\n\nMass defect = Combined mass - Actual mass = 12.09564822 amu - 11.996739 amu = 0.09890922 amu\n\nNext, we need to convert the mass defect to energy using the Einstein's mass-energy equivalence formula, E=mc^2. Here, 1 amu is equivalent to 931.5 MeV (mega-electron volts).\n\nBinding energy = Mass defect * 931.5 MeV/amu = 0.09890922 amu * 931.5 MeV/amu = 92.162 MeV\n\nFinally, we can find the binding energy per nucleon by dividing the binding energy by the number of nucleons (protons + neutrons) in the carbon-12 nucleus:\n\nBinding energy per nucleon = Binding energy / Total nucleons = 92.162 MeV / 12 = 7.680167 MeV/nucleon\n\nSo, the binding energy per nucleon of a carbon-12 nucleus is approximately 7.68 MeV/nucleon."
