    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy of formation of ethane (C2H6), we need to consider the bond energies of the reactants and products.\n\nThe equation for the formation of ethane is:\nC(graphite) + 3H2(g) -> C2H6(g)\n\nFirst, let's determine the bond energies of the reactants:\n1 C-C bond in graphite: 0 kJ/mol (since it's in its standard state)\n3 H-H bonds in H2(g): 3 * 436 kJ/mol (average bond energy for H-H)\n\nTotal bond energy of reactants = 0 + 3 * 436 = 1308 kJ/mol\n\nNow, let's determine the bond energies of the products:\n1 C-C bond in C2H6: 347 kJ/mol\n6 C-H bonds in C2H6: 6 * 413 kJ/mol\n\nTotal bond energy of products = 347 + 6 * 413 = 347 + 2478 = 2825 kJ/mol\n\nFinally, we can calculate the standard enthalpy of formation of ethane (C2H6) using the bond energies of the reactants and products:\n\nΔHf = Bond energy of products - Bond energy of reactants\nΔHf = 2825 kJ/mol - 1308 kJ/mol\nΔHf = 1517 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation of ethane (C2H6) is 1517 kJ/mol."
