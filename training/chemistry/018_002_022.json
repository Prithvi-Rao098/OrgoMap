    "message_2": "To find the rate constant (k) of a first-order reaction, we can use the integrated rate law for first-order reactions:\n\nln([A]t / [A]0) = -kt\n\nwhere [A]t is the concentration of reactant A at time t, [A]0 is the initial concentration of reactant A, and t is the time elapsed.\n\nGiven:\n[A]0 = 0.1 M\n[A]t = 0.05 M\nt = 30 minutes = 1800 seconds (since we need to use the time in seconds)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the integrated rate law equation:\n\nln(0.05 / 0.1) = -k * 1800\n\nln(0.5) = -k * 1800\n\nk = -ln(0.5) / 1800\n\nk ≈ 0.000385 s⁻¹\n\nSo, the rate constant of the first-order reaction is approximately 0.000385 s⁻¹."
