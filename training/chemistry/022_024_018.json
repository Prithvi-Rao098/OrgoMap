    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first determine the concentration of acetic acid (HAc) in the buffer solution using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n5.0 = 4.76 + log([NaAc]/[HAc])\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for [HAc]:\n\n[HAc] = [NaAc] / 10^(pH - pKa)\n[HAc] = 0.2 M / 10^(5.0 - 4.76)\n[HAc] = 0.2 M / 10^0.24\n[HAc] ≈ 0.2 M / 1.74\n[HAc] ≈ 0.115 M\n\nNow that we have the concentration of acetic acid, we can determine the moles of acetic acid in the 100 mL buffer solution:\n\nmoles of HAc = volume × concentration\nmoles of HAc = 0.1 L × 0.115 mol/L\nmoles of HAc ≈ 0.0115 mol\n\nSince hydrochloric acid (HCl) neutralizes acetic acid (HAc) in a 1:1 ratio, we need an equal amount of moles of HCl to neutralize the buffer solution:\n\nmoles of HCl = moles of HAc\nmoles of HCl ≈ 0.0115 mol\n\nNow we can determine the volume of 0.1 M HCl needed to neutralize the buffer solution:\n\nvolume of HCl = moles of HCl / concentration of HCl\nvolume of HCl = 0.0115 mol / 0.1 mol/L\nvolume of HCl ≈ 0.115 L or 115 mL\n\nTherefore, approximately 115 mL of 0.1 M hydrochloric acid is required to completely neutralize the 100 mL of 0.2 M sodium acetate buffer solution at a pH of 5.0."
