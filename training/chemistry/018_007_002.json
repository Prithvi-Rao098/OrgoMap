    "message_1": "What is the effect of increasing the surface area on the reaction rate of the reaction between magnesium ribbon and hydrochloric acid?",
    "message_2": "Increasing the surface area of the magnesium ribbon in the reaction with hydrochloric acid will result in an increased reaction rate. This is because a larger surface area allows for more contact points between the magnesium and the hydrochloric acid, leading to more frequent collisions between the reactant particles. According to the collision theory, a higher frequency of collisions results in a faster reaction rate. Therefore, by increasing the surface area of the magnesium ribbon, the reaction rate between magnesium and hydrochloric acid will increase."
