    "message_2": "The percent yield is calculated by dividing the actual (practical) yield by the theoretical yield, and then multiplying by 100.\n\nPercent Yield = (Actual Yield / Theoretical Yield) x 100\n\nIn this case, the actual yield is 20 grams, and the theoretical yield is 25 grams.\n\nPercent Yield = (20 grams / 25 grams) x 100\n\nPercent Yield = 0.8 x 100\n\nPercent Yield = 80%\n\nThe percent yield of aspirin in this case is 80%."
