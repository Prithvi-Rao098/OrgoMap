    "message_2": "To calculate the change in enthalpy (ΔH) for the reaction, we need to use the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) for each compound involved in the reaction. The standard enthalpies of formation are as follows:\n\nΔHf° (CH4) = -74.8 kJ/mol\nΔHf° (O2) = 0 kJ/mol (since it is an element in its standard state)\nΔHf° (CO2) = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔHf° (H2O) = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can use the following equation to calculate the change in enthalpy for the reaction:\n\nΔH = Σ [ΔHf° (products)] - Σ [ΔHf° (reactants)]\n\nΔH = [1 × (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 × (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [1 × (-74.8 kJ/mol) + 2 × (0 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH = (-393.5 - 571.6) - (-74.8)\n\nΔH = -965.1 + 74.8\n\nΔH = -890.3 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the change in enthalpy (ΔH) for the reaction is -890.3 kJ/mol."
