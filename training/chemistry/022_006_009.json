    "message_2": "To balance the synthesis reaction between magnesium (Mg) and oxygen (O2), we need to make sure that the number of atoms for each element is equal on both sides of the equation. The unbalanced equation is:\n\nMg + O2 → MgO\n\nNow, we balance the equation using the least whole number coefficients:\n\n2Mg + O2 → 2MgO\n\nIn this balanced equation, there are 2 magnesium atoms and 2 oxygen atoms on both sides of the equation, satisfying the law of conservation of mass."
