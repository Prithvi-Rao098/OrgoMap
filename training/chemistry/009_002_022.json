    "message_2": "The final product of the radioactive decay series of Uranium-238 is Lead-206 (Pb-206). The time it takes for Uranium-238 to undergo all the radioactive decay steps is determined by its half-life, which is approximately 4.468 billion years. However, the entire decay series involves multiple intermediate isotopes with their own half-lives, so the time it takes for a specific atom of Uranium-238 to decay into Lead-206 can vary."
