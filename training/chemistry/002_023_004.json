    "message_2": "The conductivity of an inorganic compound is directly related to the concentration of ions present in the solution. In general, as the concentration of the inorganic compound increases, the conductivity of the solution also increases. This is because the number of ions available to carry an electric charge increases with the concentration of the dissolved compound.\n\nIn a solution, the inorganic compound dissociates into its constituent ions. These ions are responsible for conducting electricity through the movement of charge. When the concentration of the inorganic compound is increased, more ions are present in the solution, which leads to a higher conductivity.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that this relationship is not always linear. At very high concentrations, the conductivity may not increase proportionally with the concentration due to factors such as ion-ion interactions, limited mobility of ions, and the formation of ion pairs or complexes. Additionally, the temperature and the nature of the solvent can also influence the conductivity of the solution.\n\nIn summary, the concentration of an inorganic compound generally has a direct impact on its conductivity, with higher concentrations leading to higher conductivity. However, this relationship can be influenced by factors such as ion interactions, temperature, and the solvent used."
