    "message_1": "How will the equilibrium constant (Kc) change if the temperature of the system is increased? Calculate the new Kc value for the following reaction at 100°C if the initial Kc value is 0.0151 at 50°C. \n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g) \n\nThe enthalpy change for the above reaction is -92.4 kJ/mol, and the activation energy is 150 kJ/mol.",
    "message_2": "To determine how the equilibrium constant (Kc) will change when the temperature of the system is increased, we can use the van't Hoff equation:\n\nln(Kc2/Kc1) = -ΔH°/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere Kc1 and Kc2 are the equilibrium constants at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively, ΔH° is the enthalpy change of the reaction, and R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K).\n\nIn this case, we have Kc1 = 0.0151 at T1 = 50°C (323.15 K), and we want to find Kc2 at T2 = 100°C (373.15 K). The enthalpy change for the reaction is -92.4 kJ/mol, which is equal to -92,400 J/mol.\n\nPlugging these values into the van't Hoff equation:\n\nln(Kc2/0.0151) = -(-92,400 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K) * (1/373.15 K - 1/323.15 K)\n\nSolving for Kc2:\n\nKc2 = 0.0151 * exp((-(-92,400 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K)) * (1/373.15 K - 1/323.15 K))\nKc2 ≈ 0.0486\n\nSo, when the temperature of the system is increased from 50°C to 100°C, the equilibrium constant (Kc) increases from 0.0151 to approximately 0.0486. This is because the reaction is exothermic (ΔH° is negative), and increasing the temperature favors the reverse reaction, which is endothermic."
