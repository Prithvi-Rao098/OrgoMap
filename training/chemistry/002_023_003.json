    "message_2": "To find the conductance of the solution, we can use the formula:\n\nConductance (G) = 1 / Resistance (R)\n\nFirst, we need to find the conductivity (κ) of the solution. We can use the formula:\n\nConductivity (κ) = Cell constant (K) × Conductance (G)\n\nWe are given the cell constant (K) as 1.2 cm^-1 and the observed resistance (R) as 80 Ω. Let's find the conductance (G) first:\n\nConductance (G) = 1 / Resistance (R)\nG = 1 / 80 Ω\nG = 0.0125 S (Siemens)\n\nNow, we can find the conductivity (κ) of the solution:\n\nConductivity (κ) = Cell constant (K) × Conductance (G)\nκ = 1.2 cm^-1 × 0.0125 S\nκ = 0.015 S cm^-1\n\nSo, the conductance of the 0.1M KCl solution at 25°C is 0.015 S cm^-1."
