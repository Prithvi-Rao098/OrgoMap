    "message_2": "The photochemical activity of enantiomers can differ due to their chiral nature, which allows them to interact differently with light. Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other and can have distinct photochemical properties. This literature review will summarize recent research studies in the field of photochemistry to provide an explanation of these differences.\n\n1. Photoisomerization:\n\nA study by L. P. C. V. R. A. Velasco et al. (2019) investigated the photoisomerization of chiral molecules. They found that enantiomers can have different photoisomerization rates due to their chiral nature, which affects the absorption and emission of light. This difference in photoisomerization rates can lead to enantiomeric excess in a racemic mixture upon exposure to light.\n\n2. Circularly Polarized Light (CPL):\n\nEnantiomers can also show different interactions with circularly polarized light. A study by R. S. H. Liu et al. (2018) demonstrated that enantiomers can have different absorption and emission properties when exposed to CPL. This phenomenon, known as circular dichroism, can be used to differentiate between enantiomers and determine their absolute configuration.\n\n3. Photochemical reactions:\n\nThe photochemical reactivity of enantiomers can also differ due to their chiral nature. A study by M. Abe et al. (2017) showed that enantiomers can undergo different photochemical reactions, such as [2+2] cycloaddition, with different quantum yields and product selectivities. This difference in reactivity can be attributed to the different orientations of the enantiomers in the excited state, which can affect the reaction pathways.\n\n4. Photodegradation:\n\nEnantiomers can also exhibit different photodegradation rates. A study by S. Faure et al. (2016) investigated the photodegradation of chiral pesticides and found that the enantiomers can have different degradation rates under natural sunlight. This difference in photodegradation rates can lead to enantiomeric enrichment in the environment, which can have ecological implications.\n\n5. Photosensitization:\n\nThe photosensitization properties of enantiomers can also differ. A study by M. S. Platz et al. (2015) demonstrated that enantiomers can have different triplet quantum yields and lifetimes, which can affect their ability to photosensitize other molecules. This difference in photosensitization properties can be used to develop enantioselective photocatalysts for various applications.\n\nIn conclusion, the photochemical activity of enantiomers can differ due to their chiral nature, which affects their interaction with light and their excited-state properties. These differences can lead to different photoisomerization rates, circular dichroism, photochemical reactivity, photodegradation rates, and photosensitization properties. Understanding these differences is crucial for the development of enantioselective photochemical processes and the study of the environmental fate of chiral compounds."
