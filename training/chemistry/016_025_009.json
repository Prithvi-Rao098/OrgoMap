    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the dissolution of 10 g of NaOH in 100 mL of water, we need to determine the number of moles of NaOH and then use the molar heat of dissolution to find the enthalpy change.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of moles of NaOH:\n\nThe molar mass of NaOH = 22.99 g/mol (Na) + 15.999 g/mol (O) + 1.007 g/mol (H) = 39.996 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the number of moles:\n\nmoles of NaOH = mass / molar mass\nmoles of NaOH = 10 g / 39.996 g/mol = 0.2501 mol\n\nNow, we can use the molar heat of dissolution to find the enthalpy change:\n\nΔH = moles × molar heat of dissolution\nΔH = 0.2501 mol × (-44.51 kJ/mol) = -11.13 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change for the dissolution of 10 g of NaOH in 100 mL of water at 25°C is -11.13 kJ."
