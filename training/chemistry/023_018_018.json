    "message_2": "To determine the minimum amount of nitric acid required to synthesize 10 grams of 2,4-dinitrophenol from phenol, we need to consider the stoichiometry of the reaction and the given yield.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the synthesis of 2,4-dinitrophenol from phenol and nitric acid is:\n\nC6H5OH (phenol) + 2 HNO3 (nitric acid) → C6H3(NO2)2OH (2,4-dinitrophenol) + 2 H2O (water)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the theoretical yield of 2,4-dinitrophenol:\n\nMolar mass of 2,4-dinitrophenol = 184 g/mol\nMolar mass of phenol = 94 g/mol\n\nSince we want to synthesize 10 grams of 2,4-dinitrophenol with a 90% yield, we need to find the actual amount of phenol required:\n\nActual yield = Theoretical yield × % yield\n10 g = Theoretical yield × 0.9\nTheoretical yield = 10 g / 0.9 = 11.11 g\n\nNow, we need to find the moles of phenol required:\n\nmoles of phenol = mass of phenol / molar mass of phenol\nmoles of phenol = 11.11 g / 94 g/mol = 0.1182 mol\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of phenol reacts with 2 moles of nitric acid. So, we need to find the moles of nitric acid required:\n\nmoles of nitric acid = 2 × moles of phenol\nmoles of nitric acid = 2 × 0.1182 mol = 0.2364 mol\n\nFinally, we need to find the mass of nitric acid required:\n\nMolar mass of nitric acid = 63 g/mol\nmass of nitric acid = moles of nitric acid × molar mass of nitric acid\nmass of nitric acid = 0.2364 mol × 63 g/mol = 14.89 g\n\nTherefore, the minimum amount of nitric acid required to synthesize 10 grams of 2,4-dinitrophenol from phenol, assuming a 90% yield, is 14.89 grams."
