    "message_2": "Transaminases, also known as aminotransferases, are a group of enzymes that play a crucial role in the biosynthesis of amino acids. They are involved in the transfer of an amino group (-NH2) from one molecule (usually an amino acid) to another molecule (usually a keto acid). This process is called transamination.\n\nThe primary role of transaminases in amino acid biosynthesis is to facilitate the interconversion of amino acids and their corresponding keto acids. This interconversion is essential for several reasons:\n\n1. It helps in the synthesis of non-essential amino acids, which are not directly obtained from the diet and need to be synthesized within the body.\n2. It aids in the regulation of amino acid concentrations in the body.\n3. It participates in the catabolism of amino acids, where excess amino acids are broken down and converted into other metabolites, such as glucose or fatty acids.\n\nTransaminases perform the process of transferring an amino group through a two-step reaction mechanism, which involves the following steps:\n\n1. Formation of enzyme-bound intermediate: In the first step, the amino group from the donor amino acid is transferred to the enzyme's active site, which contains a cofactor called pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP). This transfer results in the formation of a keto acid and an enzyme-bound intermediate, where the amino group is now attached to the PLP cofactor.\n\n2. Transfer of amino group to acceptor molecule: In the second step, the amino group from the enzyme-bound intermediate is transferred to the acceptor keto acid, converting it into a new amino acid. Meanwhile, the PLP cofactor is regenerated and remains bound to the enzyme, ready for another round of transamination.\n\nOverall, transaminases play a vital role in amino acid biosynthesis by facilitating the transfer of amino groups between molecules, allowing for the synthesis, regulation, and catabolism of amino acids in the body."
