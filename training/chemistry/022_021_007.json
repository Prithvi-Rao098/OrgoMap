    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction, we first need to write the equilibrium constant expression. For the reaction:\n\n2NOCl(g) ⇌ 2NO(g) + Cl2(g)\n\nThe equilibrium constant expression (Kc) is given by:\n\nKc = [NO]^2 * [Cl2] / [NOCl]^2\n\nNow, we are given the concentrations of NOCl, NO, and Cl2 at equilibrium:\n\n[NOCl] = 0.50 M\n[NO] = 0.10 M\n[Cl2] = 0.10 M\n\nSubstitute these values into the Kc expression:\n\nKc = (0.10)^2 * (0.10) / (0.50)^2\n\nKc = 0.01 * 0.10 / 0.25\n\nKc = 0.001 / 0.25\n\nKc = 0.004\n\nSo, the value of the equilibrium constant (Kc) at this temperature is 0.004."
