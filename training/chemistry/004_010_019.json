    "message_1": "What is the concentration of a solution of iron(II) sulfate if its absorbance at a wavelength of 495 nm is 0.456 in a 1 cm cuvette with a path length of 1 cm? The molar absorptivity of iron(II) sulfate at 495 nm is 8100 L/mol·cm. The molecular weight of iron(II) sulfate is 151.91 g/mol.",
    "message_2": "To find the concentration of the solution, we can use the Beer-Lambert Law, which states:\n\nA = ε * c * l\n\nwhere A is the absorbance, ε is the molar absorptivity, c is the concentration, and l is the path length.\n\nWe are given the following values:\n\nA = 0.456\nε = 8100 L/mol·cm\nl = 1 cm\n\nWe need to solve for c (the concentration):\n\nc = A / (ε * l)\n\nc = 0.456 / (8100 L/mol·cm * 1 cm)\n\nc = 0.456 / 8100 L/mol\n\nc ≈ 5.63 x 10^-5 mol/L\n\nNow we have the concentration in mol/L, but we need to convert it to g/L using the molecular weight of iron(II) sulfate:\n\nmass = concentration * molecular weight\n\nmass = 5.63 x 10^-5 mol/L * 151.91 g/mol\n\nmass ≈ 0.00855 g/L\n\nSo, the concentration of the iron(II) sulfate solution is approximately 0.00855 g/L."
