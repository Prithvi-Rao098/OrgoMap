    "message_2": "To calculate the theoretical yield, we first need to determine the stoichiometry of the reaction and the molecular weights of the reactants and product.\n\nThe reaction is as follows:\nC7H6O2 (benzoic acid) + 2 HNO3 (nitric acid) -> C7H4N2O6 (2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid) + 2 H2O (water)\n\nMolecular weights:\nBenzoic acid (C7H6O2): 7(12.01) + 6(1.01) + 2(16.00) = 122.12 g/mol\n2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid (C7H4N2O6): 7(12.01) + 4(1.01) + 2(14.01) + 6(16.00) = 212.14 g/mol\n\nNow, we can determine the moles of benzoic acid used in the reaction:\nmoles of benzoic acid = mass / molecular weight\nmoles of benzoic acid = 10 g / 122.12 g/mol = 0.0819 mol\n\nAccording to the stoichiometry of the reaction, 1 mole of benzoic acid produces 1 mole of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid. Therefore, the moles of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid produced are the same as the moles of benzoic acid used.\n\nTheoretical yield of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid = moles * molecular weight\nTheoretical yield = 0.0819 mol * 212.14 g/mol = 17.37 g\n\nHowever, the reaction has a 75% yield, so we need to take this into account:\nActual yield = theoretical yield * percentage yield\nActual yield = 17.37 g * 0.75 = 13.03 g\n\nTherefore, the theoretical yield of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid that can be obtained from the reaction of 10 grams of benzoic acid with excess nitric acid, if the reaction has a 75% yield, is approximately 13.03 grams."
