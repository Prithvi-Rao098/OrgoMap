    "message_2": "Carbonic anhydrase is a metalloenzyme that contains a zinc ion (Zn2+) in its active site. The coordination number of the zinc ion in the active site of carbonic anhydrase is 4. This is because the zinc ion is coordinated to three histidine residues from the protein and a water molecule or hydroxide ion, depending on the state of the enzyme. The coordination geometry around the zinc ion is approximately tetrahedral."
