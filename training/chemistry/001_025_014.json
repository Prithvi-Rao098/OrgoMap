    "message_2": "Manipulating the structural properties of biomolecules to create new pharmaceutical drugs with specific biological functions involves several key steps and techniques. Here's a general outline of the process:\n\n1. Identify the target: The first step is to identify the biological target, such as a protein, enzyme, or receptor, that plays a crucial role in a specific disease or condition. This target should be well-characterized and validated to ensure its relevance to the disease.\n\n2. Understand the structure-function relationship: Investigate the structure of the target biomolecule and understand how its structure relates to its function. This can be achieved through techniques such as X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Understanding the structure-function relationship will help in designing drugs that can modulate the target's activity.\n\n3. Design and synthesis of drug candidates: Based on the structural information of the target biomolecule, design drug candidates that can interact with the target and modulate its function. This can be achieved through various approaches, such as rational drug design, fragment-based drug design, and computer-aided drug design. Once the drug candidates are designed, synthesize them using appropriate chemical methods.\n\n4. Evaluate the binding affinity and selectivity: Test the synthesized drug candidates for their ability to bind to the target biomolecule and modulate its function. Techniques such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and fluorescence-based assays can be used to evaluate the binding affinity and selectivity of the drug candidates.\n\n5. Assess the biological activity: Evaluate the drug candidates for their ability to modulate the target's function in a cellular or animal model of the disease. This will help in determining the efficacy of the drug candidates and their potential for further development.\n\n6. Optimize the drug candidates: Based on the results from the binding affinity and biological activity assessments, optimize the drug candidates to improve their potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic properties. This may involve making structural modifications to the drug candidates, such as adding or modifying functional groups, to enhance their interaction with the target biomolecule.\n\n7. Preclinical and clinical testing: Once the drug candidates have been optimized, they need to undergo preclinical testing in animal models to evaluate their safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic properties. If the drug candidates show promising results in preclinical studies, they can proceed to clinical trials in humans to further evaluate their safety and efficacy.\n\nBy following these steps and using various techniques to manipulate the structural properties of biomolecules, new pharmaceutical drugs with specific biological functions can be developed to treat various diseases and conditions."
