    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the BET theory equation for multilayer adsorption. The BET equation is as follows:\n\nV = (V_m * C * P) / [(P_0 - P) * (1 + (C - 1) * P / P_0)]\n\nWhere:\nV = volume of gas adsorbed at pressure P\nV_m = volume of gas adsorbed in a monolayer\nC = BET constant\nP = pressure of the gas\nP_0 = saturation pressure of the gas\n\nHowever, in this problem, we are not given the values for C, P, and P_0. Instead, we are given the monolayer coverage and the specific surface area of activated carbon. We can still find the number of layers of nitrogen molecules adsorbed using the following approach:\n\n1. Calculate the total surface area of activated carbon.\n2. Divide the total surface area by the monolayer coverage to find the number of layers.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total surface area of activated carbon.\nSpecific surface area of activated carbon = 1500 m²/g\nLet's assume we have 1 gram of activated carbon.\nTotal surface area = 1500 m²/g * 1 g = 1500 m²\n\nStep 2: Divide the total surface area by the monolayer coverage to find the number of layers.\nMonolayer coverage = 100 m²/g\nNumber of layers = Total surface area / Monolayer coverage\nNumber of layers = 1500 m² / 100 m²/g = 15 layers\n\nSo, according to the BET theory, 15 layers of nitrogen molecules can be adsorbed on the surface of the given amount of activated carbon."
