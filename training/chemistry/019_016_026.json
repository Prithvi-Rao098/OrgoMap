    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the vaporization of 15 grams of water, we first need to determine the number of moles of water present. The molar mass of water is 18.015 g/mol.\n\nNumber of moles = mass / molar mass\nNumber of moles = 15 g / 18.015 g/mol = 0.8325 mol\n\nNow, we can use the molar enthalpy of vaporization to find the total enthalpy change.\n\nStandard enthalpy change = number of moles × molar enthalpy of vaporization\nStandard enthalpy change = 0.8325 mol × 40.7 kJ/mol = 33.88 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the vaporization of 15 grams of water is 33.88 kJ."
