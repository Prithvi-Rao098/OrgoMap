    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the vaporization of 25 g of liquid nitrogen, we first need to determine the number of moles of nitrogen in the sample. The molar mass of nitrogen (N2) is 28.02 g/mol.\n\nNumber of moles = mass / molar mass\nNumber of moles = 25 g / (28.02 g/mol) = 0.892 mol\n\nNow, we can use the molar heat of vaporization (ΔHvap) to calculate the enthalpy change for the vaporization of the sample.\n\nΔH = number of moles × ΔHvap\nΔH = 0.892 mol × 5.56 kJ/mol = 4.96 kJ\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the vaporization of 25 g of liquid nitrogen at its boiling point is 4.96 kJ."
