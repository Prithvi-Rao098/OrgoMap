    "message_2": "The inorganic solid formed between sodium and chlorine is sodium chloride (NaCl), which is commonly known as table salt. The bonding present in this solid is ionic bonding.\n\nIonic bonding occurs when there is a transfer of electrons between a metal and a non-metal atom. In the case of sodium chloride, sodium (Na) is a metal, and chlorine (Cl) is a non-metal. Sodium has one electron in its outermost shell, while chlorine has seven electrons in its outermost shell. To achieve a stable electron configuration, sodium loses its one valence electron, and chlorine gains one electron to complete its outermost shell.\n\nAs a result of this electron transfer, sodium becomes a positively charged ion (Na+), and chlorine becomes a negatively charged ion (Cl-). The electrostatic attraction between these oppositely charged ions forms the ionic bond, which holds the sodium and chlorine ions together in a crystal lattice structure. This type of bonding results in a highly stable and well-organized solid with high melting and boiling points, as well as good solubility in water."
