    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the stoichiometry of the reaction between aniline and nitric acid to form p-nitroaniline. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nC6H7N + HNO3 → C6H6N2O2 + H2O\n\nAniline (C6H7N) reacts with nitric acid (HNO3) to form p-nitroaniline (C6H6N2O2) and water (H2O).\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of aniline and p-nitroaniline:\n\nMolar mass of aniline (C6H7N) = (6 × 12.01) + (7 × 1.01) + 14.01 = 93.13 g/mol\nMoles of aniline = mass / molar mass = 5 g / 93.13 g/mol = 0.0537 mol\n\nSince the reaction has a 1:1 stoichiometry, the moles of p-nitroaniline produced will be equal to the moles of aniline used:\n\nMoles of p-nitroaniline = 0.0537 mol\n\nNow, we need to find the moles of nitric acid required:\n\nMoles of nitric acid = moles of p-nitroaniline = 0.0537 mol\n\nNext, we need to find the volume of nitric acid required. To do this, we need to know the concentration of the nitric acid solution. Assuming a common laboratory concentration of 70% (w/w) nitric acid, we can calculate the concentration in mol/L:\n\nDensity of 70% nitric acid = 1.42 g/mL\nMass of 1000 mL of 70% nitric acid = 1.42 g/mL × 1000 mL = 1420 g\nMass of HNO3 in 1000 mL of 70% nitric acid = 0.7 × 1420 g = 994 g\n\nMolar mass of HNO3 = 63.01 g/mol\nMoles of HNO3 in 1000 mL of 70% nitric acid = 994 g / 63.01 g/mol = 15.78 mol\nConcentration of 70% nitric acid = 15.78 mol / 1 L = 15.78 mol/L\n\nNow, we can find the volume of nitric acid required:\n\nVolume of nitric acid = moles of nitric acid / concentration of nitric acid\nVolume of nitric acid = 0.0537 mol / 15.78 mol/L = 0.00340 L = 3.40 mL\n\nTherefore, the minimum amount of nitric acid required to prepare 10 g of p-nitroaniline from 5 g of aniline is 3.40 mL (assuming 100% yield and that the reaction goes to completion)."
