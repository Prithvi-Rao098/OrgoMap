    "message_2": "The preparation of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene from nitrobenzene and chlorine gas is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nC6H5NO2 + 2 Cl2 → C6H3Cl2NO2 + 2 HCl\n\nTo calculate the theoretical yield, we need to find the molar mass of nitrobenzene and 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene and then use stoichiometry.\n\nMolar mass of nitrobenzene (C6H5NO2) = (6 × 12.01) + (5 × 1.01) + (1 × 14.01) + (2 × 16.00) = 123.11 g/mol\n\nMolar mass of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene (C6H3Cl2NO2) = (6 × 12.01) + (3 × 1.01) + (2 × 35.45) + (1 × 14.01) + (2 × 16.00) = 180.99 g/mol\n\nNow, we can use stoichiometry to find the theoretical yield:\n\n10 g nitrobenzene × (1 mol nitrobenzene / 123.11 g nitrobenzene) × (1 mol 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene / 1 mol nitrobenzene) × (180.99 g 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene / 1 mol 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene) = 14.71 g 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene\n\nThe theoretical yield of the reaction is 14.71 g of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene."
