    "message_2": "The half-life of uranium-238 (U-238) is approximately 4.468 billion years. The decay process of U-238 involves multiple steps, ultimately leading to the formation of stable lead-206 (Pb-206). The decay series includes alpha and beta decays, and it is also known as the uranium series or 4n+2 series. Here is a simplified version of the decay process:\n\n1. U-238 (alpha decay) -> Th-234 (Thorium-234)\n2. Th-234 (beta decay) -> Pa-234 (Protactinium-234)\n3. Pa-234 (beta decay) -> U-234 (Uranium-234)\n4. U-234 (alpha decay) -> Th-230 (Thorium-230)\n5. Th-230 (alpha decay) -> Ra-226 (Radium-226)\n6. Ra-226 (alpha decay) -> Rn-222 (Radon-222)\n7. Rn-222 (alpha decay) -> Po-218 (Polonium-218)\n8. Po-218 (alpha decay) -> Pb-214 (Lead-214)\n9. Pb-214 (beta decay) -> Bi-214 (Bismuth-214)\n10. Bi-214 (beta decay) -> Po-214 (Polonium-214)\n11. Po-214 (alpha decay) -> Pb-210 (Lead-210)\n12. Pb-210 (beta decay) -> Bi-210 (Bismuth-210)\n13. Bi-210 (beta decay) -> Po-210 (Polonium-210)\n14. Po-210 (alpha decay) -> Pb-206 (Lead-206, stable)\n\nNow, let's calculate the time required for 100 grams of U-238 to decay to 25 grams. Since the half-life is the time it takes for half of the substance to decay, we can use the formula:\n\nFinal mass = Initial mass * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\n25 g = 100 g * (1/2)^(time elapsed / 4.468 billion years)\n\nDivide both sides by 100 g:\n\n0.25 = (1/2)^(time elapsed / 4.468 billion years)\n\nNow, take the logarithm base 1/2 of both sides:\n\nlog_(1/2)(0.25) = time elapsed / 4.468 billion years\n\n-2 = time elapsed / 4.468 billion years\n\nFinally, multiply both sides by 4.468 billion years:\n\ntime elapsed = -2 * 4.468 billion years = -8.936 billion years\n\nHowever, since we cannot have a negative time elapsed, this means that the calculation is incorrect. The correct approach is to recognize that it takes two half-lives for the initial mass to decay to 25% of its original value:\n\ntime elapsed = 2 * 4.468 billion years = 8.936 billion years\n\nSo, it takes approximately 8.936 billion years for 100 grams of uranium-238 to decay to 25 grams."
