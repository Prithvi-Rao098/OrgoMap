    "message_2": "Ionic, covalent, and metallic solids are three main types of crystalline solids, each with their own unique characteristics and properties.\n\n1. Ionic solids:\nDistinguishing characteristics:\n- Ionic solids consist of positively charged cations and negatively charged anions held together by strong electrostatic forces (ionic bonds).\n- They have high melting and boiling points due to the strong ionic bonds.\n- They are generally hard and brittle.\n- In the solid state, they are poor conductors of electricity, but when dissolved in water or melted, they become good conductors due to the mobility of ions.\n\nExample: Sodium chloride (NaCl)\nProperties:\n- High melting point (801°C) and boiling point (1413°C) due to strong ionic bonds.\n- Hard and brittle crystalline structure.\n- Poor conductor of electricity in solid state, but good conductor when dissolved in water or melted.\n\n2. Covalent solids:\nDistinguishing characteristics:\n- Covalent solids consist of atoms held together by strong covalent bonds, which involve the sharing of electrons between atoms.\n- They have high melting and boiling points due to the strong covalent bonds.\n- They are generally hard and brittle (except for certain covalent network solids like graphite, which is soft and slippery).\n- They are poor conductors of electricity and heat.\n\nExample: Diamond (a form of carbon)\nProperties:\n- Extremely high melting point (around 3550°C) due to strong covalent bonds.\n- Hard and brittle crystalline structure, making it one of the hardest known materials.\n- Poor conductor of electricity and heat.\n\n3. Metallic solids:\nDistinguishing characteristics:\n- Metallic solids consist of metal atoms held together by metallic bonds, which involve a \"sea\" of delocalized electrons surrounding positively charged metal ions.\n- They have moderate to high melting and boiling points, depending on the strength of the metallic bonds.\n- They are generally malleable and ductile.\n- They are good conductors of electricity and heat due to the mobility of the delocalized electrons.\n\nExample: Copper (Cu)\nProperties:\n- Moderate melting point (1085°C) and boiling point (2562°C) due to metallic bonds.\n- Malleable and ductile, allowing it to be drawn into wires and hammered into sheets.\n- Good conductor of electricity and heat due to the delocalized electrons."
