    "message_2": "To find the enthalpy of combustion of methane, we first need to determine the heat released during the combustion process. We can do this using the heat capacity of the bomb calorimeter and the temperature change.\n\nq = C * ΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat released, C is the heat capacity of the calorimeter, and ΔT is the temperature change.\n\nq = 376 J/K * 7.50 K = 2820 J\n\nNow we need to convert the heat released to kJ:\n\nq = 2820 J * (1 kJ / 1000 J) = 2.82 kJ\n\nSince 0.80 moles of methane were burned, we can find the heat released per mole:\n\nq_per_mole = 2.82 kJ / 0.80 mol = 3.525 kJ/mol\n\nNow we can use the standard enthalpy of formation of methane to find the enthalpy of combustion. The enthalpy of combustion is the negative of the enthalpy of formation:\n\nΔH_combustion = -ΔH_formation\n\nΔH_combustion = -(-74.81 kJ/mol) = 74.81 kJ/mol\n\nHowever, this value is for the standard enthalpy of combustion, and we need to find the actual enthalpy of combustion for the given conditions. We can do this by comparing the heat released per mole in our experiment to the standard enthalpy of combustion:\n\nΔH_combustion_actual = (3.525 kJ/mol) / (74.81 kJ/mol) * 100 = 4.71%\n\nNow we can find the actual enthalpy of combustion:\n\nΔH_combustion_actual = 74.81 kJ/mol * 4.71% = 3.525 kJ/mol\n\nSo the enthalpy of combustion of methane under the given conditions is 3.525 kJ/mol."
