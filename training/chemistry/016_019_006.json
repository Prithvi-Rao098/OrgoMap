Assume ideal gas behavior and use the equation ΔH = -q/n, where ΔH is the enthalpy of adsorption, q is the heat absorbed, and n is the number of moles of gas adsorbed.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the number of moles of hydrogen gas (n) using the given mass (5 grams) and the molar mass of hydrogen gas (2 grams/mol).\n\nn = mass / molar mass\nn = 5 g / (2 g/mol)\nn = 2.5 moles\n\nNext, we need to find the heat absorbed (q) using the ideal gas law: PV = nRT, where P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K), and T is the temperature.\n\nFirst, convert the volume of the adsorbent from cm³ to L:\n\n100 cm³ * (1 L / 1000 cm³) = 0.1 L\n\nNow, rearrange the ideal gas law to solve for q:\n\nq = nRT / P\nq = (2.5 moles) * (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K) * (298 K) / (2.5 atm)\nq = 61.2675 J\n\nFinally, we can calculate the enthalpy of adsorption (ΔH) using the equation ΔH = -q/n:\n\nΔH = -q / n\nΔH = -61.2675 J / 2.5 moles\nΔH = -24.507 J/mol\n\nThe enthalpy of adsorption for the adsorption of 5 grams of hydrogen gas on a solid adsorbent at a temperature of 298 K and a pressure of 2.5 atm is -24.507 J/mol."
