    "message_2": "To calculate the bond dissociation energy for the single bond in methane (CH4), we need to consider the reaction where one C-H bond is broken:\n\nCH4 → CH3 + H\n\nFirst, we need to find the enthalpy change (ΔH) for this reaction. We can use the given data to do this:\n\nΔHºf(CH4) = -74.8 kJ/mol (enthalpy of formation of methane)\nΔHºrxn = -890.4 kJ/mol (enthalpy change for the complete combustion of methane)\n\nThe complete combustion of methane can be represented by the following reaction:\n\nCH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O\n\nNow, we can use Hess's Law to find the enthalpy change for the bond dissociation reaction. Hess's Law states that the enthalpy change for a reaction is the same, regardless of the pathway taken. We can use the following steps:\n\n1. Reverse the formation reaction of methane:\n-CH4 → -C + 4H (ΔH = +74.8 kJ/mol)\n\n2. Add the complete combustion reaction:\nCH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O (ΔH = -890.4 kJ/mol)\n\n3. Add the formation reactions of CO2 and 2H2O:\nC + 2O2 → CO2 (ΔH = -393.5 kJ/mol)\n2H + O2 → 2H2O (ΔH = -571.6 kJ/mol)\n\nNow, we can sum up the reactions and their enthalpy changes:\n\n-CH4 → -C + 4H (ΔH = +74.8 kJ/mol)\nCH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O (ΔH = -890.4 kJ/mol)\nC + 2O2 → CO2 (ΔH = -393.5 kJ/mol)\n2H + O2 → 2H2O (ΔH = -571.6 kJ/mol)\n---------------------------------------------\n3H → 3H2O (ΔH = ?)\n\nNow, we can solve for the enthalpy change of the bond dissociation reaction:\n\nΔH = 74.8 - 890.4 + 393.5 + 571.6\nΔH = -74.8 + 74.8\nΔH = 0 kJ/mol\n\nSince there are 4 C-H bonds in methane, we can divide the enthalpy change by 4 to find the bond dissociation energy for a single C-H bond:\n\nBond dissociation energy = ΔH / 4\nBond dissociation energy = 0 kJ/mol\n\nThe bond dissociation energy for the single bond in methane (CH4) is 0 kJ/mol."
