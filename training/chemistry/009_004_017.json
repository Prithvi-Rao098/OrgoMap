    "message_1": "How much energy is released when two nuclei of deuterium (a heavy isotope of hydrogen) are fused together to form a nucleus of helium? Assume that the total mass of the reactants is 4.03224 atomic mass units (amu) and the mass of a helium nucleus is 4.00260 amu. Also, the speed of light is 2.998 × 10^8 meters per second and 1 atomic mass unit is equal to 1.66 × 10^-27 kg. Solve this problem in joules (J).",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use Einstein's famous equation, E=mc^2, where E is the energy released, m is the mass difference between the reactants and products, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the mass difference between the reactants and products:\n\nMass difference = (Total mass of reactants) - (Mass of helium nucleus)\nMass difference = (4.03224 amu) - (4.00260 amu)\nMass difference = 0.02964 amu\n\nNow, we need to convert this mass difference from atomic mass units to kilograms:\n\nMass difference (kg) = (0.02964 amu) × (1.66 × 10^-27 kg/amu)\nMass difference (kg) = 4.92064 × 10^-29 kg\n\nNow, we can use Einstein's equation to find the energy released:\n\nE = mc^2\nE = (4.92064 × 10^-29 kg) × (2.998 × 10^8 m/s)^2\nE = 4.92064 × 10^-29 kg × 8.98755179 × 10^16 m^2/s^2\n\nE = 4.4209 × 10^-12 J\n\nTherefore, the energy released when two nuclei of deuterium are fused together to form a nucleus of helium is approximately 4.4209 × 10^-12 joules."
