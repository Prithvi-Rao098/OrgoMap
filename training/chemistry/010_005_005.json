    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (K) for the given electrochemical reaction, we first need to determine the standard cell potential (E°) for the reaction. The standard cell potential can be calculated using the standard reduction potentials of the half-cells involved.\n\nThe given half-cell potentials are:\nAg⁺/Ag = +0.80 V\nCu²⁺/Cu = +0.34 V\n\nThe overall reaction is:\nCu(s) + 2Ag⁺(aq) → Cu²⁺(aq) + 2Ag(s)\n\nThis reaction can be broken down into two half-reactions:\n1. Cu(s) → Cu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ (oxidation half-reaction)\n2. 2Ag⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → 2Ag(s) (reduction half-reaction)\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard cell potential (E°) for the overall reaction using the given standard reduction potentials:\nE°(cell) = E°(cathode) - E°(anode)\n\nSince the Cu²⁺/Cu half-cell is being oxidized (anode) and the Ag⁺/Ag half-cell is being reduced (cathode), we have:\nE°(cell) = (+0.80 V) - (+0.34 V) = +0.46 V\n\nNow, we can use the Nernst equation to find the equilibrium constant (K) for the reaction. The Nernst equation is:\n\nE°(cell) = (RT/nF) * ln(K)\n\nWhere:\nE°(cell) = +0.46 V (standard cell potential)\nR = 8.314 J/(mol·K) (gas constant)\nT = 298 K (temperature in Kelvin, 25°C + 273)\nn = 2 (number of electrons transferred in the reaction)\nF = 96485 C/mol (Faraday's constant)\n\nRearranging the Nernst equation to solve for K:\n\nK = exp(nF * E°(cell) / RT)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nK = exp(2 * 96485 * 0.46 / (8.314 * 298))\nK ≈ 1.1 × 10¹²\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (K) for the given electrochemical reaction at 25°C is approximately 1.1 × 10¹²."
