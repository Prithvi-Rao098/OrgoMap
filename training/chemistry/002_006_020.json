    "message_2": "To find the molar mass of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (MgSO4·7H2O), we need to add the molar masses of all the elements present in the compound.\n\n1. Magnesium (Mg): 1 atom × 24.305 g/mol = 24.305 g/mol\n2. Sulfur (S): 1 atom × 32.07 g/mol = 32.07 g/mol\n3. Oxygen (O): 4 atoms × 16.00 g/mol = 64.00 g/mol\n4. Water (H2O): 7 molecules × (2 × 1.008 g/mol for Hydrogen + 16.00 g/mol for Oxygen) = 7 × (2.016 + 16.00) g/mol = 7 × 18.016 g/mol = 126.112 g/mol\n\nNow, add the molar masses of all the elements:\n\n24.305 g/mol (Mg) + 32.07 g/mol (S) + 64.00 g/mol (O) + 126.112 g/mol (7H2O) = 246.487 g/mol\n\nThe molar mass of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (MgSO4·7H2O) is approximately 246.49 g/mol."
