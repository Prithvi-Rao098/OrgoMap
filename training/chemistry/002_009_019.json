    "message_2": "To find the empirical formula, we first need to convert the grams of each element to moles.\n\n1. Convert grams to moles:\nNitrogen: 2.6 g N * (1 mol N / 14.01 g N) = 0.1856 mol N\nOxygen: 7.8 g O * (1 mol O / 16.00 g O) = 0.4875 mol O\n\n2. Divide each value by the smallest number of moles to get the mole ratio:\n0.1856 mol N / 0.1856 = 1\n0.4875 mol O / 0.1856 = 2.63 (approximately 3)\n\nSo, the empirical formula is N1O3 or simply NO3.\n\nNow, let's find the molecular formula using the molar mass given (92 g/mol).\n\n3. Calculate the empirical formula's molar mass:\nN: 1 * 14.01 g/mol = 14.01 g/mol\nO: 3 * 16.00 g/mol = 48.00 g/mol\nEmpirical formula molar mass: 14.01 + 48.00 = 62.01 g/mol\n\n4. Determine the ratio between the molecular formula's molar mass and the empirical formula's molar mass:\n92 g/mol (molecular formula) / 62.01 g/mol (empirical formula) = 1.48 (approximately 1.5)\n\nSince the ratio is approximately 1.5, we can multiply the empirical formula by 1.5 to get the molecular formula. However, since we cannot have half atoms in a molecular formula, we will round it up to the nearest whole number, which is 2.\n\n5. Multiply the empirical formula by the whole number:\nNO3 * 2 = N2O6\n\nSo, the molecular formula of the compound is N2O6."
