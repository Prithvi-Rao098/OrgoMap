    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the complete combustion of 2 moles of propane (C3H8) in the presence of excess oxygen gas (O2), we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the combustion reaction:\n\nC3H8 + 5O2 → 3CO2 + 4H2O\n\nNow, we need to find the standard enthalpy of formation (∆Hf°) for each compound involved in the reaction. The values are as follows (in kJ/mol):\n\n∆Hf° (C3H8) = -103.85\n∆Hf° (O2) = 0 (since O2 is in its standard state)\n∆Hf° (CO2) = -393.5\n∆Hf° (H2O) = -285.8\n\nNext, we can use Hess's Law to calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\n∆H = [3 * ∆Hf° (CO2) + 4 * ∆Hf° (H2O)] - [2 * ∆Hf° (C3H8)]\n\n∆H = [3 * (-393.5) + 4 * (-285.8)] - [2 * (-103.85)]\n\n∆H = (-1180.5 + (-1143.2)) - (-207.7)\n\n∆H = -2323.7 + 207.7\n\n∆H = -2116 kJ/mol\n\nSince we are considering the combustion of 2 moles of propane, we need to multiply the enthalpy change by 2:\n\n∆H (2 moles of C3H8) = -2116 * 2 = -4232 kJ\n\nSo, the enthalpy change for the complete combustion of 2 moles of propane (C3H8) in the presence of excess oxygen gas (O2) is -4232 kJ."
