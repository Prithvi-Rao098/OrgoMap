    "message_2": "To find the empirical formula, we need to convert the percentages to moles and then find the mole ratio of the elements in the compound.\n\n1. Convert the percentages to grams (assuming we have 100 g of the compound):\n- Magnesium (Mg): 12.5 g\n- Nitrogen (N): 10.8 g\n- Oxygen (O): 76.7 g\n\n2. Convert grams to moles using the molar mass of each element:\n- Magnesium (Mg): 12.5 g / (24.31 g/mol) = 0.514 moles\n- Nitrogen (N): 10.8 g / (14.01 g/mol) = 0.771 moles\n- Oxygen (O): 76.7 g / (16.00 g/mol) = 4.794 moles\n\n3. Find the mole ratio by dividing each value by the smallest number of moles:\n- Magnesium (Mg): 0.514 / 0.514 = 1\n- Nitrogen (N): 0.771 / 0.514 = 1.5\n- Oxygen (O): 4.794 / 0.514 = 9.33\n\nSince the mole ratio is not a whole number, we need to multiply the ratio by a small whole number to get the whole number ratio. In this case, we can multiply by 2:\n\n- Magnesium (Mg): 1 * 2 = 2\n- Nitrogen (N): 1.5 * 2 = 3\n- Oxygen (O): 9.33 * 2 = 18.66 ≈ 19 (rounded to the nearest whole number)\n\nSo, the empirical formula of the compound is Mg₂N₃O₁₉."
