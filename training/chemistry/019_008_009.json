    "message_2": "To calculate the standard electrode potential for the given redox reaction, we need to determine the individual half-reactions and then combine them.\n\nThe given standard reduction potentials are:\nFe²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Fe(s)    E° = -0.44 V\nAl³⁺(aq) + 3e⁻ → Al(s)    E° = -1.66 V\n\nWe need to reverse the second half-reaction to make it an oxidation reaction:\nAl(s) → Al³⁺(aq) + 3e⁻    E° = +1.66 V\n\nNow, we need to balance the electrons in both half-reactions. In this case, we need to multiply the first half-reaction by 3 and the second half-reaction by 2 to get 6 electrons in both reactions:\n\n3[Fe²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Fe(s)]    3E° = 3(-0.44 V)\n2[Al(s) → Al³⁺(aq) + 3e⁻]    2E° = 2(+1.66 V)\n\nNow, we can add the two balanced half-reactions together:\n2Al(s) + 3Fe²⁺(aq) → 3Fe(s) + 2Al³⁺(aq)\n\nFinally, we can calculate the standard electrode potential for the overall redox reaction by adding the potentials of the two half-reactions:\n\nE°(cell) = E°(oxidation) + E°(reduction)\nE°(cell) = 2(+1.66 V) + 3(-0.44 V)\nE°(cell) = 3.32 V - 1.32 V\nE°(cell) = 2.00 V\n\nSo, the standard electrode potential for the given redox reaction is 2.00 V at 298 K."
