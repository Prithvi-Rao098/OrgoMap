    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction, we need to first determine the heat released or absorbed during the reaction (q) and then divide it by the moles of the limiting reactant.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction between sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is:\n\nH2SO4 + 2 NaOH → Na2SO4 + 2 H2O\n\nFirst, we need to determine the limiting reactant. We can do this by calculating the moles of each reactant:\n\nmoles of H2SO4 = volume × concentration = 50 mL × 1 M = 50 mmol\nmoles of NaOH = volume × concentration = 40 mL × 1.5 M = 60 mmol\n\nSince 1 mole of H2SO4 reacts with 2 moles of NaOH, we can see that H2SO4 is the limiting reactant because:\n\n50 mmol H2SO4 × (2 moles NaOH / 1 mole H2SO4) = 100 mmol NaOH required\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat released or absorbed during the reaction (q) using the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere m is the mass of the solution, c is the specific heat capacity of the solution (assuming it's similar to water, which is 4.18 J/g·°C), and ΔT is the temperature change.\n\nThe total volume of the solution is 50 mL + 40 mL = 90 mL, and assuming a density of 1 g/mL (similar to water), the mass of the solution is 90 g.\n\nq = (90 g) × (4.18 J/g·°C) × (6.5 °C) = 2449.7 J\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard enthalpy change (ΔH) by dividing the heat released or absorbed (q) by the moles of the limiting reactant (H2SO4):\n\nΔH = q / moles of limiting reactant = 2449.7 J / 50 mmol = 49.0 J/mmol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change for the reaction between 50 mL of 1 M sulfuric acid and 40 mL of 1.5 M sodium hydroxide at 25 °C, given that the temperature change observed was 6.5 °C, is approximately 49.0 J/mmol."
