    "message_2": "The standard enthalpy change of combustion for methane (CH4) gas at 298K and 1 atm pressure is approximately -890 kJ/mol. This value represents the amount of heat released when one mole of methane is completely combusted in excess oxygen under standard conditions (298K and 1 atm pressure)."
