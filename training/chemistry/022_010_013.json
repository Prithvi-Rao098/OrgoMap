    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of stoichiometry. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction between silver chloride (AgCl) and sodium nitrate (NaNO3) is:\n\nAgCl + NaNO3 → AgNO3 + NaCl\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of AgCl reacts with 1 mole of NaNO3 to produce 1 mole of AgNO3 and 1 mole of NaCl. \n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of AgCl in 5.00 grams. The molar mass of AgCl is:\n\nAg = 107.87 g/mol\nCl = 35.45 g/mol\nAgCl = 107.87 + 35.45 = 143.32 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the moles of AgCl:\n\nmoles of AgCl = mass of AgCl / molar mass of AgCl\nmoles of AgCl = 5.00 g / 143.32 g/mol = 0.0349 mol\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, the moles of NaCl produced will be equal to the moles of AgCl reacted:\n\nmoles of NaCl = 0.0349 mol\n\nNow, we can find the mass of NaCl produced. The molar mass of NaCl is:\n\nNa = 22.99 g/mol\nCl = 35.45 g/mol\nNaCl = 22.99 + 35.45 = 58.44 g/mol\n\nmass of NaCl = moles of NaCl × molar mass of NaCl\nmass of NaCl = 0.0349 mol × 58.44 g/mol = 2.04 g\n\nSo, 2.04 grams of sodium chloride (NaCl) would be produced if 5.00 grams of silver chloride (AgCl) is reacted with an excess of sodium nitrate (NaNO3)."
