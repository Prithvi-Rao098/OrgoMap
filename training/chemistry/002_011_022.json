    "message_2": "The predicted geometry and polarity of the inorganic molecule XeF4 (Xenon hexafluoride) can be determined using the VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) theory.\n\nXenon (Xe) has 8 valence electrons, and each fluorine (F) atom has 7 valence electrons. In XeF4, there are 4 fluorine atoms bonded to the central xenon atom, which contributes 4 electrons to the molecule. Additionally, there are 2 lone pairs of electrons on the xenon atom. Thus, the total number of electron pairs around the central atom is 6 (4 bonding pairs and 2 lone pairs).\n\nAccording to the VSEPR theory, these 6 electron pairs will arrange themselves to minimize repulsion, resulting in an octahedral electron pair geometry. However, since there are only 4 fluorine atoms and 2 lone pairs, the molecular geometry will be square planar.\n\nAs for the polarity of XeF4, the molecule is nonpolar. Although the Xe-F bonds are polar due to the difference in electronegativity between xenon and fluorine, the overall molecular geometry (square planar) causes these bond dipoles to cancel each other out. The molecule has a symmetrical arrangement of the fluorine atoms around the central xenon atom, which results in a net dipole moment of zero. Therefore, XeF4 is a nonpolar molecule."
