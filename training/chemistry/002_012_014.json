    "message_2": "To calculate the bond order of the nitrogen-oxygen bond in the NO molecule, we need to consider the molecular orbital (MO) theory. According to MO theory, bond order is calculated as:\n\nBond order = (number of electrons in bonding MOs - number of electrons in antibonding MOs) / 2\n\nFor the NO molecule, nitrogen has 7 electrons and oxygen has 8 electrons, giving a total of 15 electrons. The molecular orbital configuration for NO is:\n\n1σ² 2σ² 1π² 3σ² 1π*² 2π*¹\n\nHere, the bonding MOs are 1σ, 2σ, 1π, and 3σ, while the antibonding MOs are 1π* and 2π*.\n\nNumber of electrons in bonding MOs = 2 (1σ) + 2 (2σ) + 4 (1π) + 2 (3σ) = 10\nNumber of electrons in antibonding MOs = 4 (1π*) + 1 (2π*) = 5\n\nNow, we can calculate the bond order:\n\nBond order = (10 - 5) / 2 = 2.5\n\nThe bond order of the nitrogen-oxygen bond in the NO molecule is 2.5.\n\nTo estimate the bond length, we can use the bond order and compare it to the known bond lengths of N-N, N=O, and O=O bonds. The bond order of 2.5 is between a double bond (bond order 2) and a triple bond (bond order 3). The bond lengths for N-N, N=O, and O=O are approximately:\n\nN-N (single bond): 1.45 Å\nN=O (double bond): 1.21 Å\nO=O (double bond): 1.21 Å\nN≡N (triple bond): 1.10 Å\nO≡O (triple bond): 1.12 Å\n\nSince the bond order of the nitrogen-oxygen bond in the NO molecule is 2.5, the bond length should be between the double bond and triple bond lengths. We can estimate the bond length to be around 1.15 Å. However, it's important to note that this is just an approximation, and more accurate bond lengths can be obtained through experimental methods or high-level quantum chemistry calculations."
