    "message_1": "What mass of sodium acetate (NaC2H3O2) should be added to 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (HC2H3O2) to prepare a buffer solution with a pH of 4.8? The pKa of acetic acid is 4.76.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log ([A-]/[HA])\n\nwhere pH is the desired pH of the buffer solution, pKa is the acid dissociation constant, [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base (sodium acetate), and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid (acetic acid).\n\nWe are given the pH (4.8), the pKa of acetic acid (4.76), and the initial concentration of acetic acid (0.1 M). We need to find the concentration of sodium acetate ([A-]) to achieve the desired pH.\n\n4.8 = 4.76 + log ([A-]/0.1)\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for [A-]:\n\n[A-] = 0.1 * 10^(4.8 - 4.76)\n\n[A-] = 0.1 * 10^0.04\n\n[A-] ≈ 0.1 * 1.096\n\n[A-] ≈ 0.1096 M\n\nNow that we have the concentration of sodium acetate, we can find the mass of sodium acetate needed. First, we need to find the number of moles of sodium acetate:\n\nmoles of NaC2H3O2 = (0.1096 M) * (0.5 L) = 0.0548 moles\n\nNext, we need to find the molar mass of sodium acetate (NaC2H3O2):\n\nMolar mass of NaC2H3O2 = 22.99 (Na) + 12.01 (C) * 2 + 1.01 (H) * 3 + 16.00 (O) * 2 = 82.03 g/mol\n\nFinally, we can find the mass of sodium acetate needed:\n\nmass of NaC2H3O2 = (0.0548 moles) * (82.03 g/mol) ≈ 4.50 g\n\nSo, approximately 4.50 grams of sodium acetate should be added to 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid to prepare a buffer solution with a pH of 4.8."
