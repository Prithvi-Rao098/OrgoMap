    "message_1": "How will the equilibrium position of the reaction CO(g) + 2H2(g) â‡Œ CH3OH(g) be affected if 0.5 moles of H2 are added to a previously established equilibrium system containing 1 mole of CO, 2 moles of H2, and 0.5 moles of CH3OH?",
    "message_2": "When 0.5 moles of H2 are added to the previously established equilibrium system, the concentration of H2 will increase. According to Le Chatelier's principle, the system will try to counteract this change by shifting the equilibrium position to consume the added H2 and restore equilibrium.\n\nIn this case, the equilibrium will shift to the right, towards the formation of CH3OH. This means that more CH3OH will be produced, and the concentrations of CO and H2 will decrease as they react to form CH3OH. The new equilibrium position will have a higher concentration of CH3OH and lower concentrations of CO and H2 compared to the initial equilibrium state."
