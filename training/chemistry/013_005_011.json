    "message_2": "To determine the specific surface area of activated carbon, we can use the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) equation. The BET equation is used to calculate the surface area of a solid material by analyzing the adsorption of gas molecules onto the surface of the material. In this case, we are given the amount of nitrogen gas adsorbed (100 mg) and the mass of activated carbon (10 g).\n\nThe BET equation is:\n\nN = (N_m * C * P) / [(P_0 - P) * (1 + (C - 1) * P / P_0)]\n\nWhere:\nN = amount of gas adsorbed (in moles)\nN_m = monolayer capacity (in moles)\nC = BET constant\nP = equilibrium pressure of the gas (in atm)\nP_0 = saturation pressure of the gas (in atm)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of nitrogen gas adsorbed to moles. The molecular weight of nitrogen gas (N2) is 28.02 g/mol.\n\n100 mg N2 = 0.1 g N2\n0.1 g N2 * (1 mol N2 / 28.02 g N2) = 0.00357 mol N2\n\nNow we have the amount of nitrogen gas adsorbed (N) in moles, which is 0.00357 mol.\n\nNext, we need to determine the monolayer capacity (N_m). This value represents the amount of gas adsorbed when a complete monolayer is formed on the surface of the material. For activated carbon, a typical value for N_m is 0.15 mol/g.\n\nSince we have 10 g of activated carbon, the monolayer capacity is:\n\nN_m = 0.15 mol/g * 10 g = 1.5 mol\n\nNow we need to determine the BET constant (C). The BET constant is related to the heat of adsorption and is typically in the range of 20-200 for activated carbon. For this problem, we will assume a value of 100 for C.\n\nFinally, we can use the BET equation to calculate the specific surface area of the activated carbon. The surface area (A) can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nA = (N * A_N2) / N_m\n\nWhere:\nA_N2 = cross-sectional area of a nitrogen molecule, which is approximately 0.162 nm²\n\nWe already have the values for N (0.00357 mol) and N_m (1.5 mol). Now we can calculate the specific surface area (A):\n\nA = (0.00357 mol * 0.162 nm²) / 1.5 mol = 0.0003858 nm²\n\nTo convert the surface area to m²/g, we can use the following conversion factor:\n\n1 nm² = 1 × 10⁻¹⁸ m²\n\nA = 0.0003858 nm² * (1 × 10⁻¹⁸ m² / 1 nm²) = 3.858 × 10⁻²¹ m²\n\nSince we have 10 g of activated carbon, the specific surface area per gram is:\n\nA = (3.858 × 10⁻²¹ m²) / 10 g = 3.858 × 10⁻²² m²/g\n\nTherefore, the specific surface area of the activated carbon is approximately 3.858 × 10⁻²² m²/g."
