    "message_2": "The molecular geometry of carbon dioxide (CO2) is linear. In a CO2 molecule, there is one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms. The carbon atom is in the center, and the two oxygen atoms are bonded to it in a straight line. The bond angle between the carbon and the two oxygen atoms is 180 degrees."
