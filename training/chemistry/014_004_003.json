    "message_2": "To determine the crystal field splitting energy (ΔE) for the coordination compound with tetrahedral geometry, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔE = h * c / λ\n\nwhere h is Planck's constant (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J s), c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10¹⁰ cm/s), and λ is the wavelength of the absorption band (600 nm).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the wavelength from nm to cm:\n\n600 nm = 600 x 10⁻⁷ cm\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the equation:\n\nΔE = (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J s) * (2.998 x 10¹⁰ cm/s) / (600 x 10⁻⁷ cm)\n\nΔE = 3.325 x 10⁻¹⁹ J\n\nTo convert the energy from J to cm⁻¹, we can use the following conversion factor:\n\n1 J = 1 / (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J s) * (2.998 x 10¹⁰ cm/s) cm⁻¹\n\nΔE = (3.325 x 10⁻¹⁹ J) * (1 / (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J s) * (2.998 x 10¹⁰ cm/s) cm⁻¹)\n\nΔE ≈ 20000 cm⁻¹\n\nThe crystal field splitting energy for the coordination compound with tetrahedral geometry is approximately 20000 cm⁻¹."
