Given the following enthalpy changes:\n\nC2H5OH (l) + 3 O2 (g) → 2 CO2 (g) + 3 H2O (l)         ΔH° = -1412.8 kJ/mol\n2 H2 (g) + O2 (g) → 2 H2O (l)                               ΔH° = -484.4 kJ/mol \n\nNote: Standard enthalpy of formation data may be required to solve this problem.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change of the oxidation of 2 moles of ethanol, we can use the given enthalpy changes and the Hess's Law. Hess's Law states that the total enthalpy change of a reaction is the same, no matter how many steps it takes, as long as the initial and final conditions are the same.\n\nFirst, let's write down the given reactions:\n\n1) C2H5OH (l) + 3 O2 (g) → 2 CO2 (g) + 3 H2O (l)         ΔH° = -1412.8 kJ/mol\n2) 2 H2 (g) + O2 (g) → 2 H2O (l)                               ΔH° = -484.4 kJ/mol \n\nNow, we need to manipulate these reactions to obtain the desired reaction:\n\nDesired reaction: 2 C2H5OH (l) + 6 O2 (g) → 4 CO2 (g) + 6 H2O (l)\n\nTo obtain the desired reaction, we can multiply the first reaction by 2:\n\n2 * (C2H5OH (l) + 3 O2 (g) → 2 CO2 (g) + 3 H2O (l)) \n2 C2H5OH (l) + 6 O2 (g) → 4 CO2 (g) + 6 H2O (l)         ΔH° = 2 * (-1412.8 kJ/mol) = -2825.6 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we have the desired reaction and its enthalpy change:\n\n2 C2H5OH (l) + 6 O2 (g) → 4 CO2 (g) + 6 H2O (l)         ΔH° = -2825.6 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the enthalpy change of the oxidation of 2 moles of ethanol to form carbon dioxide and water is -2825.6 kJ/mol."
