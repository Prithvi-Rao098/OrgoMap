    "message_2": "To calculate the lattice energy of NaCl, we can use the Born-Lande equation:\n\nLattice Energy (U) = (Madelung constant * charge of cation * charge of anion * electrostatic constant) / (distance between ions)\n\nwhere:\nMadelung constant = 1.748\nCharge of Na+ (cation) = +1 (in elementary charge units)\nCharge of Cl- (anion) = -1 (in elementary charge units)\nElectrostatic constant (k) = 8.9875 × 10^9 N·m^2/C^2\nDistance between ions (r) = 236 pm = 236 × 10^-12 m\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the equation:\n\nU = (1.748 * 1 * -1 * 8.9875 × 10^9 N·m^2/C^2) / (236 × 10^-12 m)\n\nU = (-1.748 * 8.9875 × 10^9 N·m^2/C^2) / (236 × 10^-12 m)\n\nU = -1.571 × 10^10 N·m^2/C^2 / 2.36 × 10^-10 m\n\nU = -6.66 × 10^8 J/C\n\nSince the charges are in elementary charge units, we need to multiply the result by the elementary charge (e) to get the lattice energy in Joules:\n\nElementary charge (e) = 1.602 × 10^-19 C\n\nLattice Energy (U) = -6.66 × 10^8 J/C * 1.602 × 10^-19 C\n\nLattice Energy (U) = -1.067 × 10^-10 J\n\nThe calculated lattice energy of NaCl is approximately -1.067 × 10^-10 Joules."
