    "message_2": "To determine the bond order of carbon dioxide (CO2), we need to first understand its molecular structure. CO2 has a linear structure with a carbon atom double-bonded to two oxygen atoms (O=C=O).\n\nBond order is defined as the number of chemical bonds between a pair of atoms. In CO2, there are two C=O double bonds, which means there are two bonds between the carbon and each oxygen atom.\n\nNow, let's calculate the bond order:\n\nBond order = (Number of bonding electrons - Number of antibonding electrons) / 2\n\nFor CO2, we need to consider the molecular orbital diagram. In the molecular orbital diagram, there are 2σ, 2σ*, 2π, and 2π* orbitals. The σ orbitals are bonding orbitals, while the σ* and π* orbitals are antibonding orbitals.\n\nCarbon has 4 valence electrons, and each oxygen atom has 6 valence electrons. Therefore, there are a total of 16 valence electrons in CO2 (4 from C + 2 * 6 from O).\n\nThe 16 electrons will fill the molecular orbitals in the following order: 2σ (2 electrons), 2σ* (2 electrons), 2π (8 electrons), and 2π* (4 electrons).\n\nNow we can calculate the bond order:\n\nBond order = (Number of bonding electrons - Number of antibonding electrons) / 2\nBond order = (10 - 6) / 2\nBond order = 4 / 2\nBond order = 2\n\nThe bond order of carbon dioxide (CO2) is 2, which is consistent with the double bonds between the carbon and oxygen atoms in the molecule."
