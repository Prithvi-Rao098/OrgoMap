    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the dissolution of 5g of sodium chloride in 100mL of water at 25°C, we first need to determine the number of moles of NaCl being dissolved.\n\nThe molar mass of NaCl is 58.44 g/mol (22.99 g/mol for Na + 35.45 g/mol for Cl).\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of moles of NaCl:\n\nmoles of NaCl = mass / molar mass\nmoles of NaCl = 5g / 58.44 g/mol\nmoles of NaCl ≈ 0.0856 mol\n\nNow that we have the number of moles of NaCl, we can use the molar enthalpy of dissolution to calculate the standard enthalpy change:\n\nΔH = moles of NaCl × molar enthalpy of dissolution\nΔH = 0.0856 mol × (-3.9 kJ/mol)\nΔH ≈ -0.333 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the dissolution of 5g of sodium chloride in 100mL of water at 25°C is approximately -0.333 kJ."
