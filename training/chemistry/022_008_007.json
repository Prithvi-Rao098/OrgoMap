    "message_2": "When copper is placed in a solution of silver nitrate, a single replacement reaction occurs. In this reaction, copper replaces silver in the silver nitrate compound, forming copper nitrate and solid silver. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nCu (s) + 2 AgNO3 (aq) â†’ Cu(NO3)2 (aq) + 2 Ag (s)\n\nThis is a single replacement reaction because one element (copper) is replacing another element (silver) in a compound (silver nitrate). The copper atom essentially \"trades places\" with the silver atom in the compound, resulting in the formation of copper nitrate and solid silver."
