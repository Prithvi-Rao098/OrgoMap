    "message_1": "What mass of copper will be deposited on the cathode during the electrolysis of 200 ml of 0.5 M CuSO4 solution for 30 minutes using a current of 2 amperes? (Given: atomic weight of copper is 63.55 g/mol, Faraday constant = 96,487 Coulombs/mol)",
    "message_2": "To determine the mass of copper deposited on the cathode, we can use Faraday's law of electrolysis. The formula for Faraday's law is:\n\nmass (m) = (current (I) × time (t) × molar mass (M)) / (n × Faraday constant (F))\n\nwhere:\n- I = current (2 amperes)\n- t = time (30 minutes = 1800 seconds)\n- M = molar mass of copper (63.55 g/mol)\n- n = number of electrons transferred per ion (for Cu²⁺, n = 2)\n- F = Faraday constant (96,487 Coulombs/mol)\n\nFirst, we need to find the total charge (Q) passed through the solution:\n\nQ = I × t\nQ = 2 A × 1800 s\nQ = 3600 Coulombs\n\nNext, we can find the number of moles of electrons (ne) that have been transferred:\n\nne = Q / F\nne = 3600 C / 96,487 C/mol\nne = 0.0373 mol\n\nSince the number of moles of electrons is equal to the number of moles of copper deposited (nCu), we can now find the mass of copper deposited:\n\nmass (m) = nCu × M\nm = 0.0373 mol × 63.55 g/mol\nm = 2.37 g\n\nTherefore, 2.37 grams of copper will be deposited on the cathode during the electrolysis of 200 ml of 0.5 M CuSO4 solution for 30 minutes using a current of 2 amperes."
