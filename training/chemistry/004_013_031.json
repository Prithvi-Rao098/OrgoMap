    "message_1": "What is the amount of copper (II) sulfate in a sample of solution if 4.00 coulombs of charge are needed to completely oxidize it at the anode during a coulometric titration? The molarity of the titrant solution is 0.025 M and the volume of the titrant used is 100 mL.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of moles of copper (II) sulfate in the sample and then convert it to grams. We can use the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of moles of electrons transferred during the oxidation process.\n2. Determine the stoichiometry of the redox reaction.\n3. Calculate the number of moles of copper (II) sulfate.\n4. Convert the moles of copper (II) sulfate to grams.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the number of moles of electrons transferred during the oxidation process.\n\nThe number of moles of electrons (n) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nn = Q / (F * z)\n\nwhere Q is the charge in coulombs (4.00 C), F is the Faraday constant (96485 C/mol), and z is the number of electrons transferred in the redox reaction. For the oxidation of copper (II) sulfate, the balanced half-reaction is:\n\nCu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu\n\nSo, z = 2.\n\nn = 4.00 C / (96485 C/mol * 2)\nn = 4.00 C / 192970 C/mol\nn ≈ 0.0000207 mol\n\nStep 2: Determine the stoichiometry of the redox reaction.\n\nThe balanced redox reaction for the titration of copper (II) sulfate with the titrant is:\n\nCu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu\n\nSince 2 moles of electrons are required to reduce 1 mole of Cu²⁺, the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the number of moles of copper (II) sulfate.\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, the number of moles of copper (II) sulfate is equal to the number of moles of electrons:\n\nn(CuSO₄) = n(e⁻) ≈ 0.0000207 mol\n\nStep 4: Convert the moles of copper (II) sulfate to grams.\n\nTo convert the moles of copper (II) sulfate to grams, we can use the molar mass of copper (II) sulfate (CuSO₄), which is approximately 159.61 g/mol:\n\nmass(CuSO₄) = n(CuSO₄) * M(CuSO₄)\nmass(CuSO₄) ≈ 0.0000207 mol * 159.61 g/mol\nmass(CuSO₄) ≈ 0.0033 g\n\nSo, the amount of copper (II) sulfate in the sample of solution is approximately 0.0033 grams."
