    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy of formation of potassium nitrate (KNO3), we need to consider the balanced chemical equation for the formation of KNO3 from its elements in their standard states:\n\nK (s) + 1/2 N2 (g) + 3/2 O2 (g) → KNO3 (s)\n\nNow, we will use Hess's Law, which states that the enthalpy change for a reaction is the same, whether it occurs in one step or several steps. We will use the given information to find the enthalpy change for each step and then sum them up to find the standard enthalpy of formation of KNO3.\n\nStep 1: Combustion of potassium\nK (s) + 1/2 O2 (g) → K2O (s)    ΔH1 = -468 kJ/mol\n\nStep 2: Combustion of nitrogen\n1/2 N2 (g) + 1/2 O2 (g) → NO (g)    ΔH2 = -940 kJ/mol\n\nStep 3: Combustion of oxygen\n3/2 O2 (g) → 3/2 O2 (g)    ΔH3 = -283.8 kJ/mol\n\nStep 4: Formation of KNO3\nK2O (s) + NO (g) + 1/2 O2 (g) → KNO3 (s)    ΔH4 = -383 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can use Hess's Law to find the standard enthalpy of formation of KNO3:\n\nΔHf (KNO3) = ΔH1 + ΔH2 + ΔH3 + ΔH4\nΔHf (KNO3) = -468 kJ/mol + (-940 kJ/mol) + (-283.8 kJ/mol) + (-383 kJ/mol)\nΔHf (KNO3) = -2074.8 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation of potassium nitrate (KNO3) is -2074.8 kJ/mol."
