    "message_2": "To find the activation energy (Ea) for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, we can use the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk = A * e^(-Ea / RT)\n\nwhere k is the rate constant, A is the pre-exponential factor, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol K), T is the temperature in Kelvin, and Ea is the activation energy in J/mol.\n\nWe have two sets of data: k1 = 4.8 x 10^-4 s^-1 at T1 = 298 K and k2 = 7.2 x 10^-3 s^-1 at T2 = 328 K. We can set up two equations using the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk1 = A * e^(-Ea / R * T1)\nk2 = A * e^(-Ea / R * T2)\n\nNow, we can divide the first equation by the second equation to eliminate the pre-exponential factor (A):\n\nk1 / k2 = e^(-Ea / R * T1) / e^(-Ea / R * T2)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n(4.8 x 10^-4) / (7.2 x 10^-3) = e^(Ea * (1 / R * T2 - 1 / R * T1))\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln((4.8 x 10^-4) / (7.2 x 10^-3)) = Ea * (1 / R * T2 - 1 / R * T1)\n\nNow, solve for Ea:\n\nEa = ln((4.8 x 10^-4) / (7.2 x 10^-3)) / (1 / R * T2 - 1 / R * T1)\n\nEa = ln(0.0667) / (1 / (8.314 * 328) - 1 / (8.314 * 298))\n\nEa ≈ -2.708 / (0.000366 - 0.000337)\n\nEa ≈ -2.708 / 0.000029\n\nEa ≈ 93,379 J/mol\n\nThe activation energy required for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen gas is approximately 93,379 J/mol."
