    "message_2": "Ubiquitination is a post-translational modification process that regulates the degradation of proteins in cells. It involves the covalent attachment of a small protein called ubiquitin to target proteins. This process is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis, as it helps in the removal of damaged, misfolded, or unnecessary proteins, and regulates various cellular processes such as cell cycle progression, signal transduction, and gene expression.\n\nThe ubiquitination process involves three main enzymatic steps:\n\n1. Activation: The ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) activates ubiquitin by forming a high-energy thioester bond between the C-terminus of ubiquitin and the active site cysteine of E1. This process requires ATP.\n\n2. Conjugation: The activated ubiquitin is then transferred to a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). The E2 enzyme forms a thioester bond with the activated ubiquitin.\n\n3. Ligation: Finally, a ubiquitin ligase enzyme (E3) recognizes the target protein and facilitates the transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 enzyme to a lysine residue on the target protein. This process can be repeated multiple times, leading to the formation of a polyubiquitin chain on the target protein.\n\nThe role of the proteasome in this process is to recognize and degrade the ubiquitinated proteins. The proteasome is a large, multi-subunit protein complex that acts as the primary proteolytic machinery in eukaryotic cells. It consists of a barrel-shaped core particle (20S proteasome) and one or two regulatory particles (19S proteasome) that cap the ends of the core particle.\n\nThe 19S regulatory particle recognizes the polyubiquitin chain on the target protein and unfolds the protein using ATP-dependent processes. The unfolded protein is then translocated into the 20S core particle, where proteolytic active sites cleave the protein into small peptides. These peptides are released from the proteasome and further degraded into amino acids by cytosolic peptidases.\n\nIn summary, ubiquitination is a crucial process that marks proteins for degradation, and the proteasome plays a central role in recognizing and degrading these ubiquitinated proteins, thereby maintaining cellular protein homeostasis."
