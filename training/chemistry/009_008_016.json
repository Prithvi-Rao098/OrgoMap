    "message_2": "To calculate the efficiency of the gamma-ray detector, we need to find the number of gamma rays emitted by the cesium-137 source and then compare it to the number of counts detected by the detector.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of atoms in the 2 µCi cesium-137 source:\n\nActivity (A) = Specific activity × mass\n2 µCi = 88.0 µCi/g × mass\nmass = 2 µCi / 88.0 µCi/g = 0.0227 g\n\nNow, let's find the number of cesium-137 atoms in the source:\n\nNumber of atoms = mass × (Avogadro's number / molar mass)\nNumber of atoms = 0.0227 g × (6.022 × 10^23 atoms/mol / 137 g/mol)\nNumber of atoms = 1.0 × 10^20 atoms\n\nCesium-137 decays by beta decay, and it emits one gamma photon per decay. So, the number of gamma rays emitted by the source is equal to the number of atoms.\n\nNow, let's find the activity of the source in decays per minute:\n\nActivity (A) = 2 µCi × (3.7 × 10^4 decays/s/µCi) × (60 s/min)\nA = 4.44 × 10^6 decays/min\n\nNow, we can calculate the efficiency of the gamma-ray detector:\n\nEfficiency = (Counts detected / Gamma rays emitted) × 100%\nEfficiency = (8000 counts/min / 4.44 × 10^6 decays/min) × 100%\nEfficiency ≈ 0.18%\n\nThe efficiency of the gamma-ray detector is approximately 0.18%."
