    "message_2": "To find the pH of a solution with a concentration of 0.1 M of hydrochloric acid (HCl), we can use the formula:\n\npH = -log10[H+]\n\nSince HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely in water, releasing one H+ ion for each HCl molecule. Therefore, the concentration of H+ ions in the solution is equal to the concentration of HCl, which is 0.1 M.\n\nNow, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\npH = -log10(0.1)\n\npH = -(-1)\n\npH = 1\n\nSo, the pH of the solution is 1."
