    "message_2": "To determine the oxidation state of sulfur in H2SO4, we can use the oxidation state rules and the concept of balancing charges.\n\n1. The oxidation state of hydrogen (H) is usually +1.\n2. The oxidation state of oxygen (O) is usually -2.\n\nIn H2SO4, there are two hydrogen atoms, one sulfur atom, and four oxygen atoms. Let's assign the oxidation state of sulfur as x.\n\nFor the molecule to be neutral, the sum of the oxidation states of all atoms should be equal to zero.\n\n2(+1) + x + 4(-2) = 0\n\n2 + x - 8 = 0\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nx = 6\n\nSo, the oxidation state of sulfur in H2SO4 is +6."
