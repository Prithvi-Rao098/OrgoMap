    "message_2": "To calculate the mass of aluminum metal deposited, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total charge (in Coulombs) passed through the solution.\n2. Determine the number of moles of electrons involved in the reaction.\n3. Calculate the number of moles of aluminum deposited.\n4. Calculate the mass of aluminum deposited.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total charge\nTotal charge (Q) = Current (I) × Time (t)\nQ = 5.0 A × (45 min × 60 s/min) = 5.0 A × 2700 s = 13,500 C\n\nStep 2: Determine the number of moles of electrons\nMoles of electrons (n) = Total charge (Q) / Faraday constant (F)\nn = 13,500 C / 96,500 C/mol = 0.1399 mol\n\nStep 3: Calculate the number of moles of aluminum deposited\nThe balanced half-reaction for the reduction of aluminum is:\nAl³⁺ + 3e⁻ → Al\nFrom the stoichiometry of the reaction, 3 moles of electrons are required to deposit 1 mole of aluminum.\nMoles of Al = Moles of electrons / 3\nMoles of Al = 0.1399 mol / 3 = 0.0466 mol\n\nStep 4: Calculate the mass of aluminum deposited\nMass of Al = Moles of Al × Molar mass of Al\nMass of Al = 0.0466 mol × 26.98 g/mol = 1.257 g\n\nTherefore, the mass of aluminum metal that can be deposited by passing a current of 5.0 A through an Al(NO3)3 solution for 45 minutes is approximately 1.257 g."
