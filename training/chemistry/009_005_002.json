(Hint: The binding energy can be calculated using the Einstein's famous equation E = mc², where E is energy, m is mass, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum.)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the nuclear binding energy of a helium-4 nucleus, we first need to determine the mass defect. The mass defect is the difference between the combined mass of the individual protons and neutrons and the actual mass of the helium-4 nucleus.\n\nHelium-4 has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. \n\nMass of 2 protons = 2 * 1.0073 u = 2.0146 u\nMass of 2 neutrons = 2 * 1.0087 u = 2.0174 u\nTotal mass of protons and neutrons = 2.0146 u + 2.0174 u = 4.0320 u\n\nNow, we can find the mass defect:\n\nMass defect = Total mass of protons and neutrons - Atomic mass of helium-4\nMass defect = 4.0320 u - 4.0026 u = 0.0294 u\n\nTo convert the mass defect from atomic mass units (u) to kilograms (kg), we use the conversion factor 1 u = 1.66054 × 10^(-27) kg:\n\nMass defect (kg) = 0.0294 u * 1.66054 × 10^(-27) kg/u = 4.8816 × 10^(-29) kg\n\nNow we can use Einstein's equation E = mc² to calculate the binding energy, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum (approximately 3 × 10^8 m/s):\n\nE = (4.8816 × 10^(-29) kg) * (3 × 10^8 m/s)²\nE = 4.8816 × 10^(-29) kg * 9 × 10^16 m²/s²\nE = 4.39344 × 10^(-12) J\n\nTo convert the binding energy from joules (J) to electron volts (eV), we use the conversion factor 1 eV = 1.60218 × 10^(-19) J:\n\nBinding energy (eV) = 4.39344 × 10^(-12) J * (1 eV / 1.60218 × 10^(-19) J)\nBinding energy (eV) ≈ 2.742 × 10^7 eV\n\nSo, the nuclear binding energy of a helium-4 nucleus is approximately 2.742 × 10^7 electron volts (eV)."
