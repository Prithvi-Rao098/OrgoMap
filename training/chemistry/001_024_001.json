    "message_2": "To identify the functional groups present in an unknown organic compound using infrared (IR) spectroscopy, you need to analyze the IR spectra of the compound. The IR spectra display the absorption of infrared radiation by the compound, which corresponds to the vibrations of the bonds within the molecule. Different functional groups have characteristic absorption bands that can be used to identify them.\n\nHere are the general steps to interpret the IR spectra:\n\n1. Obtain the IR spectra of the unknown compound.\n2. Examine the spectra and identify the significant absorption bands.\n3. Compare the absorption bands with the known characteristic bands of various functional groups.\n4. Determine the functional groups present in the compound based on the matching absorption bands.\n\nHere are some common functional groups and their characteristic IR absorption bands:\n\n- O-H (alcohol): Broad absorption around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹\n- O-H (carboxylic acid): Broad absorption around 2500-3300 cm⁻¹, often with a sharp C=O peak around 1700 cm⁻¹\n- N-H (amine): Medium to broad absorption around 3300-3500 cm⁻¹ (primary amines show two peaks, while secondary amines show one peak)\n- C-H (alkane): Absorption around 2850-3000 cm⁻¹\n- C=C (alkene): Absorption around 1600-1680 cm⁻¹\n- C=O (carbonyl group): Sharp absorption around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹\n- C≡C (alkyne): Absorption around 2100-2260 cm⁻¹\n- C≡N (nitrile): Absorption around 2210-2260 cm⁻¹\n- C-N (amine): Absorption around 1000-1250 cm⁻¹\n\nKeep in mind that these values are approximate and can vary depending on the specific compound and the presence of other functional groups. Additionally, some functional groups may not show strong absorption bands, so it's essential to consider the entire spectra and the context of the compound when interpreting the IR spectra.\n\nBy following these steps and comparing the absorption bands in the IR spectra to the characteristic bands of known functional groups, you can identify the functional groups present in the unknown organic compound."
