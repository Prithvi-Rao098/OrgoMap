    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log ([A-]/[HA])\n\nWe are given the pH (7.5), pKa (4.5), and initial concentration of HA (0.2 M). We need to find the concentrations of A- and HA in the final buffer solution.\n\n7.5 = 4.5 + log ([A-]/[HA])\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for the ratio of [A-]/[HA]:\n\nlog ([A-]/[HA]) = 7.5 - 4.5\nlog ([A-]/[HA]) = 3\n\nNow, we can remove the log:\n\n[A-]/[HA] = 10^3\n[A-] = 1000 * [HA]\n\nSince the total volume of the buffer solution is 500 mL, we can write the following equations for the moles of A- and HA:\n\nmoles of A- = 1000 * moles of HA\n\nNow, we need to find the total moles of HA and A- in the 500 mL buffer solution. We know that the initial concentration of HA is 0.2 M, so:\n\nmoles of HA = 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles\n\nNow we can find the moles of A-:\n\nmoles of A- = 1000 * moles of HA = 1000 * 0.1 = 100 moles\n\nNow that we have the moles of A- and HA, we can find the mass of each component. To do this, we need the molar mass of HA and A-. However, since the problem does not provide the molar mass of HA and A-, we will express the mass in terms of their molar masses:\n\nmass of HA = moles of HA * molar mass of HA = 0.1 moles * M_HA\nmass of A- = moles of A- * molar mass of A- = 100 moles * M_A-\n\nSo, to prepare 500 mL of a buffer solution with a pH of 7.5 using a weak acid HA and its conjugate base A-, you would need to mix 0.1 moles * M_HA of HA and 100 moles * M_A- of A-."
