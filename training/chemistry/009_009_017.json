    "message_2": "The nuclear fuel used in commercial nuclear reactors is typically uranium, specifically uranium-235 (U-235) or uranium-238 (U-238) isotopes, which are often enriched to increase the concentration of U-235. In some cases, plutonium-239 (Pu-239) can also be used as a nuclear fuel.\n\nThe energy production in the form of heat occurs through a process called nuclear fission. In this process, the nucleus of a heavy atom, such as uranium-235, absorbs a neutron and becomes unstable. This instability causes the nucleus to split into two smaller nuclei, releasing a large amount of energy in the form of heat, as well as additional neutrons. These released neutrons can then be absorbed by other uranium nuclei, causing a chain reaction of fission events.\n\nThe heat generated by the fission process is used to heat water, which turns into steam. The steam drives turbines, which are connected to generators that produce electricity. This is the basic principle behind the operation of commercial nuclear reactors."
