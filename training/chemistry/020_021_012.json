    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (K) for the redox reaction, we first need to determine the standard cell potential (E°cell) for the reaction. \n\nThe given half-reactions are:\n\nFe3+(aq) + e- → Fe2+(aq)    E° = 0.77 V (Reduction)\n\nI2(s) + 2e- → 2I-(aq)   E° = 0.54 V (Reduction)\n\nWe need to reverse the second half-reaction to make it an oxidation reaction:\n\n2I-(aq) → I2(s) + 2e-   E° = -0.54 V (Oxidation)\n\nNow, we can add the two half-reactions to obtain the overall redox reaction:\n\n2Fe3+(aq) + 2I-(aq) ⇌ 2Fe2+(aq) + I2(s)\n\nNext, we can calculate the standard cell potential (E°cell) by adding the standard reduction potential of the two half-reactions:\n\nE°cell = E°(reduction) + E°(oxidation) = 0.77 V + (-0.54 V) = 0.23 V\n\nNow, we can use the Nernst equation to find the equilibrium constant (K):\n\nE°cell = (RT/nF) * ln(K)\n\nWhere:\nR = 8.314 J/(mol·K) (gas constant)\nT = 298 K (temperature)\nn = 2 (number of electrons transferred in the balanced redox reaction)\nF = 96,485 C/mol (Faraday's constant)\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for K:\n\nK = exp(nFE°cell/RT)\n\nK = exp(2 * 96,485 C/mol * 0.23 V / (8.314 J/(mol·K) * 298 K))\n\nK ≈ 1.1 x 10^4\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (K) for the given redox reaction at 298K is approximately 1.1 x 10^4."
