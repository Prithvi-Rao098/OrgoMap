    "message_2": "There are actually more than three types of chemical reactions, but I will provide examples for three common types: synthesis, decomposition, and displacement reactions.\n\n1. Synthesis (Combination) Reaction: In a synthesis reaction, two or more reactants combine to form a single product. The general form of a synthesis reaction is A + B → AB.\n\nExample: The formation of water from hydrogen and oxygen gases.\n2H₂(g) + O₂(g) → 2H₂O(l)\n\n2. Decomposition Reaction: In a decomposition reaction, a single compound breaks down into two or more simpler substances. The general form of a decomposition reaction is AB → A + B.\n\nExample: The decomposition of potassium chlorate into potassium chloride and oxygen gas.\n2KClO₃(s) → 2KCl(s) + 3O₂(g)\n\n3. Displacement (Single Replacement) Reaction: In a displacement reaction, one element in a compound is replaced by another element. The general form of a displacement reaction is A + BC → AC + B.\n\nExample: The reaction between zinc and hydrochloric acid, where zinc replaces hydrogen in the acid to form zinc chloride and hydrogen gas.\nZn(s) + 2HCl(aq) → ZnCl₂(aq) + H₂(g)\n\nThere are other types of reactions as well, such as double displacement, acid-base, and redox reactions, but these three examples should give you a good starting point."
