    "message_2": "To find the percent composition of potassium nitrate (KNO3), we need to determine the molar mass of each element in the compound and then find the percentage of each element's mass relative to the total molar mass of the compound.\n\nFirst, let's find the molar mass of each element in KNO3:\n1. Potassium (K): 1 atom × 39.10 g/mol (molar mass of K) = 39.10 g/mol\n2. Nitrogen (N): 1 atom × 14.01 g/mol (molar mass of N) = 14.01 g/mol\n3. Oxygen (O): 3 atoms × 16.00 g/mol (molar mass of O) = 48.00 g/mol\n\nNow, let's find the total molar mass of KNO3:\nTotal molar mass = 39.10 g/mol (K) + 14.01 g/mol (N) + 48.00 g/mol (O) = 101.11 g/mol\n\nNext, we'll find the percent composition of each element in KNO3:\n1. Percent composition of Potassium (K): (39.10 g/mol ÷ 101.11 g/mol) × 100% = 38.67%\n2. Percent composition of Nitrogen (N): (14.01 g/mol ÷ 101.11 g/mol) × 100% = 13.85%\n3. Percent composition of Oxygen (O): (48.00 g/mol ÷ 101.11 g/mol) × 100% = 47.48%\n\nSo, the percent composition of potassium nitrate (KNO3) is:\n- Potassium (K): 38.67%\n- Nitrogen (N): 13.85%\n- Oxygen (O): 47.48%"
