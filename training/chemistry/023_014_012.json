    "message_2": "To prepare 4-bromoacetanilide from acetanilide and bromine and obtain the highest yield possible, follow these steps:\n\n1. Dissolve a known quantity of acetanilide in glacial acetic acid. The acetic acid acts as a solvent and a catalyst for the reaction.\n\n2. Cool the solution in an ice bath to minimize side reactions and control the temperature.\n\n3. Slowly add a stoichiometric amount of bromine dissolved in glacial acetic acid to the acetanilide solution while stirring. The bromine reacts with the acetanilide to form 4-bromoacetanilide.\n\n4. Continue stirring the reaction mixture for about 30 minutes to ensure complete reaction.\n\n5. Pour the reaction mixture into crushed ice to precipitate the crude 4-bromoacetanilide product. The product may be contaminated with unreacted starting materials and other side products.\n\n6. Filter the crude product using vacuum filtration and wash it with cold water to remove any remaining acetic acid.\n\n7. To purify the 4-bromoacetanilide, perform a recrystallization. Dissolve the crude product in a minimal amount of hot ethanol or a suitable solvent. Allow the solution to cool slowly to room temperature and then place it in an ice bath to promote crystal formation.\n\n8. Filter the recrystallized product using vacuum filtration and allow it to dry.\n\n9. Determine the yield and purity of the 4-bromoacetanilide by calculating the percentage yield based on the starting amount of acetanilide and analyzing the product using melting point determination and/or thin-layer chromatography (TLC).\n\nBy following this procedure, you can prepare 4-bromoacetanilide from acetanilide and bromine with a high yield and purity."
