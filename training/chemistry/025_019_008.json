    "message_2": "To address the insufficient emphasis on environmental chemistry in chemical education and promote awareness and understanding of the impact of chemical substances on the environment, several strategies can be implemented:\n\n1. Curriculum revision: Integrate environmental chemistry topics into the existing chemistry curriculum at all educational levels, from primary school to university. This can be done by incorporating environmental chemistry modules, case studies, and real-world examples into the teaching materials.\n\n2. Teacher training: Provide training and resources for educators to help them effectively teach environmental chemistry concepts and their applications. This can include workshops, seminars, and online resources that focus on the latest research and developments in the field.\n\n3. Interdisciplinary approach: Encourage collaboration between chemistry, biology, earth science, and other related disciplines to provide a holistic understanding of environmental issues. This can be achieved by organizing joint lectures, seminars, and projects that involve students and faculty from different departments.\n\n4. Hands-on learning: Incorporate laboratory experiments, field trips, and research projects that focus on environmental chemistry topics. This will allow students to gain practical experience and see the real-world implications of their studies.\n\n5. Community outreach: Engage with local communities, industries, and government agencies to raise awareness about environmental chemistry and its importance. This can be done through public lectures, workshops, and collaborative projects that address local environmental issues.\n\n6. Competitions and awards: Organize competitions, such as essay contests, poster presentations, and research projects, that focus on environmental chemistry topics. This will encourage students to explore these issues further and showcase their work to a wider audience.\n\n7. International collaboration: Establish partnerships with educational institutions, research centers, and organizations from around the world to exchange knowledge, resources, and expertise in environmental chemistry. This can help promote global awareness and understanding of the impact of chemical substances on the environment.\n\n8. Media and communication: Utilize various media platforms, such as social media, websites, and newsletters, to share information about environmental chemistry and its relevance to society. This can help raise public awareness and interest in the subject.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, we can address the insufficient emphasis on environmental chemistry in chemical education and promote awareness and understanding of the impact of chemical substances on the environment. This will ultimately contribute to the development of more environmentally conscious citizens and professionals who can work towards a sustainable future."
