    "message_2": "To calculate the cell potential at standard conditions, we need to use the standard reduction potentials for the half-reactions involved. The half-reactions are:\n\nCu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Cu(s)  E° = +0.34 V (reduction)\nAg⁺(aq) + e⁻ → Ag(s)  E° = +0.80 V (reduction)\n\nSince Cu is being oxidized, we need to reverse the first half-reaction:\n\nCu(s) → Cu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻  E° = -0.34 V (oxidation)\n\nNow, we can add the two half-reactions together:\n\nCu(s) + 2 Ag⁺(aq) → Cu²⁺(aq) + 2 Ag(s)\n\nTo find the overall cell potential, we can add the standard potentials of the two half-reactions:\n\nE°(cell) = E°(oxidation) + E°(reduction)\nE°(cell) = -0.34 V + 0.80 V\nE°(cell) = +0.46 V\n\nSo, the cell potential at standard conditions for this reaction is +0.46 V."
