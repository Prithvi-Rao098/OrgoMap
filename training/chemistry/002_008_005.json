    "message_2": "To find the percent composition of sodium chloride (NaCl), we need to determine the mass of each element (sodium and chlorine) and then divide it by the total mass of the compound.\n\nFirst, we need to find the molar mass of each element:\n- Sodium (Na): 22.99 g/mol\n- Chlorine (Cl): 35.45 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the molar mass of NaCl by adding the molar masses of sodium and chlorine:\nMolar mass of NaCl = 22.99 g/mol (Na) + 35.45 g/mol (Cl) = 58.44 g/mol\n\nNext, we will find the percent composition of each element in NaCl:\n\nPercent composition of sodium (Na):\n(22.99 g/mol Na) / (58.44 g/mol NaCl) * 100% = 39.34%\n\nPercent composition of chlorine (Cl):\n(35.45 g/mol Cl) / (58.44 g/mol NaCl) * 100% = 60.66%\n\nSo, the percent composition of sodium chloride (NaCl) is approximately 39.34% sodium (Na) and 60.66% chlorine (Cl)."
