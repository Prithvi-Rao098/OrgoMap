    "message_2": "The optimum ratio of aniline to nitric acid for the preparation of p-nitroaniline in the chemical synthesis process is 1:1. This is because the reaction between aniline (C6H5NH2) and nitric acid (HNO3) is a one-to-one reaction, as shown in the balanced chemical equation:\n\nC6H5NH2 + HNO3 â†’ C6H5N(NO2)H + H2O\n\nIn this reaction, one mole of aniline reacts with one mole of nitric acid to produce one mole of p-nitroaniline and one mole of water. To achieve the highest yield and minimize side reactions, it is essential to maintain a 1:1 molar ratio of aniline to nitric acid."
