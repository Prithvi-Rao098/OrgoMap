The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\n2C4H10(g) + 13O2(g) → 8CO2(g) + 10H2O(l)\n\nGiven that the enthalpy of formation of CO2 is -393.5 kJ/mol, the enthalpy of formation of H2O is -285.8 kJ/mol, and the molar mass of butane is 58.12 g/mol, calculate the enthalpy change (in kJ) for the reaction.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the moles of butane (C4H10) in the 5.00 grams sample:\n\nmoles of butane = mass of butane / molar mass of butane\nmoles of butane = 5.00 g / 58.12 g/mol\nmoles of butane = 0.0860 mol\n\nNow, we need to find the moles of CO2 and H2O produced in the reaction. According to the balanced chemical equation, 2 moles of butane react to produce 8 moles of CO2 and 10 moles of H2O. Therefore, we can use the stoichiometry of the reaction to find the moles of CO2 and H2O produced:\n\nmoles of CO2 = (8 moles CO2 / 2 moles C4H10) × 0.0860 mol C4H10\nmoles of CO2 = 4 × 0.0860 mol\nmoles of CO2 = 0.344 mol\n\nmoles of H2O = (10 moles H2O / 2 moles C4H10) × 0.0860 mol C4H10\nmoles of H2O = 5 × 0.0860 mol\nmoles of H2O = 0.430 mol\n\nNow, we can use the enthalpy of formation values to calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nΔH = [moles of CO2 × ΔHf(CO2)] + [moles of H2O × ΔHf(H2O)] - [moles of C4H10 × ΔHf(C4H10)]\n\nSince the enthalpy of formation of elements in their standard state is zero, ΔHf(C4H10) = ΔHf(O2) = 0. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\nΔH = [moles of CO2 × ΔHf(CO2)] + [moles of H2O × ΔHf(H2O)]\n\nΔH = (0.344 mol × -393.5 kJ/mol) + (0.430 mol × -285.8 kJ/mol)\nΔH = (-135.3 kJ) + (-122.9 kJ)\nΔH = -258.2 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change for the reaction of burning 5.00 grams of butane in oxygen gas is -258.2 kJ."
