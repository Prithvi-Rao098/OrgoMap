Which species will be reduced at the cathode? Which electrode is the anode? Justify your choices using the given standard reduction potentials.",
    "message_2": "To determine the overall cell potential (Ecell) under standard conditions, we need to identify which half-cell reaction will act as the reduction (cathode) and which will act as the oxidation (anode). The species with the higher standard reduction potential (E°) will be reduced, while the species with the lower standard reduction potential will be oxidized.\n\nIn this case, Fe3+ has a higher standard reduction potential (+0.771 V) than Cd2+ (-0.403 V). Therefore, Fe3+ will be reduced at the cathode, and Cd2+ will be oxidized at the anode. The half-cell reactions will be:\n\nCathode (reduction): Fe3+ (aq) + e- → Fe2+ (aq)    E° = +0.771 V\nAnode (oxidation): Cd (s) → Cd2+ (aq) + 2e-    E° = +0.403 V (reverse of the given reaction)\n\nNow, we can calculate the overall cell potential (Ecell) by adding the standard reduction potentials of the two half-cell reactions:\n\nEcell = E°(cathode) - E°(anode)\nEcell = (+0.771 V) - (+0.403 V)\nEcell = +0.368 V\n\nThe overall cell potential under standard conditions is +0.368 V. The species reduced at the cathode is Fe3+, and the electrode acting as the anode is the one where Cd is oxidized to Cd2+."
