    "message_2": "To determine the oxidation state of manganese in potassium permanganate (KMnO4), we will follow the rules employed in electrochemistry.\n\n1. The oxidation state of an element in its elemental form is always 0.\n\n2. The oxidation state of a monatomic ion is equal to its charge.\n\n3. The sum of the oxidation states of all the atoms in a compound must equal the overall charge of the compound.\n\n4. The oxidation state of oxygen is usually -2, except in peroxides (where it is -1) and in compounds with fluorine (where it can be positive).\n\n5. The oxidation state of hydrogen is usually +1 when bonded to nonmetals and -1 when bonded to metals.\n\nNow, let's apply these rules to KMnO4:\n\nPotassium (K) is a monatomic ion with a charge of +1, so its oxidation state is +1.\n\nOxygen (O) has an oxidation state of -2, as it is not in a peroxide or bonded to fluorine.\n\nThe overall charge of the compound KMnO4 is 0, as it is a neutral compound.\n\nLet x be the oxidation state of manganese (Mn).\n\nNow, we can set up an equation using rule 3:\n\n(+1) + x + 4(-2) = 0\n\nSolve for x:\n\n1 + x - 8 = 0\nx - 7 = 0\nx = +7\n\nTherefore, the oxidation state of manganese in potassium permanganate (KMnO4) is +7."
