    "message_1": "A laboratory assistant is asked to prepare a buffer solution with a pH of 7.10 using acetic acid (CH3COOH) and sodium acetate (NaCH3COO). If the laboratory assistant has 250 mL of 0.20 M acetic acid, how many grams of NaCH3COO will be needed to make the buffer solution?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log ([A-]/[HA])\n\nwhere pH is the desired pH of the buffer solution, pKa is the acid dissociation constant for acetic acid, [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base (sodium acetate), and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid (acetic acid).\n\nThe pKa of acetic acid is 4.74. We are given the desired pH (7.10) and the concentration of acetic acid (0.20 M). We can now solve for the concentration of sodium acetate:\n\n7.10 = 4.74 + log ([NaCH3COO]/[CH3COOH])\n2.36 = log ([NaCH3COO]/0.20)\n10^2.36 = [NaCH3COO]/0.20\n229.09 = [NaCH3COO]/0.20\n[NaCH3COO] = 45.82 M\n\nNow, we need to find the number of moles of sodium acetate needed for the 250 mL buffer solution:\n\nmoles of NaCH3COO = Molarity × Volume (in L)\nmoles of NaCH3COO = 45.82 × 0.250\nmoles of NaCH3COO = 11.455\n\nFinally, we need to convert moles of sodium acetate to grams. The molar mass of NaCH3COO is approximately 82.03 g/mol:\n\ngrams of NaCH3COO = moles × molar mass\ngrams of NaCH3COO = 11.455 × 82.03\ngrams of NaCH3COO ≈ 939.56 g\n\nTherefore, the laboratory assistant will need approximately 939.56 grams of sodium acetate to make the buffer solution with a pH of 7.10."
