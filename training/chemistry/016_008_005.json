    "message_2": "To calculate the quantity of heat required to melt 50.0 g of ice at its melting point, we can use the formula:\n\nq = n × ΔHf\n\nwhere q is the heat required, n is the number of moles of ice, and ΔHf is the enthalpy of fusion of water.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the number of moles of ice. The molar mass of water (H₂O) is 18.015 g/mol. So, we can find the number of moles (n) using the formula:\n\nn = mass / molar mass\n\nn = 50.0 g / 18.015 g/mol\nn ≈ 2.776 moles\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat required (q) using the enthalpy of fusion of water (6.01 kJ/mol):\n\nq = n × ΔHf\nq = 2.776 moles × 6.01 kJ/mol\nq ≈ 16.68 kJ\n\nTherefore, the quantity of heat required to melt 50.0 g of ice at its melting point is approximately 16.68 kJ."
