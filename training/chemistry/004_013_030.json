    "message_2": "To determine the amount of silver ions present after the complete electrolysis, we need to first find the number of moles of electrons transferred during the electrolysis process.\n\n1. Calculate the total charge passed during electrolysis:\nCurrent (I) = 2.00 mA = 0.002 A (converting milliamperes to amperes)\nTime (t) = 25.0 minutes = 1500 seconds (converting minutes to seconds)\n\nTotal charge (Q) = Current (I) × Time (t)\nQ = 0.002 A × 1500 s = 3.00 Coulombs\n\n2. Calculate the number of moles of electrons transferred:\n1 mole of electrons = 96,485 Coulombs (Faraday's constant)\n\nMoles of electrons (n) = Total charge (Q) / Faraday's constant\nn = 3.00 C / 96,485 C/mol = 3.11 × 10^(-5) moles\n\n3. Determine the stoichiometry of the reaction:\nThe balanced half-reaction for the reduction of silver ions is:\nAg+ + e- → Ag\n\nFrom the stoichiometry, 1 mole of electrons reduces 1 mole of silver ions.\n\n4. Calculate the moles of silver ions reduced:\nMoles of silver ions reduced = Moles of electrons transferred\nMoles of silver ions reduced = 3.11 × 10^(-5) moles\n\n5. Calculate the initial moles of silver ions in the 50.0 mL of 0.500 M silver nitrate solution:\nInitial moles of silver ions = Molarity × Volume (in liters)\nInitial moles of silver ions = 0.500 mol/L × 0.050 L = 0.025 moles\n\n6. Calculate the moles of silver ions remaining after electrolysis:\nMoles of silver ions remaining = Initial moles - Moles of silver ions reduced\nMoles of silver ions remaining = 0.025 moles - 3.11 × 10^(-5) moles = 0.02497 moles\n\n7. Calculate the amount of silver ions present in the sample after electrolysis:\nAmount of silver ions = Moles of silver ions remaining × Molar mass of silver (Ag)\nAmount of silver ions = 0.02497 moles × 107.87 g/mol = 2.69 g\n\nSo, the amount of silver ions present in the sample after the complete electrolysis of 50.0 mL of 0.500 M silver nitrate solution using coulometric titration at a constant current of 2.00 mA for 25.0 minutes is approximately 2.69 grams."
