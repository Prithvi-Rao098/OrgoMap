    "message_2": "The polarity of a bond is determined by the difference in electronegativity between the two atoms involved in the bond. Electronegativity is a measure of an atom's ability to attract electrons in a chemical bond. The greater the difference in electronegativity, the more polar the bond.\n\nMethane (CH4) is a molecule composed of one carbon atom bonded to four hydrogen atoms. To determine the polarity of the carbon-hydrogen bond in methane, we need to look at the electronegativity values of carbon and hydrogen.\n\nThe electronegativity value for carbon is 2.55, while the electronegativity value for hydrogen is 2.20. The difference in electronegativity between carbon and hydrogen is 2.55 - 2.20 = 0.35.\n\nIn general, a bond is considered polar if the electronegativity difference is greater than 0.5 and nonpolar if the difference is less than 0.5. Since the electronegativity difference between carbon and hydrogen in methane is 0.35, which is less than 0.5, the carbon-hydrogen bond in methane is considered nonpolar.\n\nIt is important to note that the overall methane molecule is also nonpolar. This is because the four carbon-hydrogen bonds are arranged symmetrically around the central carbon atom in a tetrahedral geometry, which results in the cancellation of any small dipole moments that may be present in each individual bond. As a result, methane does not have a net dipole moment and is a nonpolar molecule."
