    "message_2": "For a second-order reaction, the rate law is given by:\n\nrate = k[A]^2\n\nwhere rate is the reaction rate, k is the rate constant, and [A] is the concentration of the reactant.\n\nWe are given the rate (0.025 M/s) and the initial concentration of the reactant (0.10 M). We can now solve for the rate constant (k):\n\n0.025 M/s = k(0.10 M)^2\n\nTo solve for k, divide both sides by (0.10 M)^2:\n\nk = (0.025 M/s) / (0.10 M)^2\n\nk = (0.025 M/s) / (0.01 M^2)\n\nk = 2.5 M^(-1)s^(-1)\n\nSo, the rate constant (k) at 300 K for this gas phase reaction is 2.5 M^(-1)s^(-1)."
