    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of formation for CO2, we need to use the following equation:\n\nΔHf (CO2) = ΔHc (C) + ΔHf (O2) - ΔHf (C(graphite))\n\nHere, ΔHf represents the enthalpy of formation, and ΔHc represents the heat of combustion. The enthalpy of formation for O2 is zero because it is in its standard state.\n\nGiven the heat of combustion for carbon (C) is -393.5 kJ/mol and the enthalpy of formation for graphite (C) is 0 kJ/mol (since it is in its standard state), we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔHf (CO2) = -393.5 kJ/mol + 0 kJ/mol - 0 kJ/mol\n\nΔHf (CO2) = -393.5 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy of formation for carbon dioxide (CO2) under standard conditions is -393.5 kJ/mol."
