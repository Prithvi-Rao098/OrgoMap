    "message_2": "To find the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid, we can use the formula for the dissociation constant (Ka) and the definition of pH. The dissociation of acetic acid can be represented as:\n\nCH3COOH ⇌ CH3COO- + H+\n\nThe Ka expression for this reaction is:\n\nKa = [CH3COO-][H+]/[CH3COOH]\n\nSince the initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.1 M, we can represent the change in concentration as follows:\n\nCH3COOH: 0.1 - x\nCH3COO-: x\nH+: x\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the Ka expression:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 = (x)(x)/(0.1 - x)\n\nAssuming that x is much smaller than 0.1, we can simplify the equation:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 ≈ x^2/0.1\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx^2 = 1.8 x 10^-5 * 0.1\nx^2 = 1.8 x 10^-6\nx ≈ √(1.8 x 10^-6)\nx ≈ 1.34 x 10^-3\n\nSince x represents the concentration of H+ ions, we can now find the pH using the definition of pH:\n\npH = -log10[H+]\npH = -log10(1.34 x 10^-3)\npH ≈ 2.87\n\nTherefore, the pH of the 0.1 M solution of acetic acid is approximately 2.87."
