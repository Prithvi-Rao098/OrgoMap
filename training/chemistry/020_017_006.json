    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (K) for the formation of the complex ion Cu(NH3)4²⁺, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nCu²⁺(aq) + 4NH₃(aq) ⇌ Cu(NH₃)₄²⁺(aq)\n\nNext, we need to determine the initial concentrations of the reactants and products. Since we are given the moles of Cu²⁺ and NH₃ and the volume of the flask, we can calculate the initial concentrations:\n\n[Cu²⁺]₀ = 0.025 mol / 1.00 L = 0.025 M\n[NH₃]₀ = 0.075 mol / 1.00 L = 0.075 M\n[Cu(NH₃)₄²⁺]₀ = 0 (since initially, there is no complex ion formed)\n\nNow, we assume complete complex ion formation, which means all of the Cu²⁺ ions will react with NH₃ to form Cu(NH₃)₄²⁺. We can calculate the final concentrations of the reactants and products:\n\n[Cu²⁺] = 0 (all Cu²⁺ ions have reacted)\n[NH₃] = 0.075 M - 4 × 0.025 M = 0.075 M - 0.100 M = -0.025 M (since the concentration cannot be negative, we assume it to be 0)\n[Cu(NH₃)₄²⁺] = 0.025 M (all Cu²⁺ ions have formed the complex ion)\n\nNow we can write the expression for the equilibrium constant (K):\n\nK = [Cu(NH₃)₄²⁺] / ([Cu²⁺] × [NH₃]⁴)\n\nSince [Cu²⁺] and [NH₃] are both 0, the expression becomes:\n\nK = [Cu(NH₃)₄²⁺] / (0 × 0⁴) = ∞\n\nIn this case, the equilibrium constant is considered to be very large, indicating that the reaction goes to completion and the complex ion formation is highly favored."
