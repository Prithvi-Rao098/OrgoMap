    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use Hess's Law, which states that the total enthalpy change for a reaction is the sum of the enthalpy changes for each step in the reaction. In this case, we can use the standard enthalpies of formation for the reactants and products.\n\nΔH°rxn = Σ ΔH°f (products) - Σ ΔH°f (reactants)\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\nΔH°rxn = [ΔH°f (NaCl) + ΔH°f (H2O)] - [ΔH°f (HCl) + ΔH°f (NaOH)]\n\nΔH°rxn = [(-384.50 kJ/mol) + (-285.83 kJ/mol)] - [(-92.31 kJ/mol) + (-469.14 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH°rxn = (-670.33 kJ/mol) - (-561.45 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH°rxn = -108.88 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the neutralization of hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide to form sodium chloride and water is -108.88 kJ/mol."
