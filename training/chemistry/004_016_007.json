    "message_2": "To determine the concentration of copper ions in a water sample obtained from an abandoned mine using polarographic analysis, you would need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Collect a water sample from the abandoned mine.\n\n2. Prepare the sample by filtering it to remove any suspended particles and then acidifying it with a small amount of concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) to prevent precipitation of metal ions.\n\n3. Prepare a calibration curve by analyzing a series of standard solutions containing known concentrations of copper ions. This can be done by preparing a stock solution of copper sulfate (CuSO4) and diluting it to different concentrations.\n\n4. Perform polarographic analysis on the prepared water sample and the standard solutions. This involves using a polarographic cell, which consists of a dropping mercury electrode (DME) as the working electrode, a reference electrode (usually a saturated calomel electrode), and a counter electrode. The potential is applied between the working and reference electrodes, and the current is measured between the working and counter electrodes.\n\n5. Record the current (in microamperes) at the potential where the copper ions are reduced at the DME. This potential is typically around -0.1 V to -0.2 V versus the saturated calomel electrode.\n\n6. Plot the current values obtained for the standard solutions against their respective copper ion concentrations to create a calibration curve.\n\n7. Determine the concentration of copper ions in the water sample by comparing its current value to the calibration curve. The concentration can be interpolated from the curve or calculated using the equation of the linear regression line.\n\nWithout the actual data from the polarographic analysis, it is impossible to provide a specific concentration value for the copper ions in the water sample. However, by following these steps, you should be able to accurately determine the concentration of copper ions in the sample."
