    "message_2": "To draw the Lewis structure of hydrazine (N2H4), follow these steps:\n\n1. Count the total number of valence electrons in the molecule.\nHydrazine has two nitrogen (N) atoms and four hydrogen (H) atoms. Nitrogen has 5 valence electrons, and hydrogen has 1 valence electron. So, the total number of valence electrons in hydrazine is (2 × 5) + (4 × 1) = 10 + 4 = 14 valence electrons.\n\n2. Determine the central atom(s).\nIn hydrazine, the two nitrogen atoms are bonded together and serve as the central atoms.\n\n3. Connect the central atom(s) to the surrounding atoms with single bonds.\nEach nitrogen atom is connected to two hydrogen atoms. Connect them with single bonds. This will use up 8 valence electrons (4 single bonds × 2 electrons per bond = 8 electrons).\n\n4. Distribute the remaining valence electrons as lone pairs.\nWe have 14 - 8 = 6 valence electrons remaining. Place 3 lone pairs (6 electrons) on each nitrogen atom. Now, each nitrogen atom has an octet (8 electrons).\n\n5. Check the formal charges to ensure the most stable structure.\nThe formal charge on each nitrogen atom is 0, and the formal charge on each hydrogen atom is also 0. The sum of the formal charges is equal to the overall charge of the molecule, which is 0. This indicates that the Lewis structure is stable and correct.\n\nThe Lewis structure of hydrazine (N2H4) is:\n\n      H\n      |\nN - N\n|   |\nH   H"
