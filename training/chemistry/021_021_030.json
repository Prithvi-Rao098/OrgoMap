    "message_2": "In the molecule of methane (CH4), the hybrid orbitals present are sp3 hybrid orbitals. The carbon atom forms four sigma bonds with four hydrogen atoms, and to do so, it undergoes hybridization, combining its 2s orbital with its three 2p orbitals to form four equivalent sp3 hybrid orbitals. These sp3 hybrid orbitals then overlap with the 1s orbitals of the hydrogen atoms to form the four C-H sigma bonds in the tetrahedral structure of methane."
