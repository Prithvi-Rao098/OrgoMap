    "message_2": "In a hydrogen atom, the energy levels are given by the formula:\n\nE_n = -13.6 eV/n^2\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the nth level and n is the principal quantum number.\n\nFor the first excited state (n = 2) and the ground state (n = 1), we can calculate the energy difference (ΔE) between these two levels:\n\nΔE = E_1 - E_2 = (-13.6 eV/1^2) - (-13.6 eV/2^2) = -13.6 eV + 3.4 eV = -10.2 eV\n\nThe energy difference between the first excited state and the ground state is -10.2 eV. The negative sign indicates that energy is released when the electron transitions from the first excited state to the ground state.\n\nTo find the wavelength (λ) of the emitted photon, we can use the equation:\n\nΔE = h * c / λ\n\nwhere h is Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and λ is the wavelength.\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for λ, we get:\n\nλ = h * c / ΔE\n\nFirst, we need to convert the energy difference from electron volts (eV) to joules (J) using the conversion factor 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J:\n\nΔE = -10.2 eV * (1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV) = -1.634 x 10^-18 J\n\nNow, we can calculate the wavelength:\n\nλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (-1.634 x 10^-18 J) ≈ 1.215 x 10^-7 m\n\nThe wavelength of the transition from the first excited state to the ground state of a hydrogen atom is approximately 1.215 x 10^-7 m or 121.5 nm. This falls in the ultraviolet range of the electromagnetic spectrum."
