    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the phase transition of water from ice to liquid at 25°C and 1 atm pressure, we need to consider two steps: \n\n1. Heating the ice from -273.15°C (0 K) to 0°C (273.15 K)\n2. Melting the ice at 0°C (273.15 K)\n\nStep 1: Heating the ice from -273.15°C to 0°C\nThe heat capacity of ice is approximately 2.09 J/g·K. To calculate the enthalpy change for heating the ice, we can use the formula:\n\nΔH = m × C × ΔT\n\nwhere ΔH is the enthalpy change, m is the mass of the substance, C is the heat capacity, and ΔT is the temperature change.\n\nAssuming 1 mole of ice (18.015 g), the enthalpy change for heating the ice is:\n\nΔH1 = (18.015 g) × (2.09 J/g·K) × (273.15 K - 0 K) = 18.015 g × 2.09 J/g·K × 273.15 K ≈ 10,340 J\n\nStep 2: Melting the ice at 0°C\nThe enthalpy of fusion for water (melting ice to liquid) is 6.01 kJ/mol.\n\nΔH2 = 6.01 kJ/mol × 1000 J/kJ = 6010 J\n\nNow, we can add the enthalpy changes for both steps to find the total enthalpy change for the phase transition of water from ice to liquid at 25°C and 1 atm pressure:\n\nΔH_total = ΔH1 + ΔH2 = 10,340 J + 6010 J ≈ 16,350 J\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the phase transition of water from ice to liquid at 25°C and 1 atm pressure is approximately 16,350 J/mol."
