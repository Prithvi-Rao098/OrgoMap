    "message_2": "In the CBr4 molecule, the carbon atom is bonded to four bromine atoms. To form these bonds, the carbon atom undergoes sp3 hybridization. This hybridization involves the mixing of one s orbital and three p orbitals to form four sp3 hybrid orbitals, which are arranged in a tetrahedral geometry around the carbon atom. The hybridization state of the carbon atom in CBr4 is sp3."
