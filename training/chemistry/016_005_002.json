    "message_2": "The enthalpy of combustion of ethanol (C2H5OH) is already given as the standard enthalpy change of combustion, which is -1367 kJ/mol. This value represents the heat released when one mole of ethanol undergoes complete combustion under standard conditions.\n\nThe heat of formation of water (H2O) is not directly relevant to this question, as the enthalpy of combustion of ethanol has already been provided."
