    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy change for the precipitation reaction, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nAgNO3(aq) + HCl(aq) → AgCl(s) + HNO3(aq)\n\nNow, we can use Hess's Law to calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction. Hess's Law states that the enthalpy change for a reaction is equal to the sum of the enthalpy changes for the formation of the products minus the sum of the enthalpy changes for the formation of the reactants.\n\nΔH_reaction = [ΔH_f(AgCl) + ΔH_f(HNO3)] - [ΔH_f(AgNO3) + ΔH_f(HCl)]\n\nWe are given the enthalpy of formation for AgNO3, AgCl, and HCl, but we need to find the enthalpy of formation for HNO3. The standard enthalpy of formation for HNO3 is -174.1 kJ/mol.\n\nNow we can plug in the values:\n\nΔH_reaction = [(-127.0 kJ/mol) + (-174.1 kJ/mol)] - [(-365.3 kJ/mol) + (-92.31 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH_reaction = (-301.1 kJ/mol) - (-457.61 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH_reaction = 156.51 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the precipitation reaction of silver chloride (AgCl) when it is formed from silver nitrate (AgNO3) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) is 156.51 kJ/mol."
