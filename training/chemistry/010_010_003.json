    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question for the student to solve:\n\nA lead-acid battery has an electrode consisting of lead metal while the other electrode is lead dioxide. The electrolyte is 4 M sulfuric acid. If the cell operates until the lead electrode has dropped by 2.50 g, how much charge has passed through the external circuit? The half-reactions for the cell are:\n\nPbSO4(s) + 2 H+(aq) + 2 e- → Pb(s) + H2SO4(aq)\nPbO2(s) + 4 H+(aq) + SO42-(aq) + 2 e- → PbSO4(s) + 2 H2O(l)\n\n(Charge of electron is 1.602 × 10^-19C.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of moles of lead (Pb) that have been consumed and then use the stoichiometry of the half-reactions to determine the number of moles of electrons that have been transferred. Finally, we can calculate the total charge that has passed through the external circuit.\n\n1. Calculate the moles of lead (Pb) consumed:\nPb has a molar mass of 207.2 g/mol. \nmoles of Pb = (mass of Pb) / (molar mass of Pb) = 2.50 g / 207.2 g/mol = 0.0121 mol\n\n2. Determine the moles of electrons transferred:\nFrom the half-reactions, we can see that 2 moles of electrons are transferred for every mole of Pb consumed.\nmoles of electrons = 0.0121 mol Pb * (2 mol e- / 1 mol Pb) = 0.0242 mol e-\n\n3. Calculate the total charge that has passed through the external circuit:\nCharge = (moles of electrons) * (charge of 1 electron)\nCharge = 0.0242 mol e- * (6.022 x 10^23 e-/mol) * (1.602 x 10^-19 C/e-)\nCharge = 2.34 x 10^5 C\n\nSo, the total charge that has passed through the external circuit is 2.34 x 10^5 Coulombs."
