The specific heat capacity of water is 4.18 J/g°C. The molar mass of NaOH is 40.00 g/mol and the enthalpy of dissolution for NaOH is -44.51 kJ/mol.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to calculate the number of moles of NaOH dissolved:\n\nmoles of NaOH = mass of NaOH / molar mass of NaOH\nmoles of NaOH = 10 g / 40.00 g/mol = 0.25 mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the dissolution of 0.25 mol of NaOH:\n\nΔH = moles of NaOH * enthalpy of dissolution per mole\nΔH = 0.25 mol * (-44.51 kJ/mol) = -11.1275 kJ\n\nNext, we need to calculate the heat absorbed by the water:\n\nmass of water = 100 mL * 1 g/mL = 100 g (since the density of water is approximately 1 g/mL)\n\nΔT = final temperature - initial temperature\nΔT = 28°C - 25°C = 3°C\n\nq = mass of water * specific heat capacity of water * ΔT\nq = 100 g * 4.18 J/g°C * 3°C = 1254 J = 1.254 kJ\n\nSince the dissolution of NaOH is exothermic, the heat absorbed by the water is equal to the heat released by the dissolution of NaOH:\n\nΔH = -q\n-11.1275 kJ = -1.254 kJ\n\nHowever, this is not possible, as the enthalpy change for the dissolution of NaOH should be more negative than the heat absorbed by the water. There might be an error in the given data or the final temperature after mixing. Please check the data and try again."
