    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy of formation of methane (ΔHf° of CH4), we can use the given data and the balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane:\n\nCH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(g)\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for this reaction (ΔHc°) is given as -890.3 kJ/mol. We can use Hess's Law to relate the enthalpies of formation of the products and reactants:\n\nΔHc° = [ΔHf°(CO2) + 2 * ΔHf°(H2O)] - [ΔHf°(CH4) + 2 * ΔHf°(O2)]\n\nSince O2 is in its standard state, its enthalpy of formation is 0:\n\nΔHc° = [ΔHf°(CO2) + 2 * ΔHf°(H2O)] - ΔHf°(CH4)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\n-890.3 kJ/mol = [-393.5 kJ/mol + 2 * (-241.8 kJ/mol)] - ΔHf°(CH4)\n\n-890.3 kJ/mol = [-393.5 kJ/mol - 483.6 kJ/mol] - ΔHf°(CH4)\n\n-890.3 kJ/mol = -877.1 kJ/mol - ΔHf°(CH4)\n\nNow, solve for ΔHf°(CH4):\n\nΔHf°(CH4) = -877.1 kJ/mol + 890.3 kJ/mol\n\nΔHf°(CH4) = 13.2 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy of formation of methane (CH4) at 25°C and 1 atm is 13.2 kJ/mol."
