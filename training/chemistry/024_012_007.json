    "message_2": "To design a system with optimal conditions for extracting valuable metals from electronic waste, we need to consider the following steps:\n\n1. Pre-processing: The first step involves the collection, sorting, and dismantling of electronic waste. This process helps in separating valuable components and materials, such as printed circuit boards (PCBs), which contain high concentrations of precious metals.\n\n2. Mechanical processing: The PCBs are then mechanically processed to reduce their size and increase the surface area for further treatment. This can be done through shredding, grinding, or milling.\n\n3. Pyrometallurgical process: The processed PCBs are subjected to high temperatures in a furnace or smelter to separate the metals from non-metallic components. This process can be carried out in different ways, such as incineration, smelting, or calcination. The choice of method depends on the type of electronic waste and the desired end product. The resulting metal-rich slag can be further processed to extract the valuable metals.\n\n4. Hydrometallurgical process: The metal-rich slag is then subjected to a leaching process, where it is treated with suitable chemicals, such as acids or cyanide, to dissolve the metals. The choice of leaching agent depends on the type of metal and the environmental regulations in place. The leaching process can be carried out in a batch or continuous mode, depending on the scale of operation.\n\n5. Metal recovery: The leachate containing the dissolved metals is then subjected to various separation and purification techniques, such as precipitation, solvent extraction, ion exchange, or electro-winning, to recover the valuable metals in their pure form.\n\n6. Waste treatment and disposal: The remaining waste materials, such as non-metallic components and leaching residues, need to be treated and disposed of in an environmentally friendly manner. This can be done through processes like neutralization, solidification, or encapsulation.\n\nTo maximize profitability and minimize environmental impact, the following factors should be considered:\n\n1. Process optimization: Optimize the pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical processes to achieve maximum metal recovery and minimize waste generation. This can be done through process modeling, simulation, and control.\n\n2. Energy efficiency: Implement energy-efficient technologies and practices to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n3. Waste minimization: Adopt waste minimization strategies, such as recycling and reusing process materials, to reduce waste generation and disposal costs.\n\n4. Environmental compliance: Ensure that the extraction processes comply with local and international environmental regulations, such as the Basel Convention and the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) Directive.\n\n5. Technological advancements: Continuously invest in research and development to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the extraction processes.\n\n6. Collaboration: Collaborate with other stakeholders, such as electronic waste recyclers, manufacturers, and government agencies, to promote the sustainable management of electronic waste and the recovery of valuable metals."
