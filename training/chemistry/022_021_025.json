    "message_2": "The equilibrium constant expression for the given reaction is:\n\nKc = [NH3]^2 / ([N2] * [H2]^3)\n\nGiven the equilibrium concentrations of N2, H2, and NH3 are 0.25 M, 0.08 M, and 0.40 M, respectively, we can plug these values into the expression:\n\nKc = (0.40)^2 / (0.25 * (0.08)^3)\n\nKc = 0.16 / (0.25 * 0.000512)\n\nKc = 0.16 / 0.000128\n\nKc ≈ 1250\n\nSo, the numerical value of the equilibrium constant Kc is approximately 1250."
