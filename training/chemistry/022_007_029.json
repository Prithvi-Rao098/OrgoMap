    "message_2": "The decomposition reaction of potassium chlorate (KClO3) can be represented by the following chemical equation:\n\n2 KClO3(s) → 2 KCl(s) + 3 O2(g)\n\nIn this reaction, potassium chlorate breaks down into potassium chloride (KCl) and oxygen gas (O2).\n\nWhen manganese dioxide (MnO2) is used as a catalyst, it speeds up the reaction without being consumed in the process. The chemical equation remains the same, but the reaction occurs more quickly:\n\n2 KClO3(s) + MnO2(catalyst) → 2 KCl(s) + 3 O2(g) + MnO2(catalyst)\n\nThe manganese dioxide is not consumed in the reaction, so it appears on both sides of the equation. Its presence lowers the activation energy and increases the rate of the reaction, making it an effective catalyst for the decomposition of potassium chlorate."
