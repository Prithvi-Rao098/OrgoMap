    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use Hess's Law, which states that the total enthalpy change for a reaction is the sum of the enthalpy changes for each step in the reaction. In this case, we can break the reaction down into the following steps:\n\n1. Formation of cobalt(II) chloride hexahydrate from cobalt(II) chloride and water:\nCoCl2 + 6 H2O → CoCl2•6H2O\nΔH1 = -787 kJ/mol\n\n2. Reaction of cobalt(II) chloride hexahydrate with sodium carbonate to form cobalt(II) carbonate, sodium chloride, and water:\nCoCl2•6H2O + Na2CO3 → CoCO3 + 2 NaCl + 6 H2O\nΔH2 = ?\n\n3. Formation of sodium chloride from sodium and chlorine:\n2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl\nΔH3 = -411 kJ/mol\n\n4. Formation of cobalt(II) carbonate from cobalt and carbon dioxide:\nCo + CO2 → CoCO3\nΔH4 = -718 kJ/mol\n\n5. Formation of sodium carbonate from sodium and carbon dioxide:\n2 Na + CO2 → Na2CO3\nΔH5 = -1130 kJ/mol\n\nNow we can use Hess's Law to find the enthalpy change for the overall reaction (ΔH2):\n\nΔH2 = ΔH1 + ΔH3 + ΔH4 - ΔH5\n\nΔH2 = (-787 kJ/mol) + (-411 kJ/mol) + (-718 kJ/mol) - (-1130 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH2 = -787 - 411 - 718 + 1130\n\nΔH2 = -916 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change for the reaction of cobalt(II) chloride hexahydrate with sodium carbonate to form cobalt(II) carbonate and sodium chloride is -916 kJ/mol."
