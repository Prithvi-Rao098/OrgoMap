    "message_2": "As an AI language model, I cannot perform actual experiments or analyze real data. However, I can guide you through the process of identifying an unknown compound using mass spectrometry.\n\n1. Obtain a mass spectrum of the sample: Run the sample through a mass spectrometer, which will ionize the molecules and separate them based on their mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio. The mass spectrometer will generate a mass spectrum, which is a plot of intensity (abundance) versus m/z values.\n\n2. Identify the molecular ion peak: The molecular ion peak (M+ or [M+H]+) corresponds to the intact molecule with either no charge or a single positive charge. This peak represents the molecular weight of the compound. Look for the peak with the highest m/z value in the mass spectrum, which is usually the molecular ion peak.\n\n3. Determine the molecular formula: Using the molecular weight obtained from the molecular ion peak, you can deduce the molecular formula of the compound. You may need to consider the isotopic patterns in the mass spectrum to confirm the presence of specific elements.\n\n4. Analyze fragmentation patterns: The mass spectrum will also contain peaks corresponding to fragment ions formed by the cleavage of chemical bonds in the molecule. By analyzing these fragmentation patterns, you can gain insights into the structure of the compound.\n\n5. Compare with known compounds: Compare the obtained mass spectrum, molecular formula, and fragmentation patterns with those of known compounds in databases or literature. This will help you narrow down the possible structures and eventually identify the unknown compound.\n\n6. Confirm the structure: Once you have a candidate structure, you may need to use additional analytical techniques, such as infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, or X-ray crystallography, to confirm the structure of the compound.\n\nRemember that the molecular weight of the compound can be obtained directly from the molecular ion peak in the mass spectrum. However, identifying the compound itself requires a thorough analysis of the mass spectrum, comparison with known compounds, and possibly additional analytical techniques."
