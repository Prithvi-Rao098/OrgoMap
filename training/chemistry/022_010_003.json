    "message_2": "First, we need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nAgNO3(aq) + HCl(aq) â†’ AgCl(s) + HNO3(aq)\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that the reaction occurs in a 1:1 ratio between AgNO3 and HCl.\n\nNow, we can calculate the moles of each reactant:\nMoles of AgNO3 = (0.1 M)(0.050 L) = 0.005 moles\nMoles of HCl = (0.2 M)(0.100 L) = 0.020 moles\n\nSince the reaction occurs in a 1:1 ratio, the limiting reactant is AgNO3, as there are fewer moles of it. We will use the moles of AgNO3 to determine the mass of AgCl produced.\n\nMoles of AgCl = moles of AgNO3 = 0.005 moles\n\nNow, we need to find the molar mass of AgCl:\nAgCl = 107.87 g/mol (Ag) + 35.45 g/mol (Cl) = 143.32 g/mol\n\nFinally, we can calculate the mass of AgCl produced:\nMass of AgCl = (0.005 moles)(143.32 g/mol) = 0.717 g\n\nSo, 0.717 grams of AgCl can be produced from the reaction.\n\nNow, let's determine the excess reactant and by how much:\nSince AgNO3 is the limiting reactant, HCl is in excess. We need to find out how many moles of HCl are left after the reaction.\n\nMoles of HCl used = moles of AgNO3 = 0.005 moles\nMoles of HCl remaining = initial moles of HCl - moles of HCl used = 0.020 moles - 0.005 moles = 0.015 moles\n\nThus, HCl is in excess by 0.015 moles."
