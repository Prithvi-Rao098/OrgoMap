    "message_2": "In the compound Na2SO4, the oxidation state of sodium (Na) is +1 and the oxidation state of oxygen (O) is -2. The compound has a neutral charge, so the sum of the oxidation states of all the elements in the compound must equal zero.\n\nLet's denote the oxidation state of sulfur (S) as x. The compound has 2 sodium atoms, 1 sulfur atom, and 4 oxygen atoms. Using the oxidation states, we can set up an equation:\n\n2(+1) + x + 4(-2) = 0\n\nSolving for x:\n\n2 + x - 8 = 0\nx - 6 = 0\nx = +6\n\nThe oxidation state of sulfur in Na2SO4 is +6."
