    "message_2": "The structure of therapeutic drugs plays a crucial role in determining their potential toxicity levels. Several factors contribute to this, including the drug's chemical properties, its interaction with biological targets, and its metabolism within the body.\n\n1. Chemical properties: The drug's chemical structure affects its solubility, stability, and reactivity. Highly reactive drugs can potentially cause toxic side effects by interacting with unintended targets in the body. Additionally, drugs with poor solubility may accumulate in certain tissues, leading to toxicity.\n\n2. Interaction with biological targets: The drug's structure determines its selectivity and affinity for its intended target. A drug with high selectivity will interact primarily with its target, reducing the likelihood of off-target effects and toxicity. However, if a drug has low selectivity, it may interact with multiple targets, increasing the risk of adverse effects.\n\n3. Metabolism: The drug's structure influences how it is metabolized and eliminated from the body. Some drugs may be converted into toxic metabolites, which can cause harm to the body. Additionally, if a drug is not efficiently eliminated, it may accumulate and cause toxicity.\n\nTo decrease toxicity without compromising the effectiveness of medications, several changes can be made to the drug's structure:\n\n1. Improve selectivity: By modifying the drug's structure to increase its selectivity for the intended target, off-target effects can be minimized, reducing the risk of toxicity.\n\n2. Enhance stability and solubility: Adjusting the drug's structure to improve its stability and solubility can prevent accumulation in tissues and reduce the likelihood of toxic side effects.\n\n3. Optimize metabolism: Modifying the drug's structure to promote the formation of non-toxic metabolites and efficient elimination can help decrease the risk of toxicity.\n\n4. Use prodrugs: Prodrugs are inactive compounds that are converted into active drugs within the body. Designing prodrugs with improved safety profiles can help reduce toxicity while maintaining therapeutic effectiveness.\n\n5. Employ targeted drug delivery systems: By using targeted drug delivery systems, such as nanoparticles or antibody-drug conjugates, the drug can be delivered specifically to the intended site of action, reducing the potential for off-target effects and toxicity.\n\nIn conclusion, the structure of therapeutic drugs significantly impacts their potential toxicity levels. By making strategic modifications to the drug's structure, it is possible to decrease toxicity without compromising the drug's effectiveness as a medication."
