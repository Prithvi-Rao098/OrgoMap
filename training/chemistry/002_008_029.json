    "message_2": "To find the percentage composition of magnesium chloride (MgCl2), we need to determine the molar mass of the compound and then find the mass percentage of each element (magnesium and chlorine) in the compound.\n\nStep 1: Determine the molar mass of MgCl2\nThe molar mass of a compound is the sum of the molar masses of its constituent elements. The molar mass of magnesium (Mg) is 24.305 g/mol, and the molar mass of chlorine (Cl) is 35.453 g/mol.\n\nMgCl2 = 1 Mg atom + 2 Cl atoms\nMolar mass of MgCl2 = (1 × 24.305 g/mol) + (2 × 35.453 g/mol)\nMolar mass of MgCl2 = 24.305 g/mol + 70.906 g/mol\nMolar mass of MgCl2 = 95.211 g/mol\n\nStep 2: Calculate the mass percentage of each element\nNow we will find the mass percentage of magnesium and chlorine in MgCl2.\n\nMass percentage of Mg = (molar mass of Mg / molar mass of MgCl2) × 100\nMass percentage of Mg = (24.305 g/mol / 95.211 g/mol) × 100\nMass percentage of Mg ≈ 25.53%\n\nMass percentage of Cl = (molar mass of Cl / molar mass of MgCl2) × 100\nSince there are 2 Cl atoms in MgCl2, we need to multiply the molar mass of Cl by 2.\nMass percentage of Cl = (70.906 g/mol / 95.211 g/mol) × 100\nMass percentage of Cl ≈ 74.47%\n\nThe percentage composition of magnesium chloride (MgCl2) is approximately 25.53% magnesium (Mg) and 74.47% chlorine (Cl)."
