    "message_2": "The coordination geometry of the heme group in myoglobin is an octahedral geometry. The heme group consists of a central iron (Fe) atom, which is coordinated to four nitrogen atoms from the porphyrin ring in a planar arrangement. These four nitrogen atoms occupy the equatorial positions of the octahedron.\n\nThe fifth coordination site (axial position) is occupied by a nitrogen atom from a histidine residue (called the proximal histidine) of the myoglobin protein. This histidine residue is essential for anchoring the heme group to the protein and maintaining its stability.\n\nThe sixth coordination site (the other axial position) is available for binding to small ligands, such as oxygen (O2), carbon monoxide (CO), or nitric oxide (NO). In the case of myoglobin, its primary function is to bind and store oxygen in muscle tissues, so the sixth coordination site is typically occupied by an oxygen molecule.\n\nThe octahedral coordination geometry of the heme group in myoglobin plays a crucial role in its function as an oxygen carrier. The geometry allows for selective binding of oxygen while minimizing the binding of other small molecules that could interfere with its function. When oxygen binds to the iron atom, it causes a slight change in the geometry, which leads to a conformational change in the protein structure. This change allows myoglobin to have a higher affinity for oxygen, enabling it to effectively pick up oxygen from the bloodstream and store it in muscle tissues for later use during periods of increased oxygen demand, such as during physical activity.\n\nIn summary, the octahedral coordination geometry of the heme group in myoglobin is essential for its function as an oxygen carrier, as it allows for selective binding and storage of oxygen while minimizing the binding of other potentially harmful molecules."
