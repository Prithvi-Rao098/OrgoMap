    "message_2": "In the compound H2SO4 (sulfuric acid), the oxidation state of sulfur can be determined by considering the oxidation states of the other elements in the compound and the overall charge of the molecule.\n\nThe oxidation state of hydrogen (H) is +1, and there are two hydrogen atoms, so the total oxidation state for hydrogen is +2.\n\nThe oxidation state of oxygen (O) is -2, and there are four oxygen atoms, so the total oxidation state for oxygen is -8.\n\nSince the overall charge of the molecule is neutral (0), the oxidation state of sulfur (S) can be calculated as follows:\n\nOxidation state of S + (+2) + (-8) = 0\n\nOxidation state of S - 6 = 0\n\nOxidation state of S = +6\n\nSo, the oxidation state of sulfur in H2SO4 is +6."
