    "message_2": "To calculate the BET surface area of the activated carbon, we can use the BET equation:\n\nBET surface area (S_BET) = (V_m * N_A * A_m) / (M)\n\nwhere:\n- V_m is the monolayer capacity (in this case, 25 mg/g)\n- N_A is Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23 molecules/mol)\n- A_m is the cross-sectional area of the adsorbate molecule (for nitrogen, it is 0.162 nm²)\n- M is the molar mass of the adsorbate molecule (for nitrogen, it is 28.02 g/mol)\n\nFirst, we need to find the amount of adsorbate in the monolayer. Since the activated carbon has a monolayer capacity of 25 mg/g and we have 5 g of activated carbon, the amount of adsorbate in the monolayer is:\n\nAmount of adsorbate = 25 mg/g * 5 g = 125 mg\n\nNow we can calculate the BET surface area:\n\nS_BET = (125 mg * 6.022 x 10^23 molecules/mol * 0.162 nm²) / (28.02 g/mol)\n\nFirst, convert the amount of adsorbate to moles:\n\n125 mg * (1 g / 1000 mg) * (1 mol / 28.02 g) = 0.00446 mol\n\nNow, plug this value back into the BET equation:\n\nS_BET = (0.00446 mol * 6.022 x 10^23 molecules/mol * 0.162 nm²) / (1)\n\nS_BET = 4.36 x 10^22 nm²\n\nTo convert the surface area to m², use the conversion factor:\n\n1 nm² = 10^-18 m²\n\nS_BET = 4.36 x 10^22 nm² * (10^-18 m² / 1 nm²) = 436 m²\n\nSo, the BET surface area of the activated carbon is approximately 436 m²."
