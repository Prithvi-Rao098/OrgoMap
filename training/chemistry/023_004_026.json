    "message_2": "To determine the yield of acetylsalicylic acid, we first need to find the limiting reagent in the reaction. The balanced chemical equation for the synthesis of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is:\n\nC7H6O3 (salicylic acid) + C4H6O3 (acetic anhydride) â†’ C9H8O4 (acetylsalicylic acid) + C2H4O2 (acetic acid)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given amounts of reactants to moles. The molar mass of salicylic acid is 138.12 g/mol, and the molar mass of acetic anhydride is 102.09 g/mol. The density of acetic anhydride is 1.08 g/mL.\n\n5 g salicylic acid * (1 mol / 138.12 g) = 0.0362 mol salicylic acid\n10 mL acetic anhydride * (1.08 g/mL) * (1 mol / 102.09 g) = 0.106 mol acetic anhydride\n\nNow, we need to determine the limiting reagent by comparing the mole ratios:\n\n0.0362 mol salicylic acid / 1 (from the balanced equation) = 0.0362\n0.106 mol acetic anhydride / 1 (from the balanced equation) = 0.106\n\nSince 0.0362 is smaller than 0.106, salicylic acid is the limiting reagent.\n\nNow, we can calculate the theoretical yield of acetylsalicylic acid:\n\n0.0362 mol salicylic acid * (1 mol acetylsalicylic acid / 1 mol salicylic acid) = 0.0362 mol acetylsalicylic acid\n\nFinally, we convert moles of acetylsalicylic acid to grams using its molar mass (180.16 g/mol):\n\n0.0362 mol acetylsalicylic acid * (180.16 g / 1 mol) = 6.52 g acetylsalicylic acid\n\nThe theoretical yield of acetylsalicylic acid is 6.52 grams. However, the actual yield might be lower due to side reactions, losses during purification, or incomplete conversion of the limiting reagent. To determine the actual yield, you would need to perform the experiment and measure the mass of the purified product."
