    "message_2": "To find the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid, we can use the formula for the ionization constant (Ka) of a weak acid:\n\nKa = [H+][A-]/[HA]\n\nIn this case, acetic acid (CH3COOH) is the weak acid, and its ionization constant (Ka) is given as 1.8 x 10^-5. When acetic acid ionizes, it forms the acetate ion (CH3COO-) and a hydrogen ion (H+). \n\nAt equilibrium, let x be the concentration of H+ ions and acetate ions (A-). The concentration of acetic acid (HA) will be 0.1 - x. We can now set up the equation:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 = (x)(x)/(0.1 - x)\n\nSince Ka is very small, we can assume that x is also very small compared to 0.1, so we can approximate the equation as:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 ≈ x^2/0.1\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx^2 = 1.8 x 10^-5 * 0.1\nx^2 = 1.8 x 10^-6\nx = √(1.8 x 10^-6)\nx ≈ 1.34 x 10^-3\n\nNow that we have the concentration of H+ ions (x), we can find the pH using the formula:\n\npH = -log[H+]\n\npH = -log(1.34 x 10^-3)\npH ≈ 2.87\n\nSo, the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid is approximately 2.87."
