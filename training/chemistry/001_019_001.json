    "message_2": "In this nucleophilic substitution reaction, the nucleophile is the hydroxide ion (OH-) from sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and the electrophile is methyl bromide (CH3Br). The hydroxide ion will attack the electrophilic carbon in methyl bromide, replacing the bromide ion (Br-). \n\nThe products of this reaction are methanol (CH3OH) and sodium bromide (NaBr). The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nCH3Br + NaOH â†’ CH3OH + NaBr"
