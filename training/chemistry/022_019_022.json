    "message_2": "To calculate the rate of reaction, we need to determine the change in the amount of reactants or products over a given time period. In this case, we are given the initial amounts of reactants and the time it takes for the reaction to occur.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\n2H₂(g) + O₂(g) → 2H₂O(g)\n\nWe are given that 2 moles of H₂ and 1 mole of O₂ react to form 2 moles of H₂O in 10 minutes. To find the rate of reaction, we can use the following formula:\n\nRate of reaction = (Change in amount of reactants or products) / (Time taken for the reaction)\n\nFor H₂:\nRate of reaction = (Initial moles - Final moles) / Time\nRate of reaction = (2 moles - 0 moles) / 10 minutes\nRate of reaction = 2 moles / 10 minutes\nRate of reaction = 0.2 moles/minute\n\nFor O₂:\nRate of reaction = (Initial moles - Final moles) / Time\nRate of reaction = (1 mole - 0 moles) / 10 minutes\nRate of reaction = 1 mole / 10 minutes\nRate of reaction = 0.1 moles/minute\n\nSince the rate of reaction for both reactants is proportional to their stoichiometric coefficients in the balanced chemical equation, we can conclude that the rate of reaction for this process is 0.1 moles/minute for O₂ and 0.2 moles/minute for H₂."
