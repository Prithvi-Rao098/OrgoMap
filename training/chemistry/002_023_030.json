    "message_2": "To determine the electrical conductivity of a solution, we need to consider the ions present in the solution, their molar conductivities, and the concentration of the solution. The molar conductivity of a solution is the product of the molar conductivities of its ions and their respective concentrations.\n\nFor a 0.1 M solution of silver nitrate (AgNO3), the ions present are Ag+ and NO3-. The molar conductivities of Ag+ and NO3- at 25°C are approximately 61.9 S cm²/mol and 71.4 S cm²/mol, respectively.\n\nThe electrical conductivity (κ) of the AgNO3 solution can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nκ = Σ(λi * ci)\n\nwhere λi is the molar conductivity of ion i, and ci is the concentration of ion i.\n\nFor the AgNO3 solution:\n\nκ = (61.9 S cm²/mol * 0.1 mol/L) + (71.4 S cm²/mol * 0.1 mol/L)\nκ = 6.19 S/m + 7.14 S/m\nκ ≈ 13.33 S/m\n\nNow, let's compare this to a 0.1 M solution of sodium chloride (NaCl). The ions present are Na+ and Cl-, with molar conductivities at 25°C of approximately 50.1 S cm²/mol and 76.3 S cm²/mol, respectively.\n\nFor the NaCl solution:\n\nκ = (50.1 S cm²/mol * 0.1 mol/L) + (76.3 S cm²/mol * 0.1 mol/L)\nκ = 5.01 S/m + 7.63 S/m\nκ ≈ 12.64 S/m\n\nComparing the electrical conductivities of the two solutions, we find that the 0.1 M AgNO3 solution has a slightly higher electrical conductivity (13.33 S/m) than the 0.1 M NaCl solution (12.64 S/m) at 25°C."
