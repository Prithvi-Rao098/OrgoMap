    "message_2": "Quantum chemistry can be used to predict the selectivity of substitution reactions in aromatic compounds by employing computational methods and theoretical models to study the electronic structure, energetics, and reaction pathways of these systems. Here are some steps to follow:\n\n1. Choose a suitable quantum chemical method: Select an appropriate level of theory, such as density functional theory (DFT), ab initio methods, or semi-empirical methods, depending on the desired accuracy and computational cost. DFT is often a good compromise between accuracy and computational efficiency for studying aromatic systems.\n\n2. Build the molecular models: Create the molecular structures of the reactants, intermediates, and products involved in the substitution reaction. This includes the aromatic compound, the substituent, and any catalysts or solvents that may be present.\n\n3. Optimize the geometries: Perform geometry optimizations for all the molecular structures to obtain their minimum energy conformations. This step is crucial for obtaining accurate energies and properties of the molecules.\n\n4. Calculate the electronic properties: Compute the electronic properties of the optimized structures, such as the molecular orbitals, electron densities, and electrostatic potentials. These properties can provide insights into the reactivity and selectivity of the substitution reaction.\n\n5. Analyze the reaction pathways: Investigate the possible reaction pathways for the substitution reaction, including the formation of intermediates, transition states, and products. Calculate the energy barriers and reaction energies for each pathway using techniques like intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations or potential energy surface (PES) scans.\n\n6. Evaluate the selectivity: Compare the energy barriers and reaction energies for the different pathways to determine the most favorable and selective route for the substitution reaction. Lower energy barriers and more exothermic reactions generally indicate higher selectivity.\n\n7. Validate the predictions: Compare the predicted selectivity with experimental data, if available, to validate the accuracy of the quantum chemical method. If necessary, refine the level of theory or include additional factors, such as solvent effects or dispersion corrections, to improve the agreement with experimental results.\n\nBy following these steps, quantum chemistry can provide valuable insights into the selectivity of substitution reactions in aromatic compounds and guide the design of more efficient and selective synthetic routes."
