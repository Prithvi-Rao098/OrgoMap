    "message_2": "To find the enthalpy of formation of methane (ΔHf°), we can use Hess's Law, which states that the total enthalpy change for a reaction is the same, regardless of the path taken. We can use the given enthalpies of combustion to create a series of reactions that will lead to the formation of methane.\n\n1. Combustion of methane:\n   CH₄(g) + 2O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l)   ΔH = -890.4 kJ/mol\n\n2. Combustion of hydrogen:\n   H₂(g) + 1/2O₂(g) → H₂O(l)   ΔH = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\n3. Combustion of carbon:\n   C(s) + O₂(g) → CO₂(g)   ΔH = -393.5 kJ/mol\n\nWe want to find the enthalpy of formation of methane, which is the reverse of reaction 1:\n\n4. Formation of methane:\n   CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) → CH₄(g) + 2O₂(g)   ΔH = +890.4 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can manipulate reactions 2 and 3 to cancel out the products in reaction 4:\n\nMultiply reaction 2 by 2 to cancel out the 2 moles of H₂O:\n\n2H₂(g) + O₂(g) → 2H₂O(l)   ΔH = -571.6 kJ/mol\n\nReaction 3 is already in the correct form to cancel out the CO₂:\n\nC(s) + O₂(g) → CO₂(g)   ΔH = -393.5 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can add the modified reactions 2 and 3 to reaction 4:\n\nCO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) → CH₄(g) + 2O₂(g)   ΔH = +890.4 kJ/mol\n2H₂(g) + O₂(g) → 2H₂O(l)   ΔH = -571.6 kJ/mol\nC(s) + O₂(g) → CO₂(g)   ΔH = -393.5 kJ/mol\n----------------------------------------------\nC(s) + 2H₂(g) → CH₄(g)   ΔH = -74.7 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy of formation of methane (CH₄) is -74.7 kJ/mol."
