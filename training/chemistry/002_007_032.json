    "message_2": "The reaction between magnesium chloride (MgCl₂) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is a double displacement reaction, also known as a metathesis reaction. In this reaction, the cations and anions of the two reactants switch places, forming two new products.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nMgCl₂ (aq) + 2 NaOH (aq) → Mg(OH)₂ (s) + 2 NaCl (aq)\n\nThe products formed are magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)₂) and sodium chloride (NaCl). Magnesium hydroxide is a solid precipitate, while sodium chloride remains dissolved in the solution."
