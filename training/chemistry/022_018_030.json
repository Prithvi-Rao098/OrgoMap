    "message_2": "The energy required to break a carbon-carbon single bond (C-C) can be found using the average bond-dissociation energy provided. In this case, the bond-dissociation energy is 347 kJ/mol. The bond length is not needed for this calculation, as the energy required to break the bond is independent of the bond length.\n\nTherefore, the energy required to break a carbon-carbon single bond (C-C) is 347 kJ/mol."
