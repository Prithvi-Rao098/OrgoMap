    "message_2": "The two organic compounds with the molecular formula C5H10 are cyclopentene (cyclic alkene) and 2-pentene (acyclic alkene). Both of these compounds exhibit positional isomerism.\n\n1. Cyclopentene:\nCyclopentene is a cyclic alkene with a five-membered ring and one double bond. Its structural formula is as follows:\n\n   H H H\n    | | |\nH-C-C=C-C-H\n    | |\n    H H\n\n2. 2-Pentene:\n2-Pentene is an acyclic alkene with a carbon chain of five carbons and one double bond between the second and third carbons. Its structural formula is as follows:\n\nH H H H H\n | | | | |\nH-C-C=C-C-C-H\n | | | | |\n H H H H H\n\nThese are the two organic compounds with the molecular formula C5H10 that exhibit positional isomerism."
