    "message_2": "To calculate the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG = ΔH - TΔS\n\nwhere ΔH is the enthalpy change, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ΔS is the entropy change.\n\nGiven values:\nΔH = -483.60 kJ/mol\nΔS = 69.91 J/mol.K\nT = 298 K\n\nFirst, we need to convert the entropy change from J/mol.K to kJ/mol.K:\n\nΔS = 69.91 J/mol.K * (1 kJ / 1000 J) = 0.06991 kJ/mol.K\n\nNow we can plug the values into the equation:\n\nΔG = (-483.60 kJ/mol) - (298 K * 0.06991 kJ/mol.K)\nΔG = -483.60 kJ/mol - 20.81 kJ/mol\nΔG = -504.41 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard Gibbs free energy change for the reaction is -504.41 kJ/mol."
