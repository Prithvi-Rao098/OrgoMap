    "message_1": "What is the solubility of potassium nitrate (KNO3) in water at room temperature (25°C), and how does this value compare to the solubility of sodium chloride (NaCl) in water at the same temperature?",
    "message_2": "The solubility of potassium nitrate (KNO3) in water at room temperature (25°C) is approximately 37 grams per 100 grams of water. This means that 37 grams of KNO3 can dissolve in 100 grams of water at 25°C.\n\nThe solubility of sodium chloride (NaCl) in water at room temperature (25°C) is approximately 36 grams per 100 grams of water. This means that 36 grams of NaCl can dissolve in 100 grams of water at 25°C.\n\nComparing the solubility of KNO3 and NaCl at 25°C, potassium nitrate is slightly more soluble in water than sodium chloride."
