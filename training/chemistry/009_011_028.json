    "message_2": "To determine the age of the rock sample, we can use the half-life formula:\n\nN = N0 * (1/2)^(t / T)\n\nWhere:\nN = the current amount of the radioactive isotope (0.25 grams)\nN0 = the initial amount of the radioactive isotope (2 grams)\nt = the age of the sample (which we want to find)\nT = the half-life of the radioactive isotope (1,000 years)\n\n0.25 = 2 * (1/2)^(t / 1,000)\n\nNow, we need to solve for t:\n\n0.25 / 2 = (1/2)^(t / 1,000)\n\n0.125 = (1/2)^(t / 1,000)\n\nTo solve for t, we can take the logarithm of both sides:\n\nlog(0.125) = log((1/2)^(t / 1,000))\n\nlog(0.125) = (t / 1,000) * log(1/2)\n\nNow, we can isolate t:\n\nt = 1,000 * (log(0.125) / log(1/2))\n\nt ≈ 1,000 * (-0.9031 / -0.3010)\n\nt ≈ 1,000 * 3\n\nt ≈ 3,000 years\n\nSo, the age of the rock sample is approximately 3,000 years old."
