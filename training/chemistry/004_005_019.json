    "message_2": "To determine the pH of a 0.1 M solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl), we can use the formula:\n\npH = -log10[H+]\n\nHydrochloric acid is a strong acid, which means it completely dissociates in water:\n\nHCl → H+ + Cl-\n\nIn a 0.1 M solution of HCl, the concentration of H+ ions is also 0.1 M. Now we can use the formula to calculate the pH:\n\npH = -log10(0.1)\npH = -(-1)\npH = 1\n\nSo, the pH of a 0.1 M solution of hydrochloric acid at 25°C is 1."
