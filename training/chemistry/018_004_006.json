    "message_2": "To determine the activation energy (Ea) of the reaction, we will use the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk = Ae^(-Ea/RT)\n\nwhere k is the rate constant, A is the pre-exponential factor, Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin:\n\n25°C = 298 K\n30°C = 303 K\n35°C = 308 K\n40°C = 313 K\n\nNow, we will use the data points to create two linear equations using the natural logarithm of the Arrhenius equation:\n\nln(k1) = ln(A) - Ea/(R * T1)\nln(k2) = ln(A) - Ea/(R * T2)\n\nWe will use the data points at 25°C (298 K) and 40°C (313 K) to create the equations:\n\nln(0.001) = ln(A) - Ea/(8.314 * 298)\nln(0.027) = ln(A) - Ea/(8.314 * 313)\n\nNow, we will subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate ln(A):\n\nln(0.027) - ln(0.001) = Ea/(8.314 * 313) - Ea/(8.314 * 298)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nln(27) = Ea * (1/(8.314 * 313) - 1/(8.314 * 298))\n\nNow, solve for Ea:\n\nEa = ln(27) / (1/(8.314 * 313) - 1/(8.314 * 298))\nEa ≈ 52.6 kJ/mol\n\nThe activation energy of the reaction between hydrochloric acid and sodium thiosulfate is approximately 52.6 kJ/mol."
