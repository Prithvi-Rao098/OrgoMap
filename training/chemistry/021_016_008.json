    "message_2": "The electronegativity difference between chlorine and sodium in a sodium chloride (NaCl) molecule can be found by subtracting the electronegativity values of the two elements.\n\nChlorine has an electronegativity value of 3.16, while sodium has an electronegativity value of 0.93. \n\nThe electronegativity difference between chlorine and sodium in NaCl is:\n\n3.16 (Cl) - 0.93 (Na) = 2.23\n\nSo, the electronegativity difference between chlorine and sodium in a NaCl molecule is 2.23."
