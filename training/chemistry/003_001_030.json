    "message_2": "To calculate the change in enthalpy (ΔH) for the combustion of propane, we need to use the following equation:\n\nΔH = Σ ΔHf(products) - Σ ΔHf(reactants)\n\nFirst, we need the heat of formation (ΔHf) values for all the products and reactants involved in the combustion reaction. The given ΔHf for propane (C3H8) is -103.85 kJ/mol. We also need the ΔHf values for O2, CO2, and H2O. The standard ΔHf values for these compounds are:\n\nO2(g): 0 kJ/mol (since it is an element in its standard state)\nCO2(g): -393.5 kJ/mol\nH2O(l): -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔH = [3 × (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 4 × (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [1 × (-103.85 kJ/mol) + 5 × 0 kJ/mol]\n\nΔH = (-1180.5 kJ + -1143.2 kJ) - (-103.85 kJ)\n\nΔH = -2323.7 kJ + 103.85 kJ\n\nΔH = -2219.85 kJ\n\nSo, the change in enthalpy (ΔH) for the combustion of propane at standard conditions is approximately -2219.85 kJ/mol."
