    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the formation of 1 mole of methane (CH4) from its constituent elements carbon and hydrogen gas, we can use Hess's Law. However, the given enthalpies of formation are not directly related to the formation of methane. We need to find a reaction that relates to the formation of methane and use the given enthalpies to calculate the desired enthalpy change.\n\nThe formation of methane can be represented by the following reaction:\n\nC(s) + 2H2(g) → CH4(g)\n\nNow, we can use the given enthalpies of formation to create a series of reactions that will eventually lead to the formation of methane. One possible set of reactions is:\n\n1. C(s) + O2(g) → CO2(g)  ΔH1 = -393.5 kJ/mol\n2. 2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(l)  ΔH2 = 2(-285.8) kJ/mol = -571.6 kJ/mol\n3. CH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(l)  ΔH3 = ΔH⦵f(CH4)\n\nNow, we can manipulate these reactions to obtain the desired reaction (C(s) + 2H2(g) → CH4(g)). We will reverse reaction 1 and subtract reaction 2 from reaction 3:\n\n-1 * (C(s) + O2(g) → CO2(g)) + (CH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(l)) - (2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(l))\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nC(s) + 2H2(g) → CH4(g)\n\nNow, we can apply Hess's Law to calculate the enthalpy change for the formation of methane:\n\nΔH⦵f(CH4) = -1 * ΔH1 + ΔH3 - ΔH2\nΔH⦵f(CH4) = -1 * (-393.5 kJ/mol) + ΔH⦵f(CH4) - (-571.6 kJ/mol)\nΔH⦵f(CH4) = 393.5 kJ/mol + ΔH⦵f(CH4) + 571.6 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can solve for ΔH⦵f(CH4):\n\nΔH⦵f(CH4) = -393.5 kJ/mol + 571.6 kJ/mol\nΔH⦵f(CH4) = 178.1 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change for the formation of 1 mole of methane (CH4) from its constituent elements carbon and hydrogen gas is 178.1 kJ/mol."
