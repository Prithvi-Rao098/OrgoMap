    "message_2": "To determine the percentage composition of copper and sulfur by weight in a sample of copper sulfide, we first need to know the molecular formula of copper sulfide. There are two common forms of copper sulfide: copper(I) sulfide (Cu2S) and copper(II) sulfide (CuS).\n\nFor copper(I) sulfide (Cu2S):\n1. Calculate the molar mass of Cu2S:\nCu: 63.55 g/mol (2 moles of Cu in Cu2S) = 127.10 g/mol\nS: 32.07 g/mol\nTotal molar mass of Cu2S = 127.10 + 32.07 = 159.17 g/mol\n\n2. Calculate the percentage composition:\n%Cu = (127.10 g/mol / 159.17 g/mol) × 100 = 79.87%\n%S = (32.07 g/mol / 159.17 g/mol) × 100 = 20.13%\n\nFor copper(II) sulfide (CuS):\n1. Calculate the molar mass of CuS:\nCu: 63.55 g/mol\nS: 32.07 g/mol\nTotal molar mass of CuS = 63.55 + 32.07 = 95.62 g/mol\n\n2. Calculate the percentage composition:\n%Cu = (63.55 g/mol / 95.62 g/mol) × 100 = 66.47%\n%S = (32.07 g/mol / 95.62 g/mol) × 100 = 33.53%\n\nSo, the percentage composition of copper and sulfur by weight in a sample of copper sulfide depends on the type of copper sulfide:\n\n- For copper(I) sulfide (Cu2S): 79.87% Cu and 20.13% S\n- For copper(II) sulfide (CuS): 66.47% Cu and 33.53% S"
