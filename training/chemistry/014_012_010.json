    "message_2": "Sc3N@C80 is a metallofullerene containing three scandium (Sc) atoms and one nitrogen (N) atom encapsulated inside a C80 fullerene cage. The metal center in Sc3N@C80 has a unique structural and electronic configuration compared to other scandium-containing metallofullerenes and metalloclusters.\n\nStructural Configuration:\nIn Sc3N@C80, the three scandium atoms and the nitrogen atom form a tetrahedral Sc3N cluster inside the C80 cage. Each scandium atom is coordinated to the nitrogen atom and two carbon atoms of the fullerene cage. This results in a six-coordinate scandium center with a distorted octahedral geometry. The Sc-N bond lengths are approximately 2.1 Å, and the Sc-C bond lengths are around 2.3 Å.\n\nElectronic Configuration:\nScandium has the electron configuration [Ar] 3d1 4s2. In Sc3N@C80, each scandium atom loses two electrons to form Sc(III) ions with the electron configuration [Ar] 3d0 4s0. The three scandium ions are bonded to the nitrogen atom, which acts as a μ3-bridging ligand. The nitrogen atom gains three electrons, resulting in an N3- ion with the electron configuration [He] 2s2 2p6. The three Sc(III) ions and the N3- ion form a closed-shell Sc3N cluster with a total charge of +9, which is balanced by the 9 electrons transferred from the Sc atoms to the C80 cage.\n\nCoordination of Scandium in Sc3N@C80 vs. other Scandium-containing Metallofullerenes and Metalloclusters:\nThe coordination of scandium in Sc3N@C80 is different from that in other scandium-containing metallofullerenes and metalloclusters. In Sc3N@C80, the scandium atoms are six-coordinate with a distorted octahedral geometry, while in other scandium-containing systems, the coordination number and geometry can vary depending on the specific structure and ligands involved. For example, in Sc2C2@C82, the two scandium atoms are five-coordinate with a square pyramidal geometry, and in Sc4C2@C80, the scandium atoms have a range of coordination numbers and geometries. The unique coordination environment in Sc3N@C80 is a result of the encapsulated nitrogen atom, which acts as a μ3-bridging ligand and influences the overall structure and electronic properties of the metal center."
