    "message_2": "To find the percent composition by mass of each element in iron (III) oxide (Fe2O3), we first need to determine the molar mass of the compound and then calculate the percentage of each element.\n\n1. Determine the molar mass of Fe2O3:\n- Iron (Fe) has an atomic mass of 55.845 g/mol. Since there are two iron atoms in the compound, the total mass of iron is 2 * 55.845 = 111.69 g/mol.\n- Oxygen (O) has an atomic mass of 16.00 g/mol. Since there are three oxygen atoms in the compound, the total mass of oxygen is 3 * 16.00 = 48.00 g/mol.\n- The molar mass of Fe2O3 is the sum of the mass of iron and oxygen: 111.69 g/mol (Fe) + 48.00 g/mol (O) = 159.69 g/mol.\n\n2. Calculate the percent composition by mass of each element:\n- For iron (Fe): (111.69 g/mol (Fe) / 159.69 g/mol (Fe2O3)) * 100% = 69.94%\n- For oxygen (O): (48.00 g/mol (O) / 159.69 g/mol (Fe2O3)) * 100% = 30.06%\n\nThe percent composition by mass of each element in iron (III) oxide (Fe2O3) is approximately 69.94% iron (Fe) and 30.06% oxygen (O)."
