    "message_2": "To calculate the pH of the buffer solution, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log ([A-]/[HA])\n\nwhere pH is the pH of the solution, pKa is the negative logarithm of the dissociation constant (Ka), [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base (sodium acetate), and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid (acetic acid).\n\nFirst, let's find the pKa value:\n\npKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.8x10^-5) â‰ˆ 4.74\n\nNow, we can plug the concentrations of acetic acid and sodium acetate into the equation:\n\npH = 4.74 + log ([0.1]/[0.1])\n\nSince the concentrations of the conjugate base and weak acid are equal, the log term becomes log(1), which is 0. Therefore, the pH of the buffer solution is:\n\npH = 4.74 + 0 = 4.74"
