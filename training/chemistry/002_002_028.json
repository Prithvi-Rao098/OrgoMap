    "message_2": "In sodium sulfite (Na2SO3), the oxidation state of sodium (Na) is +1 and oxygen (O) is -2. The compound has two sodium atoms, so the total positive charge from sodium is +2. There are three oxygen atoms, so the total negative charge from oxygen is -6.\n\nTo find the oxidation state of sulfur (S), we need to balance the charges in the compound. Let x be the oxidation state of sulfur. The sum of the charges in the compound should be equal to zero.\n\n+2 + x + (-6) = 0\n\nx - 4 = 0\n\nx = +4\n\nSo, the oxidation state of sulfur in sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) is +4."
