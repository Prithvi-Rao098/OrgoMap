    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the precipitation reaction, we need to use the standard enthalpies of formation for each compound involved in the reaction. The standard enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states.\n\nThe standard enthalpies of formation for the compounds involved in the reaction are as follows:\n\n$\\mathrm{CaCl_2 (s)}$: -795 kJ/mol\n$\\mathrm{AgNO_3 (aq)}$: -123 kJ/mol\n$\\mathrm{AgCl (s)}$: -127 kJ/mol\n$\\mathrm{Ca(NO_3)_2 (aq)}$: -663 kJ/mol\n\nUsing Hess's Law, we can calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nΔH° = [2 * ΔH°(AgCl) + ΔH°(Ca(NO₃)₂)] - [ΔH°(CaCl₂) + 2 * ΔH°(AgNO₃)]\n\nΔH° = [2 * (-127 kJ/mol) + (-663 kJ/mol)] - [(-795 kJ/mol) + 2 * (-123 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH° = (-254 kJ - 663 kJ) - (-795 kJ - 246 kJ)\n\nΔH° = (-917 kJ) - (-1041 kJ)\n\nΔH° = 124 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the precipitation reaction between solid calcium chloride and aqueous silver nitrate to form solid silver chloride and aqueous calcium nitrate is 124 kJ."
