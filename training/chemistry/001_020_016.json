    "message_2": "The electrophilic addition of hydrogen bromide (HBr) to propene (C3H6) is a two-step process that involves the formation of a carbocation intermediate. The mechanism is as follows:\n\nStep 1: Protonation of the alkene\nIn the first step, the alkene (propene) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic hydrogen atom of the HBr molecule. This results in the breaking of the H-Br bond, with the electrons from the bond moving to the bromine atom. Consequently, a carbocation intermediate is formed, and a bromide ion (Br-) is generated as a leaving group.\n\nPropene: CH3-CH=CH2\nHBr: H-Br\n\nCH3-CH=CH2 + H-Br → CH3-CH(+)-CH3 + Br(-)\n\nStep 2: Nucleophilic attack by the bromide ion\nIn the second step, the bromide ion (Br-) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbocation intermediate, specifically the positively charged carbon atom. This leads to the formation of the final product, 2-bromopropane.\n\nCarbocation intermediate: CH3-CH(+)-CH3\nBromide ion: Br(-)\n\nCH3-CH(+)-CH3 + Br(-) → CH3-CH(Br)-CH3\n\nStereochemistry of the product:\nThe electrophilic addition of HBr to propene results in the formation of 2-bromopropane. Since the reaction proceeds through a carbocation intermediate, there is no specific stereochemistry involved in this reaction. The product formed is a single achiral molecule, and there is no formation of enantiomers or diastereomers.\n\nIn summary, the electrophilic addition of HBr to propene involves the protonation of the alkene to form a carbocation intermediate, followed by the nucleophilic attack of the bromide ion to generate the final product, 2-bromopropane. The product has no specific stereochemistry as it is an achiral molecule."
