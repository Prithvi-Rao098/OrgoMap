    "message_2": "Designing a drug that specifically targets COX-2 without affecting COX-1 requires a deep understanding of the structural differences between the two enzymes and exploiting those differences to create a selective inhibitor. Here are the steps to design such a drug:\n\n1. Study the crystal structures: Analyze the available crystal structures of both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes to identify the differences in their active sites. This will help you understand the unique features of each enzyme that can be targeted for selective inhibition.\n\n2. Identify key differences: Focus on the differences in amino acid residues and the overall shape of the active sites in COX-1 and COX-2. For example, COX-2 has a larger active site due to a substitution of isoleucine with valine, which creates a side pocket that is not present in COX-1.\n\n3. Design a selective inhibitor: Based on the identified differences, design a molecule that can selectively bind to the active site of COX-2 without interacting with COX-1. The molecule should have functional groups that can form specific interactions with the unique amino acid residues in COX-2's active site.\n\n4. Perform computational modeling: Use computational methods such as molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations to predict the binding affinity and selectivity of the designed molecule for COX-2 over COX-1. This will help you refine the structure of the inhibitor and optimize its selectivity.\n\n5. Synthesize the inhibitor: Once you have a promising candidate, synthesize the molecule in the laboratory and test its activity against purified COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes using in vitro assays.\n\n6. Evaluate pharmacokinetics and toxicity: Assess the pharmacokinetic properties of the inhibitor, such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, to ensure it has suitable drug-like properties. Additionally, perform toxicity studies to ensure the inhibitor is safe for use.\n\n7. In vivo testing: Test the efficacy and safety of the inhibitor in animal models of inflammation or pain to evaluate its potential as a therapeutic agent.\n\n8. Clinical trials: If the inhibitor shows promising results in preclinical studies, proceed with clinical trials to evaluate its safety and efficacy in humans.\n\nBy following these steps and focusing on the structural differences between COX-1 and COX-2, it is possible to design a drug that selectively targets COX-2 without affecting COX-1."
