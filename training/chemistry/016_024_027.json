The temperature of the mixture increases by 5.0 °C. Given the specific heat capacity of the solution is 4.18 J/g °C and the density of the solution is 1.0 g/mL.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change of precipitation, we first need to determine the amount of heat released during the reaction. We can do this using the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat released, m is the mass of the solution, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nFirst, let's find the mass of the solution. Since the density of the solution is 1.0 g/mL, and we have 50 mL of each solution, the total mass of the solution is:\n\nm = (50 mL + 50 mL) * 1.0 g/mL = 100 g\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nq = (100 g) * (4.18 J/g °C) * (5.0 °C) = 2090 J\n\nNext, we need to determine the moles of the precipitate formed. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nAgNO3 (aq) + NaCl (aq) → AgCl (s) + NaNO3 (aq)\n\nSince both solutions have the same concentration (0.1 M) and volume (50 mL), they will react in a 1:1 ratio. To find the moles of the precipitate (AgCl) formed, we can use the formula:\n\nmoles = Molarity * Volume\n\nmoles of AgCl = 0.1 M * 0.050 L = 0.005 mol\n\nFinally, we can calculate the enthalpy change of precipitation (ΔH) using the formula:\n\nΔH = q / moles\n\nΔH = 2090 J / 0.005 mol = 418000 J/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change of precipitation for this reaction is 418 kJ/mol."
