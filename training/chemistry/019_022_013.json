    "message_1": "Calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction of 2 moles of liquid ethanol (C2H5OH) reacting with 1 mole of gaseous oxygen (O2) to form 2 moles of gaseous carbon dioxide (CO2) and 3 moles of liquid water (H2O) at a temperature of 298K. Assume the reactants and products are at standard state conditions.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH° = Σ ΔH°f(products) - Σ ΔH°f(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH° is the standard enthalpy change, and ΔH°f is the standard enthalpy of formation for each substance.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard enthalpy of formation for each substance involved in the reaction:\n\nC2H5OH (l): -277.69 kJ/mol\nO2 (g): 0 kJ/mol (since it is in its standard state)\nCO2 (g): -393.51 kJ/mol\nH2O (l): -285.83 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔH° = [2(-393.51) + 3(-285.83)] - [2(-277.69) + 1(0)]\nΔH° = [-787.02 - 857.49] - [-555.38 + 0]\nΔH° = -1644.51 + 555.38\nΔH° = -1089.13 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the reaction is -1089.13 kJ."
