    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the formula:\n\nΔH = Σ ΔHf(products) - Σ ΔHf(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH is the enthalpy change, and ΔHf is the standard enthalpy of formation.\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\n2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(l)\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation for the products is:\n\n2 * (-285.8 kJ/mol) = -571.6 kJ/mol (for 2 moles of H2O)\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation for the reactants is:\n\n2 * 0 kJ/mol (for 2 moles of H2) + 0 kJ/mol (for 1 mole of O2) = 0 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change:\n\nΔH = (-571.6 kJ/mol) - (0 kJ/mol) = -571.6 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change for the reaction is -571.6 kJ/mol."
