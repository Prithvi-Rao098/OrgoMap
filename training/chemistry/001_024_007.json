    "message_2": "To identify the functional groups present in an unknown compound using IR spectroscopy, you need to analyze the characteristic peaks observed in the spectrum. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is a technique that measures the absorption of infrared radiation by a molecule, which corresponds to the vibrations of its chemical bonds. Different functional groups have specific absorption bands, which can be used to identify them.\n\nHere are some common functional groups and their characteristic IR absorption peaks:\n\n1. Alcohols and Phenols: O-H stretching vibrations are observed around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹ as a broad peak. In phenols, the peak may be slightly broader and shifted to a lower wavenumber.\n\n2. Carboxylic Acids: O-H stretching vibrations are observed around 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ as a broad peak. Additionally, a strong and sharp peak for C=O stretching is observed around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n\n3. Amines: N-H stretching vibrations are observed around 3300-3500 cm⁻¹ as a medium to strong peak. Primary amines show two peaks, while secondary amines show only one peak.\n\n4. Aldehydes and Ketones: C=O stretching vibrations are observed around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹ as a strong and sharp peak. Aldehydes also show a characteristic peak for C-H stretching around 2700-2900 cm⁻¹.\n\n5. Amides: N-H stretching vibrations are observed around 3100-3500 cm⁻¹ as a medium to strong peak. Additionally, a strong and sharp peak for C=O stretching is observed around 1630-1690 cm⁻¹.\n\n6. Nitriles: C≡N stretching vibrations are observed around 2210-2260 cm⁻¹ as a medium to strong peak.\n\n7. Aromatic Compounds: C-H stretching vibrations are observed around 3030 cm⁻¹ as a medium peak. Additionally, C=C stretching vibrations are observed around 1450-1600 cm⁻¹ as multiple peaks.\n\n8. Alkenes: C-H stretching vibrations are observed around 3000-3100 cm⁻¹ as a medium peak. Additionally, C=C stretching vibrations are observed around 1640-1680 cm⁻¹ as a strong peak.\n\n9. Alkynes: C-H stretching vibrations are observed around 3300 cm⁻¹ as a medium to strong peak. Additionally, C≡C stretching vibrations are observed around 2100-2250 cm⁻¹ as a weak peak.\n\nTo identify the functional groups in the unknown compound, compare the observed peaks in the IR spectrum with the characteristic peaks mentioned above. Note that the presence of multiple functional groups may cause overlapping or shifting of peaks, so careful analysis is required."
