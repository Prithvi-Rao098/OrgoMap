    "message_2": "To determine the rate law, we need to find the order of reaction with respect to each reactant. We can do this by comparing the initial rates and concentrations of the reactants in different experiments.\n\nFirst, let's find the order with respect to NO:\n\nCompare experiments 1 and 2, where the concentration of O2 is constant:\nInitial Rate (2) / Initial Rate (1) = ([NO]_2 / [NO]_1)^x\n0.16 / 0.040 = (0.20 / 0.10)^x\n4 = 2^x\nx = 2\n\nSo the reaction is second order with respect to NO.\n\nNow let's find the order with respect to O2:\n\nCompare experiments 1 and 3, where the concentration of NO is constant:\nInitial Rate (3) / Initial Rate (1) = ([O2]_3 / [O2]_1)^y\n0.080 / 0.040 = (0.20 / 0.10)^y\n2 = 2^y\ny = 1\n\nSo the reaction is first order with respect to O2.\n\nNow we can write the rate law:\nRate = k[NO]^2[O2]^1\n\nThe overall order of the reaction is the sum of the orders with respect to each reactant:\nOverall order = 2 (NO) + 1 (O2) = 3"
