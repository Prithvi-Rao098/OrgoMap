    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH° = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH° is the standard enthalpy change, and ΔHf° is the standard enthalpy of formation.\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\nCH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(g)\n\nThe standard enthalpies of formation are:\n\nΔHf°(CH4) = -74.8 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(CO2) = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(H2O) = -241.8 kJ/mol\n\nSince O2 is an element in its standard state, its enthalpy of formation is 0 kJ/mol.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔH° = [1 × (-393.5) + 2 × (-241.8)] - [1 × (-74.8) + 2 × 0]\n\nΔH° = (-393.5 - 483.6) - (-74.8)\n\nΔH° = -877.1 + 74.8\n\nΔH° = -802.3 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the reaction between methane and oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water vapor at 298 K and 1 atm of pressure is -802.3 kJ/mol."
