    "message_2": "When an external magnetic field is applied to a molecule, the magnetic moment of the molecule can change due to the interaction between the magnetic field and the electrons in the molecule. This interaction can lead to changes in the energy levels, molecular orbitals, and spin states of the electrons, which in turn can affect the overall magnetic moment of the molecule.\n\nQuantum mechanical calculations can be used to predict and explain these changes in the magnetic moment by considering the electronic structure of the molecule and the applied magnetic field. One of the most common approaches to study the magnetic properties of molecules is by using the method of electronic structure calculations based on quantum mechanics, such as the Hartree-Fock method, density functional theory (DFT), or more advanced post-Hartree-Fock methods like configuration interaction (CI) and coupled-cluster (CC) theory.\n\nThese calculations involve solving the Schrödinger equation for the molecule in the presence of the external magnetic field. The Schrödinger equation describes the behavior of the electrons in the molecule and their interactions with the magnetic field. By solving this equation, we can obtain the wavefunctions and energy levels of the electrons, which can then be used to calculate the magnetic properties of the molecule, such as the magnetic moment.\n\nIn these calculations, the magnetic field is typically treated as a perturbation to the electronic Hamiltonian, which is the operator that describes the energy of the electrons in the molecule. The perturbation due to the magnetic field can be included in the Hamiltonian using the Zeeman effect, which describes the splitting of energy levels in the presence of a magnetic field. The Zeeman effect can be further divided into the orbital and spin Zeeman effects, which account for the interactions of the magnetic field with the orbital and spin angular momenta of the electrons, respectively.\n\nOnce the electronic structure calculations are performed, the magnetic moment of the molecule can be calculated as the expectation value of the magnetic moment operator, which is related to the orbital and spin angular momenta of the electrons. The magnetic moment can then be analyzed to understand how it changes in response to the applied magnetic field and to gain insights into the magnetic properties of the molecule.\n\nIn summary, quantum mechanical calculations can be used to predict and explain the changes in the magnetic moment of a molecule when an external magnetic field is applied by considering the electronic structure of the molecule and the interactions between the electrons and the magnetic field. These calculations can provide valuable information about the magnetic properties of molecules and help guide the design of new materials with desired magnetic properties."
