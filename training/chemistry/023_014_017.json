    "message_2": "To find the optimal molar ratio of acetanilide to bromine, we first need to determine the molecular weights of acetanilide, bromine, and 4-bromoacetanilide.\n\nMolecular weight of acetanilide (C8H9NO) = (12.01 x 8) + (1.01 x 9) + (14.01 x 1) + (16.00 x 1) = 135.17 g/mol\nMolecular weight of bromine (Br2) = 2 x 79.90 = 159.80 g/mol\nMolecular weight of 4-bromoacetanilide (C8H8BrNO) = 135.17 + 79.90 = 215.07 g/mol\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nC8H9NO + Br2 â†’ C8H8BrNO + HBr\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that the molar ratio of acetanilide to bromine is 1:1.\n\nNow, we need to find the moles of 4-bromoacetanilide required to yield 10 grams:\n\nmoles of 4-bromoacetanilide = mass / molecular weight = 10 g / 215.07 g/mol = 0.0465 mol\n\nSince the molar ratio of acetanilide to bromine is 1:1, we also need 0.0465 moles of acetanilide and 0.0465 moles of bromine for the reaction.\n\nSo, the optimal molar ratio of acetanilide to bromine required to yield 10 grams of 4-bromoacetanilide is 1:1."
