    "message_2": "To find the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid, we can use the formula for the ionization constant (Ka) and the definition of pH. \n\nFirst, let's write the ionization equation for acetic acid (CH3COOH):\n\nCH3COOH ⇌ CH3COO- + H+\n\nNow, let's set up an equilibrium expression using the ionization constant (Ka):\n\nKa = [CH3COO-][H+] / [CH3COOH]\n\nWe are given the Ka value as 1.8 x 10^-5, and the initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.1 M. Let x be the concentration of H+ ions at equilibrium:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 = (x)(x) / (0.1 - x)\n\nSince Ka is very small, we can assume that x is also very small compared to 0.1, so we can simplify the equation as:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 ≈ (x)(x) / 0.1\n\nNow, let's solve for x:\n\nx^2 = 1.8 x 10^-5 * 0.1\nx^2 = 1.8 x 10^-6\nx ≈ 1.34 x 10^-3\n\nSince x represents the concentration of H+ ions at equilibrium, we can now calculate the pH using the definition of pH:\n\npH = -log10[H+]\npH = -log10(1.34 x 10^-3)\npH ≈ 2.87\n\nSo, the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid at 25°C is approximately 2.87."
