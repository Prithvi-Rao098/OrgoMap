    "message_2": "To find the percent composition of chlorine in calcium chloride (CaCl2), we need to determine the molar mass of CaCl2 and the molar mass of chlorine (Cl) in the compound.\n\nFirst, let's find the molar mass of each element in the compound:\n- Calcium (Ca): 40.08 g/mol\n- Chlorine (Cl): 35.45 g/mol\n\nNow, let's find the molar mass of CaCl2:\nCaCl2 = (1 × 40.08 g/mol) + (2 × 35.45 g/mol) = 40.08 + 70.90 = 110.98 g/mol\n\nNext, we need to find the mass of chlorine in the compound:\nMass of chlorine (2 × Cl) = 2 × 35.45 g/mol = 70.90 g/mol\n\nFinally, we can find the percent composition of chlorine in CaCl2:\nPercent composition of chlorine = (mass of chlorine / molar mass of CaCl2) × 100\nPercent composition of chlorine = (70.90 g/mol / 110.98 g/mol) × 100 = 63.91%\n\nThe percent composition of chlorine in calcium chloride (CaCl2) is approximately 63.91%."
