    "message_2": "To determine the composition of the unknown gas mixture, we will use gas chromatography (GC) to separate and analyze the individual components. Here is a step-by-step process to achieve this:\n\n1. Prepare the gas chromatograph: Set up the GC instrument with the appropriate column, carrier gas, and temperature program. The choice of column and carrier gas will depend on the expected components in the gas mixture. For example, a polar column can be used for polar compounds, while a non-polar column can be used for non-polar compounds. Helium or nitrogen can be used as carrier gases.\n\n2. Inject the gas sample: Introduce a known volume of the gas sample into the GC instrument using a gas-tight syringe or an automatic injector. The sample will be vaporized in the injection port and carried through the column by the carrier gas.\n\n3. Separation of components: As the gas mixture moves through the column, the individual components will separate based on their interaction with the column material and their boiling points. Components with stronger interactions and higher boiling points will take longer to travel through the column.\n\n4. Detection and quantification: As the separated components exit the column, they will be detected by a detector, such as a flame ionization detector (FID) or a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The detector will generate a signal proportional to the concentration of each component, producing a chromatogram with peaks representing each compound.\n\n5. Identify the components: Compare the retention times of the peaks in the unknown sample's chromatogram to those of known standards. This will help identify the individual components in the gas mixture.\n\n6. Calculate the percentage composition: Integrate the area under each peak in the chromatogram, which is proportional to the concentration of each component. Then, divide the area of each peak by the total area of all peaks and multiply by 100 to obtain the percentage composition of each component in the gas mixture.\n\nBy following these steps, you can successfully determine the composition of the unknown gas mixture obtained from the industrial plant."
