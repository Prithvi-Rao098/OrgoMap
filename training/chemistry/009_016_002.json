    "message_1": "A student is analyzing a sample of unknown origin using gamma spectroscopy. The gamma spectrum shows a peak at 662 keV and another peak at 1173 keV. The student suspects that the sample contains cesium-137 and cobalt-60. What is the activity of each radionuclide in the sample (in Bq) if the counting efficiency is 25% for the 662 keV peak and 10% for the 1173 keV peak?",
    "message_2": "To determine the activity of each radionuclide in the sample, we need to know the number of counts per second (cps) for each peak. However, this information is not provided in the problem statement. Assuming you have the cps values for each peak, you can calculate the activity (in Bq) using the following steps:\n\n1. Convert the counting efficiency percentages to decimals: 25% = 0.25 and 10% = 0.10.\n\n2. Divide the cps value for each peak by the corresponding counting efficiency:\n\n   Activity of Cs-137 (in Bq) = (cps at 662 keV) / 0.25\n   Activity of Co-60 (in Bq) = (cps at 1173 keV) / 0.10\n\nPlease provide the cps values for each peak, and I can help you calculate the activity of each radionuclide in the sample."
