The activation energy of the reaction is 30 kJ/mol, and the frequency factor is 2.5 x 10^8 L/mol.s.",
    "message_2": "To find the rate constant for the free-radical polymerization of styrene, we can use the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk = A * e^(-Ea / RT)\n\nwhere k is the rate constant, A is the frequency factor (2.5 x 10^8 L/mol.s), Ea is the activation energy (30 kJ/mol), R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol.K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin (60°C + 273.15 = 333.15 K).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the activation energy from kJ/mol to J/mol:\n\nEa = 30 kJ/mol * (1000 J/1 kJ) = 30000 J/mol\n\nNow we can plug the values into the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk = (2.5 x 10^8 L/mol.s) * e^(-30000 J/mol / (8.314 J/mol.K * 333.15 K))\n\nk ≈ (2.5 x 10^8 L/mol.s) * e^(-10.91)\n\nk ≈ (2.5 x 10^8 L/mol.s) * 1.83 x 10^(-5)\n\nk ≈ 4.58 L/mol.s\n\nSo, the rate constant for the free-radical polymerization of styrene at 60°C is approximately 4.58 L/mol.s."
