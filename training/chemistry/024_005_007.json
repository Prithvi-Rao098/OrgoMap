    "message_2": "To design a process for the purification of crude caffeine extracted from coffee beans, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Extraction: First, we need to extract the caffeine from the coffee beans. This can be done using a solvent extraction method, such as the use of supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2) or a mixture of water and an organic solvent like dichloromethane or ethyl acetate. The coffee beans are soaked in the solvent, which dissolves the caffeine. The solvent containing the dissolved caffeine is then separated from the coffee beans.\n\n2. Evaporation: The solvent containing the caffeine is evaporated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator. This process removes the solvent, leaving behind the crude caffeine as a solid residue.\n\n3. Sublimation: To further purify the crude caffeine, we can use the sublimation technique. Sublimation is the process of converting a solid directly into a gas without passing through the liquid phase. Caffeine has a relatively high vapor pressure, which allows it to be purified through sublimation. Place the crude caffeine in a sublimation apparatus and heat it under vacuum. The caffeine will sublime, leaving behind impurities, and the purified caffeine will be collected on a cooled surface.\n\n4. Recrystallization: To ensure high purity, we can perform a recrystallization step. Dissolve the purified caffeine in a minimal amount of hot solvent, such as water or a mixture of water and ethanol. As the solution cools, the caffeine will crystallize out of the solution, leaving behind any remaining impurities in the solvent. Filter the crystals and wash them with a small amount of cold solvent to remove any residual impurities.\n\n5. Drying: Finally, dry the purified caffeine crystals under vacuum or in a desiccator to remove any remaining solvent. This will yield a high-purity caffeine product with minimal loss.\n\nBy following these steps, we can effectively purify crude caffeine extracted from coffee beans using available techniques and equipment, ensuring high purity and minimum loss of product."
