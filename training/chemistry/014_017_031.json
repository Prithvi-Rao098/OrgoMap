    "message_2": "The coordination geometry of the metal ion (iron, Fe2+) in hemoglobin protein is octahedral. In the heme group of hemoglobin, the iron ion is coordinated to four nitrogen atoms from the porphyrin ring, one nitrogen atom from the imidazole side chain of a histidine residue, and one oxygen molecule (O2) as the sixth ligand. This arrangement forms an octahedral geometry around the iron ion."
