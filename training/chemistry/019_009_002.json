    "message_2": "To calculate the standard free energy change (ΔG°) for the redox reaction, we first need to determine the overall cell potential (E°) for the reaction. We can do this by finding the difference in the standard reduction potentials of the two half-reactions.\n\nThe balanced half-reactions are:\n\nFe3+(aq) + e- → Fe2+(aq)  E° = -0.037 V (reduction of Fe3+)\nI2(s) + 2e- → 2I-(aq)     E° = 0.535 V (reduction of I2)\n\nSince the Fe3+ half-reaction is being reduced and the I2 half-reaction is being oxidized, we need to reverse the I2 half-reaction and change the sign of its standard reduction potential:\n\n2I-(aq) → I2(s) + 2e-     E° = -0.535 V (oxidation of I-)\n\nNow, we can add the two half-reactions and their standard potentials to find the overall cell potential (E°):\n\n2Fe3+(aq) + 2I-(aq) → 2Fe2+(aq) + I2(s) + 2e- + 2e-\nE° = -0.037 V + (-0.535 V) = -0.572 V\n\nNext, we can use the Nernst equation to calculate the standard free energy change (ΔG°):\n\nΔG° = -nFE°\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of electrons transferred (in this case, 2), F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol), and E° is the overall cell potential.\n\nΔG° = -(2)(96,485 C/mol)(-0.572 V)\nΔG° = 110,533 J/mol\n\nSince the standard free energy change is usually expressed in kJ/mol, we can convert the value:\n\nΔG° = 110.533 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard free energy change (ΔG°) for the redox reaction at 298 K is 110.533 kJ/mol."
