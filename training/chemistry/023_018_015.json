    "message_2": "To calculate the yield of 2,4-dinitrophenol, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the limiting reactant.\n2. Calculate the theoretical yield.\n3. Apply the specific reaction conditions to find the actual yield.\n\nStep 1: Determine the limiting reactant\n\nFirst, we need to find the molecular weights of the reactants and product:\n\nPhenol (C6H5OH): 94.11 g/mol\nNitric acid (HNO3): 63.01 g/mol\n2,4-Dinitrophenol (C6H4N2O5): 184.11 g/mol\n\nNext, we need to determine the moles of each reactant:\n\nMoles of phenol = (10 g) / (94.11 g/mol) = 0.1063 mol\nMoles of nitric acid = (15 mL) * (1.51 g/mL) * (0.65) / (63.01 g/mol) = 0.0991 mol\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nC6H5OH + 2 HNO3 â†’ C6H4N2O5 + 2 H2O\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of phenol reacts with 2 moles of nitric acid. To find the limiting reactant, we can compare the mole ratio of the reactants:\n\nMole ratio of nitric acid to phenol = (0.0991 mol) / (0.1063 mol) = 0.932\n\nSince the mole ratio is less than 2, nitric acid is the limiting reactant.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the theoretical yield\n\nUsing the stoichiometry of the balanced equation, we can calculate the theoretical yield of 2,4-dinitrophenol:\n\nMoles of 2,4-dinitrophenol = (0.0991 mol nitric acid) * (1 mol 2,4-dinitrophenol / 2 mol nitric acid) = 0.04955 mol\n\nTheoretical yield = (0.04955 mol) * (184.11 g/mol) = 9.116 g\n\nStep 3: Apply the specific reaction conditions to find the actual yield\n\nSince we don't have any information about the specific reaction conditions or the percentage yield, we cannot calculate the actual yield. If you have information about the percentage yield, you can multiply the theoretical yield by the percentage yield to find the actual yield."
