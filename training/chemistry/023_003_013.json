    "message_2": "To determine the maximum yield of nylon-6,6 from the reaction of adipic acid and hexamethylenediamine, we need to consider the stoichiometry of the reaction. The reaction can be represented as follows:\n\nH2N-(CH2)6-NH2 + HOOC-(CH2)4-COOH â†’ [-NH-(CH2)6-NH-CO-(CH2)4-COO-]n + H2O\n\nHere, one molecule of hexamethylenediamine (H2N-(CH2)6-NH2) reacts with one molecule of adipic acid (HOOC-(CH2)4-COOH) to form one unit of nylon-6,6 ([-NH-(CH2)6-NH-CO-(CH2)4-COO-]n) and one molecule of water (H2O).\n\nAssuming complete conversion of the reactants, the maximum yield of nylon-6,6 will be equal to the amount of the limiting reactant. If both reactants are present in equimolar amounts, the maximum yield of nylon-6,6 will be equal to the amount of either reactant.\n\nTo calculate the yield in grams, you can use the molar masses of the reactants and the product:\n\nMolar mass of hexamethylenediamine = 116.21 g/mol\nMolar mass of adipic acid = 146.14 g/mol\nMolar mass of one unit of nylon-6,6 = 226.32 g/mol (excluding water)\n\nIf you know the amount of either reactant in moles or grams, you can calculate the maximum yield of nylon-6,6 in grams using the stoichiometry and molar masses."
