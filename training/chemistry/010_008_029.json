    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question for the student to solve:\n\nA copper electrode is placed in a solution containing 0.01 M Cu2+ ions and a platinum electrode is placed in a solution containing 0.1 M H+ ions. The two half-cells are connected by a salt bridge and an external wire. What is the current density in the cell at 25°C, given that the standard reduction potential of Cu2+/Cu is +0.34 V and that of H+/H2 is 0.00 V?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cell potential (E_cell) using the Nernst equation. The Nernst equation is given by:\n\nE_cell = E°_cell - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\n\nwhere E°_cell is the standard cell potential, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin (25°C = 298 K), n is the number of electrons transferred in the redox reaction, F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol), and Q is the reaction quotient.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the standard cell potential (E°_cell). This is the difference between the standard reduction potentials of the two half-reactions:\n\nE°_cell = E°_Cu2+/Cu - E°_H+/H2 = 0.34 V - 0.00 V = 0.34 V\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of electrons transferred in the redox reaction (n). The balanced half-reactions are:\n\nCu2+ + 2e- -> Cu (reduction)\n2H+ + 2e- -> H2 (oxidation)\n\nSince both half-reactions involve the transfer of 2 electrons, n = 2.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the reaction quotient (Q). For this redox reaction, Q is given by:\n\nQ = [Cu2+]^2 / [H+]^2 = (0.01)^2 / (0.1)^2 = 0.01\n\nNow we can plug all the values into the Nernst equation:\n\nE_cell = 0.34 V - (8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K / (2 * 96,485 C/mol)) * ln(0.01)\nE_cell ≈ 0.34 V - 0.029 V = 0.311 V\n\nThe current density (i) can be calculated using Ohm's law:\n\ni = E_cell / R_cell\n\nHowever, we do not have enough information to determine the cell resistance (R_cell) in this problem. Therefore, we cannot calculate the current density (i) without additional information."
