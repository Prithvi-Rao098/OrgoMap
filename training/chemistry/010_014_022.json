    "message_1": "A student conducted an electrolysis experiment using a current of 2 amperes for 30 minutes with a copper sulfate solution. What is the mass of copper deposited on the cathode? The atomic weight of copper is 63.546 g/mol and the Faraday constant is 96,485 C/mol.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the total charge passed through the solution during the electrolysis experiment. We can do this by multiplying the current (in amperes) by the time (in seconds).\n\nCurrent = 2 A\nTime = 30 minutes = 30 * 60 seconds = 1800 seconds\n\nTotal charge = Current × Time\nTotal charge = 2 A × 1800 s = 3600 Coulombs\n\nNext, we need to find the number of moles of electrons transferred during the experiment. We can do this by dividing the total charge by the Faraday constant.\n\nMoles of electrons = Total charge / Faraday constant\nMoles of electrons = 3600 C / 96,485 C/mol = 0.0373 mol\n\nCopper sulfate (CuSO4) undergoes electrolysis to produce copper (Cu) and sulfate ions (SO4^2-). The balanced half-reaction for the reduction of copper ions at the cathode is:\n\nCu^2+ + 2e- → Cu\n\nThis means that 2 moles of electrons are required to deposit 1 mole of copper. Now, we need to find the moles of copper deposited.\n\nMoles of copper = Moles of electrons / 2\nMoles of copper = 0.0373 mol / 2 = 0.01865 mol\n\nFinally, we can find the mass of copper deposited by multiplying the moles of copper by the atomic weight of copper.\n\nMass of copper = Moles of copper × Atomic weight of copper\nMass of copper = 0.01865 mol × 63.546 g/mol = 1.185 g\n\nSo, the mass of copper deposited on the cathode during the electrolysis experiment is approximately 1.185 grams."
