    "message_2": "Ribose sugar plays a crucial role in RNA transcription and translation, which are essential processes in protein synthesis. Ribose sugar is a key component of the RNA molecule, forming the backbone of the RNA structure along with phosphate groups. The ribose sugar in RNA has a hydroxyl group (-OH) at the 2' position, which distinguishes it from deoxyribose sugar found in DNA.\n\nThe structure of ribose sugar affects the function of RNA molecules in the protein synthesis process in several ways:\n\n1. Stability: The presence of the hydroxyl group at the 2' position in ribose sugar makes RNA less stable than DNA. This is because the hydroxyl group is more reactive, making RNA more susceptible to hydrolysis and degradation. This property of RNA is important because it allows for the rapid turnover of RNA molecules, ensuring that the cellular processes are dynamic and responsive to changing conditions.\n\n2. Flexibility: The additional hydroxyl group in ribose sugar provides RNA with more conformational flexibility compared to DNA. This flexibility allows RNA molecules to adopt various secondary and tertiary structures, which are essential for their diverse functions, including catalytic activities and specific binding to other molecules.\n\n3. Specificity in base pairing: The ribose sugar-phosphate backbone in RNA influences the specificity of base pairing during transcription and translation. The hydrogen bonding between the bases in RNA is crucial for the accurate transfer of genetic information from DNA to RNA during transcription and from RNA to proteins during translation.\n\n4. Participation in catalysis: In some RNA molecules, such as ribozymes and ribosomes, the ribose sugar plays a direct role in catalytic activities. For example, the 2'-OH group of ribose sugar in the peptidyl transferase center of the ribosome is involved in the formation of peptide bonds during protein synthesis.\n\nIn summary, the structure of ribose sugar in RNA is essential for the stability, flexibility, specificity, and catalytic activities of RNA molecules, which are crucial for the proper functioning of transcription and translation processes in protein synthesis."
