    "message_2": "To calculate the standard electrode potential for the given redox reaction, we need to consider the reduction and oxidation half-reactions:\n\n1. Oxidation half-reaction: Zn(s) → Zn²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ (Zn is oxidized)\nStandard electrode potential for Zn²⁺/Zn: E°(Zn) = -0.76V\n\n2. Reduction half-reaction: Cu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Cu(s) (Cu²⁺ is reduced)\nStandard electrode potential for Cu²⁺/Cu: E°(Cu) = +0.34V\n\nNow, to find the standard electrode potential for the overall redox reaction, we can use the formula:\n\nE°(cell) = E°(cathode) - E°(anode)\n\nIn this case, the Cu²⁺/Cu electrode is the cathode (reduction occurs), and the Zn²⁺/Zn electrode is the anode (oxidation occurs):\n\nE°(cell) = E°(Cu) - E°(Zn) = (+0.34V) - (-0.76V) = +0.34V + 0.76V = +1.10V\n\nSo, the standard electrode potential for the given redox reaction is +1.10V."
