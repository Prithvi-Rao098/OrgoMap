    "message_1": "What is the percent yield of magnesium oxide when 10.0 grams of magnesium is reacted with excess oxygen and 12.5 grams of magnesium oxide is produced? The theoretical yield of the reaction is 16.2 grams.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the percent yield of magnesium oxide, we can use the following formula:\n\nPercent Yield = (Actual Yield / Theoretical Yield) × 100\n\nIn this case, the actual yield is the amount of magnesium oxide produced, which is 12.5 grams. The theoretical yield is given as 16.2 grams.\n\nPercent Yield = (12.5 grams / 16.2 grams) × 100\n\nPercent Yield = 0.7716 × 100\n\nPercent Yield ≈ 77.16%\n\nThe percent yield of magnesium oxide in this reaction is approximately 77.16%."
