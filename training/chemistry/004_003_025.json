The compound has a molecular formula of C8H10O2 and a mass spectrum with a molecular ion peak at m/z 150 and base peak at m/z 77. Provide the structural formula of the compound and explain the fragmentation pattern observed in the mass spectrum.",
    "message_2": "To identify the unknown compound X, we will first analyze the given information and then deduce the possible structure based on the fragmentation pattern observed in the mass spectrum.\n\nGiven information:\n1. Molecular formula: C8H10O2\n2. Molecular ion peak (M+) at m/z 150\n3. Base peak at m/z 77\n\nThe molecular ion peak at m/z 150 confirms the molecular formula of the compound as C8H10O2. Now, let's analyze the base peak at m/z 77.\n\nA base peak at m/z 77 is characteristic of a benzyl cation (C7H7+). This suggests that the compound has a benzyl group attached to it. Since the molecular formula is C8H10O2, the remaining part of the molecule should be CH3O2 (methoxy group). Combining the benzyl group and the methoxy group, we can deduce the structure of the compound as follows:\n\nThe structural formula of the compound X is:\n\n      O\n       \"\nC6H5 - CH2 - O - CH3\n\nThis compound is known as Benzyl methyl ether.\n\nNow, let's explain the fragmentation pattern observed in the mass spectrum. The base peak at m/z 77 is formed by the cleavage of the C-O bond between the benzyl group and the methoxy group. This generates a stable benzyl cation (C7H7+) and a methoxy radical (CH3Oâ€¢). The benzyl cation is responsible for the base peak at m/z 77, while the molecular ion peak at m/z 150 corresponds to the intact compound.\n\nIn summary, the unknown compound X is Benzyl methyl ether, and its fragmentation pattern in the mass spectrum can be explained by the cleavage of the C-O bond between the benzyl and methoxy groups, generating a stable benzyl cation and a methoxy radical."
