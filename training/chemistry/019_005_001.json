    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the reaction of hydrogen gas (H2) and chlorine gas (Cl2) to form hydrochloric acid (2HCl) at standard conditions (298 K and 1 atm), we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG = ΔH - TΔS\n\nwhere ΔH is the change in enthalpy, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ΔS is the change in entropy.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) and standard entropy change (ΔS°) for the reaction. These values can be found in standard thermodynamic tables.\n\nFor the given reaction:\nH2(g) + Cl2(g) → 2HCl(g)\n\nThe standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) and standard entropy change (ΔS°) are as follows:\nΔH°(H2) = 0 kJ/mol (since it is an element in its standard state)\nΔH°(Cl2) = 0 kJ/mol (since it is an element in its standard state)\nΔH°(HCl) = -92.3 kJ/mol\n\nΔS°(H2) = 130.7 J/mol·K\nΔS°(Cl2) = 223.1 J/mol·K\nΔS°(HCl) = 186.8 J/mol·K\n\nNow, we can calculate the changes in enthalpy (ΔH) and entropy (ΔS) for the reaction:\nΔH = [2 * ΔH°(HCl)] - [ΔH°(H2) + ΔH°(Cl2)] = 2 * (-92.3) - (0 + 0) = -184.6 kJ/mol\n\nΔS = [2 * ΔS°(HCl)] - [ΔS°(H2) + ΔS°(Cl2)] = 2 * 186.8 - (130.7 + 223.1) = 373.6 - 353.8 = 19.8 J/mol·K\n\nNow, we can calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) at 298 K:\nΔG = ΔH - TΔS = -184.6 kJ/mol - (298 K * 19.8 J/mol·K / 1000 J/kJ) = -184.6 kJ/mol - 5.9 kJ/mol = -190.5 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the Gibbs free energy change for the reaction of hydrogen gas (H2) and chlorine gas (Cl2) to form hydrochloric acid (2HCl) at standard conditions (298 K and 1 atm) is -190.5 kJ/mol."
