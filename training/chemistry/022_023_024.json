    "message_2": "To find the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid (CH3COOH) with a Ka of 1.8 x 10⁻⁵, we can use the formula for the ionization constant of a weak acid:\n\nKa = [H+][A-]/[HA]\n\nWhere Ka is the ionization constant, [H+] is the concentration of hydrogen ions, [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base, and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid.\n\nIn this case, the initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.1 M. Since the ionization of acetic acid is very small, we can assume that the change in concentration of acetic acid is negligible. Therefore, [HA] ≈ 0.1 M.\n\nLet x be the concentration of hydrogen ions and acetate ions produced by the ionization of acetic acid:\n\nKa = [H+][A-]/[HA] = (x)(x)/(0.1) = x²/0.1\n\nNow, we can plug in the given Ka value:\n\n1.8 x 10⁻⁵ = x²/0.1\n\nSolve for x:\n\nx² = 1.8 x 10⁻⁵ * 0.1\nx² = 1.8 x 10⁻⁶\nx = √(1.8 x 10⁻⁶)\nx ≈ 1.34 x 10⁻³\n\nSince x represents the concentration of hydrogen ions [H+], we can now calculate the pH using the formula:\n\npH = -log[H+]\n\npH = -log(1.34 x 10⁻³)\npH ≈ 2.87\n\nTherefore, the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid (CH3COOH) with a Ka of 1.8 x 10⁻⁵ is approximately 2.87."
