    "message_2": "The nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction between acetic anhydride (CH3CO)2O and aniline (C6H5NH2) involves the following steps:\n\n1. Nucleophilic attack: The nitrogen atom in the aniline molecule, which has a lone pair of electrons, acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon atom in the acetic anhydride molecule. This results in the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate and the breaking of the Ï€ bond between the carbonyl carbon and oxygen atoms.\n\n2. Proton transfer: The negatively charged oxygen atom in the tetrahedral intermediate abstracts a proton from the nitrogen atom in the aniline molecule, forming a new N-H bond and regenerating the carbonyl double bond (C=O).\n\n3. Leaving group departure: The negatively charged oxygen atom in the acetate ion (CH3COO-) acts as a leaving group, breaking the bond between the carbonyl carbon and the oxygen atom. This results in the formation of an acylated aniline molecule (C6H5NHC(O)CH3) and an acetate ion (CH3COO-).\n\n4. Acid-base reaction (optional): If the reaction is carried out in the presence of an acid, the acylated aniline molecule can undergo an acid-base reaction with the acid, resulting in the protonation of the nitrogen atom and the formation of a more stable ammonium salt.\n\nOverall, the reaction between acetic anhydride and aniline results in the formation of N-acetylaniline (C6H5NHC(O)CH3) and an acetate ion (CH3COO-). The mechanism is a classic example of a nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction, where the nucleophile (aniline) substitutes the leaving group (acetate ion) in the acyl compound (acetic anhydride)."
