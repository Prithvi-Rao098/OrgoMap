    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change of ionization, we need to divide the heat absorbed by the number of moles of the substance.\n\nEnthalpy change of ionization (ΔH) = Heat absorbed (q) / Number of moles (n)\n\nΔH = 20 kJ / 0.1 mol\n\nΔH = 200 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change of ionization for the solution containing 0.1 mol of HCl (aq) is 200 kJ/mol."
