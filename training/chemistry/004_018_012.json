    "message_1": "A 15.0 g sample of a mixture containing sodium chloride and sodium nitrate is dissolved in water, and then silver nitrate is added until no more precipitation occurs. The mass of the precipitate is found to be 20.4 g. What is the mass percentage of each component in the mixture?",
    "message_2": "When silver nitrate is added to the mixture, it reacts with sodium chloride to form silver chloride precipitate. The reaction is as follows:\n\nAgNO3 + NaCl -> AgCl + NaNO3\n\nThe sodium nitrate does not react with silver nitrate and remains in the solution. The mass of the precipitate (20.4 g) is the mass of silver chloride formed. We can use the stoichiometry of the reaction to determine the mass of sodium chloride in the original mixture.\n\nFirst, we need to find the molar mass of each compound:\n- Sodium chloride (NaCl): 58.44 g/mol\n- Silver chloride (AgCl): 143.32 g/mol\n\nNow, we can use the mass of the precipitate (AgCl) to find the moles of AgCl formed:\nmoles of AgCl = mass of AgCl / molar mass of AgCl\nmoles of AgCl = 20.4 g / 143.32 g/mol = 0.1423 mol\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, the moles of NaCl in the original mixture are equal to the moles of AgCl formed:\nmoles of NaCl = 0.1423 mol\n\nNow, we can find the mass of NaCl in the original mixture:\nmass of NaCl = moles of NaCl * molar mass of NaCl\nmass of NaCl = 0.1423 mol * 58.44 g/mol = 8.32 g\n\nSince the total mass of the mixture is 15.0 g, the mass of sodium nitrate in the mixture can be found by subtracting the mass of sodium chloride:\nmass of NaNO3 = total mass - mass of NaCl\nmass of NaNO3 = 15.0 g - 8.32 g = 6.68 g\n\nFinally, we can find the mass percentage of each component in the mixture:\nmass percentage of NaCl = (mass of NaCl / total mass) * 100\nmass percentage of NaCl = (8.32 g / 15.0 g) * 100 = 55.47%\n\nmass percentage of NaNO3 = (mass of NaNO3 / total mass) * 100\nmass percentage of NaNO3 = (6.68 g / 15.0 g) * 100 = 44.53%\n\nSo, the mass percentage of sodium chloride in the mixture is 55.47%, and the mass percentage of sodium nitrate is 44.53%."
