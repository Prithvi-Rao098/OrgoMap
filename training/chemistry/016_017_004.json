    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change of the reaction, we can use the following formula:\n\nΔH_reaction = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH_f is the enthalpy of formation of the compounds.\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\nΔH_reaction = [1 × (-393.51 kJ/mol) + 2 × (-241.83 kJ/mol)] - [1 × (-74.87 kJ/mol) + 2 × 0 kJ/mol]\n\nNote that the enthalpy of formation of O2(g) is 0 kJ/mol since it is in its standard state.\n\nΔH_reaction = (-393.51 - 2 × 241.83 + 74.87) kJ/mol\nΔH_reaction = (-393.51 - 483.66 + 74.87) kJ/mol\nΔH_reaction = (-801.30 + 74.87) kJ/mol\nΔH_reaction = -726.43 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change of the oxidation of methane to carbon dioxide and water vapor is -726.43 kJ/mol."
