    "message_2": "To determine the rate law expression, we need to find the order of the reaction with respect to each reactant (NO and O2). We can do this by comparing the rates and concentrations of the reactants in the different experiments.\n\nLet's compare experiments 1 and 2, where the concentration of O2 is constant:\n\nRate2 / Rate1 = (1.9 x 10^-3 M/s) / (4.8 x 10^-4 M/s) = 3.958\n\n[NO]2 / [NO]1 = (0.20 M) / (0.10 M) = 2\n\nSince Rate2 / Rate1 ≈ ([NO]2 / [NO]1)^2, the reaction is second order with respect to NO.\n\nNow let's compare experiments 2 and 3, where the concentration of NO is constant:\n\nRate3 / Rate2 = (3.8 x 10^-3 M/s) / (1.9 x 10^-3 M/s) = 2\n\n[O2]3 / [O2]2 = (0.20 M) / (0.10 M) = 2\n\nSince Rate3 / Rate2 ≈ [O2]3 / [O2]2, the reaction is first order with respect to O2.\n\nThus, the rate law expression is:\n\nRate = k [NO]^2 [O2]\n\nNow we can determine the rate constant (k) using the data from any of the experiments. Let's use experiment 1:\n\n4.8 x 10^-4 M/s = k (0.10 M)^2 (0.10 M)\n\nk = (4.8 x 10^-4 M/s) / (0.01 M^3) = 4.8 x 10^-2 M^-2 s^-1\n\nFinally, we can calculate the rate of the reaction when [NO] = 0.15 M and [O2] = 0.15 M:\n\nRate = (4.8 x 10^-2 M^-2 s^-1) (0.15 M)^2 (0.15 M) = 1.944 x 10^-3 M/s\n\nSo, the rate of the reaction when [NO] = 0.15 M and [O2] = 0.15 M is 1.944 x 10^-3 M/s."
