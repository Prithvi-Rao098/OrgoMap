The equilibrium constant for the reaction 3H2(g) + N2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g) at this temperature is 2.5 x 10^-3.",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium concentrations of hydrogen gas (H2), nitrogen gas (N2), and ammonia gas (NH3), we can use the initial concentrations and the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction.\n\nInitial concentrations:\n[H2] = 4 moles / 2 L = 2 M\n[N2] = 2 moles / 2 L = 1 M\n[NH3] = 0 moles / 2 L = 0 M\n\nLet x be the change in concentration at equilibrium:\n[H2] = 2 - 3x\n[N2] = 1 - x\n[NH3] = 2x\n\nNow, we can use the equilibrium constant expression:\nKc = [NH3]^2 / ([H2]^3 * [N2])\n\nPlug in the equilibrium concentrations and the given Kc value:\n2.5 x 10^-3 = (2x)^2 / ((2 - 3x)^3 * (1 - x))\n\nThis is a cubic equation, which can be solved using numerical methods or software. Solving for x, we get:\nx ≈ 0.026\n\nNow, we can find the equilibrium concentrations:\n[H2] = 2 - 3x ≈ 2 - 3(0.026) ≈ 1.922 M\n[N2] = 1 - x ≈ 1 - 0.026 ≈ 0.974 M\n[NH3] = 2x ≈ 2(0.026) ≈ 0.052 M\n\nSo, the equilibrium concentrations are approximately:\n[H2] ≈ 1.922 M\n[N2] ≈ 0.974 M\n[NH3] ≈ 0.052 M"
