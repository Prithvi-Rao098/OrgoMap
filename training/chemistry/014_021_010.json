    "message_2": "Cytochrome c oxidase is a metalloenzyme that plays a crucial role in cellular respiration. The active site of this enzyme contains two metal ions: a copper ion (Cu) and a heme-bound iron ion (Fe). \n\nThe coordination geometry of the copper ion (CuB) in the active site is approximately tetrahedral. It is coordinated by three histidine nitrogen atoms and a nearby oxygen atom from a water molecule or hydroxide ion.\n\nThe heme-bound iron ion (Fe) in the active site has a distorted octahedral coordination geometry. It is coordinated by four nitrogen atoms from the porphyrin ring, one histidine nitrogen atom, and an oxygen atom from a water molecule or hydroxide ion.\n\nThe oxidation states of the metal ions in the active site of cytochrome c oxidase can vary during the catalytic cycle. The copper ion (CuB) can switch between Cu(I) and Cu(II) oxidation states, while the heme-bound iron ion (Fe) can switch between Fe(II) and Fe(III) oxidation states. These changes in oxidation states are essential for the enzyme's function in transferring electrons and reducing molecular oxygen to water."
