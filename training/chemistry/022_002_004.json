    "message_1": "A chemistry lab has 20 grams of magnesium and 30 grams of hydrochloric acid. What is the exact amount (in grams) of magnesium chloride that will be produced in a complete reaction between magnesium and hydrochloric acid?",
    "message_2": "To determine the amount of magnesium chloride produced, we need to use the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between magnesium and hydrochloric acid:\n\nMg (s) + 2 HCl (aq) → MgCl₂ (aq) + H₂ (g)\n\nFirst, we need to determine the limiting reactant. To do this, we'll use the molar masses of the reactants and the stoichiometry of the balanced equation.\n\nMolar mass of Mg = 24.31 g/mol\nMolar mass of HCl = 36.46 g/mol\n\nMoles of Mg = 20 g / 24.31 g/mol = 0.822 mol\nMoles of HCl = 30 g / 36.46 g/mol = 0.822 mol\n\nNow, we'll use the stoichiometry of the balanced equation to determine the limiting reactant:\n\nMoles of Mg needed for complete reaction with HCl = 0.822 mol HCl / 2 = 0.411 mol Mg\n\nSince we have 0.822 mol of Mg, there is enough Mg to react with all the HCl. Therefore, HCl is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow, we can determine the amount of magnesium chloride produced using the stoichiometry of the balanced equation:\n\nMoles of MgCl₂ produced = 0.822 mol HCl * (1 mol MgCl₂ / 2 mol HCl) = 0.411 mol MgCl₂\n\nFinally, we'll convert moles of MgCl₂ to grams:\n\nMolar mass of MgCl₂ = 95.21 g/mol\nMass of MgCl₂ = 0.411 mol MgCl₂ * 95.21 g/mol = 39.11 g\n\nSo, 39.11 grams of magnesium chloride will be produced in a complete reaction between magnesium and hydrochloric acid."
