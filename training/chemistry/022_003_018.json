    "message_2": "The balanced chemical equation for the reaction between hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is:\n\nHCl (aq) + NaOH (aq) → NaCl (aq) + H2O (l)\n\nThis is an acid-base neutralization reaction, and the stoichiometry is 1:1 for HCl and NaOH.\n\nTo calculate the number of moles of HCl needed for the reaction, we can use the given information about NaOH:\n\nVolume of NaOH = 25 mL = 0.025 L (converting mL to L)\nConcentration of NaOH = 0.1 M\n\nNumber of moles of NaOH = Volume × Concentration\nNumber of moles of NaOH = 0.025 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.0025 mol\n\nSince the stoichiometry is 1:1, the number of moles of HCl needed for the reaction is also 0.0025 mol."
