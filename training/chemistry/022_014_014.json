    "message_2": "To determine the limiting reactant and the mass of iron oxide produced, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\n4 Fe + 3 O2 → 2 Fe2O3\n\nNow, we'll calculate the moles of each reactant:\n\nMoles of iron (Fe) = mass / molar mass\nMoles of Fe = 10 g / 55.85 g/mol ≈ 0.179 moles\n\nMoles of oxygen (O2) = mass / molar mass\nMoles of O2 = 15 g / 32.00 g/mol ≈ 0.469 moles\n\nNext, we'll determine the mole ratio of iron to oxygen in the balanced equation:\n\nMole ratio (Fe:O2) = 4:3\n\nNow, we'll divide the moles of each reactant by their respective coefficients in the balanced equation to find which reactant is limiting:\n\nFe: 0.179 moles / 4 ≈ 0.045\nO2: 0.469 moles / 3 ≈ 0.156\n\nSince the value for iron (Fe) is smaller, it is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow, we'll use the stoichiometry of the balanced equation to determine the moles of iron oxide (Fe2O3) produced:\n\nMoles of Fe2O3 = (moles of limiting reactant) * (coefficient of Fe2O3 / coefficient of limiting reactant)\nMoles of Fe2O3 = (0.179 moles) * (2 / 4) ≈ 0.0895 moles\n\nFinally, we'll convert the moles of iron oxide to grams:\n\nMass of Fe2O3 = moles * molar mass\nMass of Fe2O3 = 0.0895 moles * 159.69 g/mol ≈ 14.3 g\n\nSo, the limiting reactant is iron (Fe), and the mass of iron oxide (Fe2O3) produced is approximately 14.3 grams."
