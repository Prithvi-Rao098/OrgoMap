    "message_2": "The balanced chemical equation for the preparation of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene from nitrobenzene and chlorine gas is:\n\nC6H5NO2 + 2 Cl2 → C6H3Cl2NO2 + 2 HCl\n\nTo calculate the theoretical yield, first determine the limiting reactant:\n\n1. Calculate the moles of nitrobenzene (C6H5NO2) and chlorine gas (Cl2) using their molar masses:\n\nMolar mass of nitrobenzene = 123.11 g/mol\nMoles of nitrobenzene = 10 g / 123.11 g/mol = 0.0812 mol\n\nMolar mass of chlorine gas = 70.90 g/mol\nMoles of chlorine gas = 15 g / 70.90 g/mol = 0.2115 mol\n\n2. Determine the limiting reactant by comparing the mole ratios:\n\nThe stoichiometric ratio of nitrobenzene to chlorine gas is 1:2. \n\nMole ratio of nitrobenzene to chlorine gas = 0.0812 mol / 0.2115 mol = 0.384\n\nSince 0.384 is less than the required stoichiometric ratio of 0.5 (1:2), nitrobenzene is the limiting reactant.\n\n3. Calculate the theoretical yield of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene (C6H3Cl2NO2):\n\nMoles of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene = moles of nitrobenzene (since the stoichiometric ratio is 1:1) = 0.0812 mol\n\nMolar mass of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene = 192.00 g/mol\n\nTheoretical yield = moles of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene × molar mass of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene = 0.0812 mol × 192.00 g/mol = 15.59 g\n\nSo, the theoretical yield of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene is 15.59 g."
