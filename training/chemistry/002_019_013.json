    "message_2": "Sodium chloride (NaCl), or common table salt, does not have a specific boiling point like a pure substance because it is an ionic compound. When heated, NaCl first dissolves in any trace of water present, and then it decomposes before reaching a boiling point.\n\nHowever, the melting point of NaCl is 801째C (1,474째F) at 1 atm pressure. If you were to heat NaCl in a closed system where it could not decompose, its boiling point would be around 1,465째C (2,669째F) under 1 atm pressure. Keep in mind that this value is not commonly used or observed in practice due to the decomposition of NaCl at high temperatures."
