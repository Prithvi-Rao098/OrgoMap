    "message_2": "To calculate the cell potential at standard conditions for the given electrochemical reaction, we first need to identify the reduction and oxidation half-reactions. \n\nThe given standard reduction potentials are:\nCu2+(aq) + 2e- -> Cu(s)  E° = +0.34 V (reduction)\nAg+(aq) + e- -> Ag(s)   E° = +0.80 V (reduction)\n\nIn the overall reaction, Cu(s) is being oxidized to Cu2+(aq), so we need to reverse the first half-reaction to get the oxidation half-reaction:\nCu(s) -> Cu2+(aq) + 2e-  E° = -0.34 V (oxidation)\n\nNow, we need to balance the electrons in both half-reactions. Since the second half-reaction involves only one electron, we need to multiply it by 2 to balance the electrons with the first half-reaction:\n2(Ag+(aq) + e- -> Ag(s))   E° = 2(+0.80 V) = +1.60 V (reduction)\n\nNow, we can add the two balanced half-reactions to get the overall reaction:\nCu(s) -> Cu2+(aq) + 2e-  E° = -0.34 V (oxidation)\n2Ag+(aq) + 2e- -> 2Ag(s)   E° = +1.60 V (reduction)\n----------------------------------------------\nCu(s) + 2Ag+(aq) -> 2Ag(s) + Cu2+(aq)\n\nFinally, we can calculate the cell potential (E°cell) at standard conditions by adding the standard potentials of the oxidation and reduction half-reactions:\nE°cell = E°(reduction) + E°(oxidation)\nE°cell = (+1.60 V) + (-0.34 V)\nE°cell = +1.26 V\n\nSo, the cell potential at standard conditions for the given electrochemical reaction is +1.26 V."
