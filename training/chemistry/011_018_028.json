    "message_2": "When the concentration of chiral additives is increased during Monte Carlo simulations, the orientational ordering of liquid crystal molecules is affected in several ways. Chiral additives are molecules that possess a chiral center, meaning they have a non-superimposable mirror image. When added to liquid crystals, these additives can induce chirality and influence the orientational ordering of the liquid crystal molecules.\n\n1. Induction of chiral nematic phase: As the concentration of chiral additives increases, the liquid crystal mixture may transition from a nematic phase to a chiral nematic (or cholesteric) phase. In the chiral nematic phase, the liquid crystal molecules exhibit a helical arrangement, with the director (average orientation of the molecules) rotating along the helical axis. This helical structure is a direct result of the chiral additives' influence on the orientational ordering of the liquid crystal molecules.\n\n2. Pitch length variation: The pitch length, which is the distance over which the director completes one full rotation in the helical structure, can be affected by the concentration of chiral additives. As the concentration of chiral additives increases, the pitch length typically decreases. This is because the chiral additives promote a tighter helical arrangement of the liquid crystal molecules.\n\n3. Enhanced chirality: The presence of chiral additives can also enhance the chirality of the liquid crystal mixture. As the concentration of chiral additives increases, the overall chirality of the mixture becomes more pronounced, leading to stronger chiral interactions between the liquid crystal molecules and a more distinct helical structure.\n\n4. Changes in phase transition temperatures: The addition of chiral additives can also affect the phase transition temperatures of the liquid crystal mixture. As the concentration of chiral additives increases, the temperatures at which the mixture transitions between different phases (such as isotropic, nematic, and chiral nematic) may shift. This can be attributed to the chiral additives' influence on the orientational ordering and intermolecular interactions within the liquid crystal mixture.\n\nIn summary, increasing the concentration of chiral additives during Monte Carlo simulations can lead to the induction of a chiral nematic phase, variation in pitch length, enhanced chirality, and changes in phase transition temperatures. These effects are a result of the chiral additives' influence on the orientational ordering of the liquid crystal molecules."
