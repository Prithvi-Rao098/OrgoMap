    "message_2": "The predicted molecular geometry of a molecule with the chemical formula CO2 (carbon dioxide) is linear. This is because the central carbon atom is bonded to two oxygen atoms, and there are no lone pairs on the central atom. The bond angle between the oxygen atoms is 180 degrees, resulting in a linear shape."
