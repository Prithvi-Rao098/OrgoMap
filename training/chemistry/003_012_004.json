    "message_2": "To calculate the diffusion coefficient of oxygen gas in air at a given temperature and pressure, we can use the Chapman-Enskog equation, which is a semi-empirical formula for estimating diffusion coefficients in gases. The equation is as follows:\n\nD = (3.0 × 10^(-7) × T^(3/2)) / (P × (M1^(1/3) + M2^(1/3))^2)\n\nwhere:\nD = diffusion coefficient (m^2/s)\nT = temperature (K)\nP = pressure (atm)\nM1 and M2 = molar masses of the two gases (kg/mol)\n\nFor oxygen gas in air, we can assume that air is primarily composed of nitrogen gas (N2). The molar masses of O2 and N2 are 32 g/mol and 28 g/mol, respectively. We need to convert these values to kg/mol:\n\nM1 (O2) = 32 g/mol × (1 kg / 1000 g) = 0.032 kg/mol\nM2 (N2) = 28 g/mol × (1 kg / 1000 g) = 0.028 kg/mol\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values for temperature and pressure:\n\nT = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\nP = 1 atm\n\nD = (3.0 × 10^(-7) × (298.15^(3/2))) / (1 × (0.032^(1/3) + 0.028^(1/3))^2)\n\nD ≈ 2.12 × 10^(-5) m^2/s\n\nSo, the diffusion coefficient of oxygen gas in air at 25°C and 1 atm pressure is approximately 2.12 × 10^(-5) m^2/s."
