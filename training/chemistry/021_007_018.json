    "message_2": "To calculate the formal charge of oxygen in SO2, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the number of valence electrons for each atom.\n2. Calculate the number of electrons assigned to each atom in the molecule.\n3. Subtract the assigned electrons from the valence electrons to find the formal charge.\n\nStep 1: Determine the number of valence electrons for each atom.\n- Sulfur (S) is in group 16, so it has 6 valence electrons.\n- Oxygen (O) is also in group 16, so it has 6 valence electrons.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of electrons assigned to each atom in the molecule.\nSO2 has a sulfur atom double bonded to one oxygen atom and single bonded to another oxygen atom. In a double bond, there are 4 shared electrons, and in a single bond, there are 2 shared electrons.\n\n- For the double-bonded oxygen atom: 2 (from the double bond) + 4 (non-bonding electrons) = 6 assigned electrons\n- For the single-bonded oxygen atom: 1 (from the single bond) + 6 (non-bonding electrons) = 7 assigned electrons\n\nStep 3: Subtract the assigned electrons from the valence electrons to find the formal charge.\n- Formal charge of double-bonded oxygen: 6 (valence electrons) - 6 (assigned electrons) = 0\n- Formal charge of single-bonded oxygen: 6 (valence electrons) - 7 (assigned electrons) = -1\n\nIn the SO2 molecule, the formal charge of the double-bonded oxygen atom is 0, and the formal charge of the single-bonded oxygen atom is -1."
