    "message_2": "Copper (II) sulfate is an inorganic solid that is classified as an ionic compound. It has the chemical formula CuSO4, where copper (Cu) has a +2 charge and the sulfate ion (SO4) has a -2 charge. \n\nThe properties that can be used to identify its classification as an ionic compound are:\n\n1. Formation: Copper (II) sulfate is formed by the electrostatic attraction between the positively charged copper (II) cation (Cu2+) and the negatively charged sulfate anion (SO4²-).\n\n2. High melting and boiling points: Ionic compounds generally have high melting and boiling points due to the strong electrostatic forces between the ions. Copper (II) sulfate has a melting point of 110°C (230°F) and decomposes at higher temperatures.\n\n3. Solubility in water: Ionic compounds are usually soluble in polar solvents like water. Copper (II) sulfate is highly soluble in water, forming a blue solution.\n\n4. Conductivity: Ionic compounds conduct electricity when dissolved in water or in the molten state. This is because the ions are free to move and carry the electric charge. Aqueous solutions of copper (II) sulfate can conduct electricity.\n\n5. Crystal structure: Ionic compounds form crystal lattices due to the regular arrangement of cations and anions. Copper (II) sulfate forms a triclinic crystal structure.\n\nThese properties distinguish copper (II) sulfate as an ionic compound rather than a covalent or metallic compound."
