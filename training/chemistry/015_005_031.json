    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the reaction NH3(g) + HCl(g) → NH4Cl(s) at standard conditions (298 K and 1 atm), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) and standard entropy change (ΔS°) for the reaction.\n2. Use the Gibbs free energy equation: ΔG = ΔH - TΔS, where T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nStep 1: Determine ΔH° and ΔS°\nTo determine the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) and standard entropy change (ΔS°) for the reaction, we need to use the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) and standard molar entropies (S°) of the reactants and products. These values can be found in standard thermodynamic tables or calculated using quantum chemistry calculations.\n\nFor this problem, we will assume that the values are given as follows (in kJ/mol for ΔHf° and J/mol·K for S°):\n\nNH3(g): ΔHf° = -45.9 kJ/mol, S° = 192.5 J/mol·K\nHCl(g): ΔHf° = -92.3 kJ/mol, S° = 186.9 J/mol·K\nNH4Cl(s): ΔHf° = -314.4 kJ/mol, S° = 94.6 J/mol·K\n\nNow, we can calculate ΔH° and ΔS° for the reaction:\n\nΔH° = [ΔHf°(NH4Cl) - ΔHf°(NH3) - ΔHf°(HCl)] = [-314.4 - (-45.9) - (-92.3)] kJ/mol = -176.2 kJ/mol\n\nΔS° = [S°(NH4Cl) - S°(NH3) - S°(HCl)] = [94.6 - 192.5 - 186.9] J/mol·K = -284.8 J/mol·K\n\nStep 2: Calculate ΔG using the Gibbs free energy equation\nNow that we have ΔH° and ΔS°, we can calculate ΔG using the Gibbs free energy equation:\n\nΔG = ΔH - TΔS\n\nAt standard conditions, T = 298 K. Make sure to convert ΔS° to kJ/mol·K by dividing by 1000:\n\nΔG = (-176.2 kJ/mol) - (298 K × -284.8 J/mol·K / 1000) = -176.2 kJ/mol + 84.9 kJ/mol = -91.3 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the reaction NH3(g) + HCl(g) → NH4Cl(s) at standard conditions (298 K and 1 atm) is -91.3 kJ/mol."
