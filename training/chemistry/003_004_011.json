    "message_2": "The standard reduction potential of a silver electrode in contact with a 1 M silver ion solution at 25°C is given as +0.80 V. This is because the standard reduction potential is defined for a half-cell with a 1 M concentration of the ion at 25°C.\n\nTo calculate the electromotive force (EMF) of the cell formed by combining this silver electrode with a standard hydrogen electrode, we need to know the standard reduction potential of the hydrogen electrode. By definition, the standard reduction potential of the hydrogen electrode is 0 V.\n\nThe EMF of the cell (E_cell) can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nE_cell = E_cathode - E_anode\n\nIn this case, the silver electrode will act as the cathode (reduction occurs) and the hydrogen electrode will act as the anode (oxidation occurs). Therefore, we can plug in the values:\n\nE_cell = (+0.80 V) - (0 V)\n\nE_cell = +0.80 V\n\nThe electromotive force of the cell formed by combining the silver electrode with a standard hydrogen electrode is +0.80 V."
