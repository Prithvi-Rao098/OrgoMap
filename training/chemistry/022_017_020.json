    "message_2": "To calculate the ΔHrxn for the combustion of methane gas (CH4) using Hess's Law, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the combustion reaction:\n\nCH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(l)\n\nNow, we can use Hess's Law, which states that the enthalpy change of a reaction (ΔHrxn) is equal to the sum of the enthalpy changes of formation (ΔHf) of the products minus the sum of the enthalpy changes of formation of the reactants:\n\nΔHrxn = [ΔHf(CO2) + 2ΔHf(H2O)] - [ΔHf(CH4) + 2ΔHf(O2)]\n\nSince O2 is an element in its standard state, its enthalpy of formation is zero:\n\nΔHf(O2) = 0\n\nNow, we can plug in the given enthalpy values:\n\nΔHrxn = [(-393.5) + 2(-285.8)] - [(-74.8) + 2(0)]\n\nΔHrxn = (-393.5 - 571.6) - (-74.8)\n\nΔHrxn = -965.1 + 74.8\n\nΔHrxn = -890.3 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the ΔHrxn for the combustion of methane gas (CH4) is -890.3 kJ/mol."
