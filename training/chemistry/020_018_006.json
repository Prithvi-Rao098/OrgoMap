    "message_1": "If the equilibrium constant (K) for the reaction between a metal ion and a ligand (L) to form a complex ion (ML) is 1.2 × 10^6 and the initial concentration of the metal ion is 0.005 M and the ligand is 0.01 M, what will be the concentrations of the metal ion, ligand, and complex ion at equilibrium when the concentration of the ligand is doubled to 0.02 M?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to write the equilibrium expression for the reaction:\n\nM + L <=> ML\n\nK = [ML] / ([M] × [L])\n\nGiven that K = 1.2 × 10^6, initial [M] = 0.005 M, and initial [L] = 0.01 M, we can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the equilibrium concentrations:\n\n          [M]      [L]      [ML]\nInitial   0.005    0.01      0\nChange   -x       -x        +x\nEquil.   0.005-x  0.01-x    x\n\nNow, we can plug these equilibrium concentrations into the equilibrium expression:\n\n1.2 × 10^6 = x / ((0.005 - x) × (0.01 - x))\n\nSolving for x, we find that x ≈ 0.00498 M, which means that the equilibrium concentrations are:\n\n[M] ≈ 0.005 - 0.00498 ≈ 0.00002 M\n[L] ≈ 0.01 - 0.00498 ≈ 0.00502 M\n[ML] ≈ 0.00498 M\n\nNow, we need to find the new equilibrium concentrations when the initial concentration of the ligand is doubled to 0.02 M:\n\n          [M]      [L]      [ML]\nInitial   0.005    0.02      0\nChange   -y       -y        +y\nEquil.   0.005-y  0.02-y    y\n\nWe can use the same equilibrium expression:\n\n1.2 × 10^6 = y / ((0.005 - y) × (0.02 - y))\n\nSolving for y, we find that y ≈ 0.004995 M, which means that the new equilibrium concentrations are:\n\n[M] ≈ 0.005 - 0.004995 ≈ 0.000005 M\n[L] ≈ 0.02 - 0.004995 ≈ 0.015005 M\n[ML] ≈ 0.004995 M\n\nSo, when the concentration of the ligand is doubled to 0.02 M, the equilibrium concentrations are approximately:\n\n[M] ≈ 0.000005 M\n[L] ≈ 0.015005 M\n[ML] ≈ 0.004995 M"
