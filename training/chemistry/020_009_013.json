    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g), we first need to determine the changes in the concentrations of the reactants and products at equilibrium. Let's denote the change in concentration for N2 as x, for H2 as 3x, and for NH3 as 2x.\n\nAt equilibrium, the concentrations will be:\n[N2] = 0.1 - x\n[H2] = 0.2 - 3x\n[NH3] = 0.3 + 2x\n\nThe expression for the equilibrium constant Kc is given by:\n\nKc = [NH3]^2 / ([N2] * [H2]^3)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of x. Since we don't have the value of Kc, we cannot directly solve for x. However, we can provide the expression for Kc in terms of x:\n\nKc = [(0.3 + 2x)^2] / ([(0.1 - x) * (0.2 - 3x)^3])\n\nTo find the exact value of Kc, you would need additional information, such as the initial concentrations at a different temperature or the value of Kc at 400°C."
