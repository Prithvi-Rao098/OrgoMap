    "message_1": "What is the activation energy of the following electrochemical reaction given the temperature at which it occurs? \n\n2Fe^2+(aq) + H2O2(aq) -> 2Fe^3+(aq) + 2OH^-(aq) \n\n(the temperature value and other necessary information for the calculation will be given in the problem statement)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the activation energy of the given electrochemical reaction, we need the temperature, the rate constant (k), and the pre-exponential factor (A) or the Arrhenius equation. The Arrhenius equation is:\n\nk = A * e^(-Ea / RT)\n\nwhere:\nk = rate constant\nA = pre-exponential factor\nEa = activation energy\nR = gas constant (8.314 J/molÂ·K)\nT = temperature in Kelvin\n\nPlease provide the temperature, rate constant, and pre-exponential factor for the given reaction so that the activation energy can be calculated."
