    "message_2": "To calculate the theoretical yield of acetylsalicylic acid, we first need to determine the limiting reagent in the reaction. We will do this by comparing the moles of each reactant.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the synthesis of acetylsalicylic acid is:\n\nC7H6O3 (salicylic acid) + C4H6O3 (acetic anhydride) â†’ C9H8O4 (acetylsalicylic acid) + C2H4O2 (acetic acid)\n\nFirst, we need to find the molar mass of each reactant:\n\nSalicylic acid (C7H6O3): (7 * 12.01) + (6 * 1.01) + (3 * 16.00) = 138.12 g/mol\nAcetic anhydride (C4H6O3): (4 * 12.01) + (6 * 1.01) + (3 * 16.00) = 102.09 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the moles of each reactant:\n\nMoles of salicylic acid = 3 g / 138.12 g/mol = 0.0217 mol\nMoles of acetic anhydride = 5 g / 102.09 g/mol = 0.0489 mol\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, we can see that salicylic acid is the limiting reagent.\n\nNow, we can calculate the theoretical yield of acetylsalicylic acid (C9H8O4). First, we need to find its molar mass:\n\nAcetylsalicylic acid (C9H8O4): (9 * 12.01) + (8 * 1.01) + (4 * 16.00) = 180.16 g/mol\n\nThe theoretical yield is based on the moles of the limiting reagent (salicylic acid):\n\nTheoretical yield = 0.0217 mol * 180.16 g/mol = 3.91 g\n\nSo, the theoretical yield of acetylsalicylic acid is 3.91 grams, assuming complete conversion and 100% efficiency."
