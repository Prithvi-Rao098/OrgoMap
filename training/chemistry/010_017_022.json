    "message_2": "To calculate the corrosion rate, we need to determine the loss of mass per unit area per unit time. First, let's find the surface area of the copper wire.\n\n1. Calculate the volume of the lost copper mass:\nCopper has a density of 8.96 g/cm³. To find the volume, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = Mass / Density\nVolume = 3 g / 8.96 g/cm³ ≈ 0.335 cm³\n\n2. Calculate the surface area of the corroded copper:\nSince the wire is 5mm thick, we can assume it has a cylindrical shape. The corroded volume can be considered as a thin layer removed from the surface of the cylinder. The volume of a cylinder is given by:\n\nVolume = π * r² * h\n\nWhere r is the radius and h is the height (length) of the cylinder. We can rewrite the formula to find the height (length) of the corroded layer:\n\nh = Volume / (π * r²)\n\nLet r1 be the initial radius and r2 be the final radius after corrosion. The corroded volume can be represented as the difference between the volumes of two cylinders:\n\n0.335 cm³ = π * (r1² * h - r2² * h)\n\nSince the thickness of the wire is 5mm (0.5 cm), we can write:\n\nr1 - r2 = 0.5 cm\n\nNow, we have two equations and two unknowns (r1 and h). We can solve for r1 and h using these equations:\n\n0.335 cm³ = π * (r1² * h - (r1 - 0.5)² * h)\nr1 - r2 = 0.5 cm\n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n\nr1 ≈ 0.292 cm\nh ≈ 2.45 cm\n\n3. Calculate the surface area of the corroded copper:\nThe surface area of a cylinder is given by:\n\nSurface Area = 2 * π * r * h\n\nUsing the final radius (r2 = r1 - 0.5) and the height (h) we found:\n\nSurface Area ≈ 2 * π * 0.292 cm * 2.45 cm ≈ 4.49 cm²\n\n4. Calculate the corrosion rate:\nNow that we have the surface area, we can calculate the corrosion rate as the mass loss per unit area per unit time:\n\nCorrosion Rate = (Mass Loss) / (Surface Area * Time)\nCorrosion Rate = (3 g) / (4.49 cm² * 10 days) ≈ 0.067 g/cm²/day\n\nThe corrosion rate of the 5mm thick copper wire exposed to a 20% NaCl solution at 25°C is approximately 0.067 g/cm²/day."
