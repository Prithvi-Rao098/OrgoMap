    "message_2": "To calculate the formal charge of the nitrogen atom in HNO₃, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the number of valence electrons for nitrogen. Nitrogen is in group 15, so it has 5 valence electrons.\n\n2. Calculate the number of bonding electrons. In HNO₃, nitrogen forms two single bonds (one with hydrogen and one with oxygen) and one double bond (with another oxygen). Each single bond has 2 electrons, and the double bond has 4 electrons. So, there are 2 + 2 + 4 = 8 bonding electrons.\n\n3. Calculate the number of non-bonding electrons. Nitrogen has no lone pairs in HNO₃, so there are 0 non-bonding electrons.\n\n4. Calculate the formal charge using the formula: Formal charge = Valence electrons - (Bonding electrons/2) - Non-bonding electrons\n\nFormal charge of nitrogen = 5 - (8/2) - 0 = 5 - 4 = +1\n\nSo, the formal charge of the nitrogen atom in HNO₃ is +1."
