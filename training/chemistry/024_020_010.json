    "message_2": "To design a cost-effective and high-performance system for the production of water-based interior wall paints with low VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds) emissions, you will need to consider the following key components and their required amounts:\n\n1. Binder (15-25% by weight): Acrylic or vinyl-acrylic emulsion polymers are commonly used as binders in water-based paints due to their excellent adhesion, water resistance, and low VOC content. The binder is responsible for providing film formation, adhesion, and durability to the paint.\n\n2. Pigments (10-30% by weight): Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is the primary pigment used in interior wall paints for its excellent hiding power and whiteness. Other pigments, such as calcium carbonate, talc, and clay, can be used as fillers to reduce the cost and improve the paint's rheological properties.\n\n3. Water (40-60% by weight): Water is the primary solvent in water-based paints, responsible for reducing the viscosity of the paint and allowing it to be applied easily. The amount of water used can be adjusted to achieve the desired consistency and application properties.\n\n4. Coalescing agents (1-5% by weight): These are low-VOC solvents that help in the film formation process by softening the binder particles and allowing them to coalesce into a continuous film. Common coalescing agents include glycol ethers, such as propylene glycol n-butyl ether (PnB) and ethylene glycol n-butyl ether (EGBE).\n\n5. Rheology modifiers (0.1-2% by weight): These additives are used to adjust the paint's viscosity and flow properties. Common rheology modifiers include hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), hydrophobically modified ethoxylated urethane (HEUR), and associative thickeners.\n\n6. Dispersing agents (0.1-1% by weight): These additives help to stabilize the pigment dispersion and prevent the pigments from settling or flocculating. Common dispersing agents include sodium polyacrylates, polyphosphates, and polymeric dispersants.\n\n7. Biocides (0.05-0.5% by weight): These are added to prevent microbial growth in the paint, both during storage and after application. Common biocides include isothiazolinones, carbamates, and formaldehyde-releasing agents.\n\n8. Defoamers (0.01-0.5% by weight): These additives help to control foam formation during the paint manufacturing process and application. Common defoamers include mineral oil-based defoamers, silicone-based defoamers, and polyether-based defoamers.\n\n9. Surfactants (0.1-1% by weight): These additives help to improve the wetting and leveling properties of the paint. Common surfactants include nonionic surfactants, such as alkylphenol ethoxylates and alcohol ethoxylates, and anionic surfactants, such as alkylbenzene sulfonates and phosphate esters.\n\n10. Preservatives (0.05-0.2% by weight): These are added to protect the paint from spoilage due to bacterial or fungal contamination. Common preservatives include sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, and methylisothiazolinone.\n\nThe exact formulation and amounts of each component will depend on the specific performance requirements, such as hiding power, gloss, durability, and VOC content. It is essential to optimize the formulation through laboratory testing and adjust the amounts of each component to achieve the desired properties while minimizing the cost."
