Assume that the heat of combustion is representative of the enthalpy of formation.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change of isomerization for the conversion of cis-2-butene to trans-2-butene, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH_isomerization = ΔH_f(trans-2-butene) - ΔH_f(cis-2-butene)\n\nSince the heat of combustion is representative of the enthalpy of formation, we can use the given values:\n\nΔH_isomerization = (-3336.8 kJ/mol) - (-3283.1 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH_isomerization = -53.7 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change of isomerization for the conversion of cis-2-butene to trans-2-butene is -53.7 kJ/mol."
