    "message_1": "What will be the effect on the equilibrium concentration of product and reactant if we increase the temperature of the system in a reversible exothermic reaction?",
    "message_2": "In a reversible exothermic reaction, heat is released as the reaction proceeds in the forward direction. According to Le Chatelier's principle, when a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in temperature, the system will adjust itself to counteract the change and re-establish equilibrium.\n\nIf the temperature of the system is increased, the equilibrium will shift in the direction that absorbs the excess heat, which is the endothermic (reverse) direction. As a result, the concentration of reactants will increase, and the concentration of products will decrease. This shift in equilibrium will continue until a new equilibrium is established at the higher temperature."
