Use the formula for calculating bond length based on the bond angle and distance between nuclei.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the bond length between two carbon atoms in ethene, we can use the formula based on the bond angle and distance between nuclei:\n\nBond length = Distance between nuclei * sin(Bond angle / 2)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the bond angle from degrees to radians:\n\n121.7 degrees * (π / 180) ≈ 2.123 radians\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nBond length = 1.33 Å * sin(2.123 / 2)\nBond length ≈ 1.33 Å * sin(1.0615)\nBond length ≈ 1.33 Å * 0.874\n\nBond length ≈ 1.16 Å\n\nSo, the bond length between the two carbon atoms in ethene is approximately 1.16 angstroms."
