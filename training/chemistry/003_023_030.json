    "message_2": "To calculate the heat released or absorbed in this reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nq = n * ΔH\n\nwhere q is the heat released or absorbed, n is the number of moles of the substance, and ΔH is the enthalpy change per mole.\n\nIn this case, the balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\n2 H₂(g) + O₂(g) → 2 H₂O(g)\n\nThe enthalpy change (ΔH) for this reaction is given as -483.7 kJ/mol. Since 2 moles of hydrogen gas (H₂) react with 1 mole of oxygen gas (O₂) to form 2 moles of water vapor (H₂O), we can calculate the heat released or absorbed (q) as follows:\n\nq = n * ΔH\nq = 2 moles * (-483.7 kJ/mol)\nq = -967.4 kJ\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the reaction is exothermic, meaning that heat is released during the reaction. Therefore, the heat released when 2 moles of hydrogen gas reacts with 1 mole of oxygen gas to form 2 moles of water vapor at constant volume is 967.4 kJ."
