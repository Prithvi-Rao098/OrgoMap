    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (K) for the given reaction, we first need to determine the standard cell potential (E°) for the reaction. The standard cell potential can be calculated using the standard reduction potentials of the two half-reactions involved.\n\nThe half-reactions are:\n\n1. Ag+(aq) + e- → Ag(s) with E° = 0.80 V\n2. Ni2+(aq) + 2e- → Ni(s) with E° = -0.25 V\n\nThe overall reaction is:\n\n2Ag+(aq) + Ni(s) → 2Ag(s) + Ni2+(aq)\n\nTo obtain this reaction, we need to multiply the first half-reaction by 2 and reverse the second half-reaction:\n\n1. 2(Ag+(aq) + e- → Ag(s)) with E° = 2(0.80 V) = 1.60 V\n2. Ni(s) → Ni2+(aq) + 2e- with E° = -(-0.25 V) = 0.25 V\n\nNow, we can add the two half-reactions and their potentials:\n\n2Ag+(aq) + Ni(s) → 2Ag(s) + Ni2+(aq) with E° = 1.60 V + 0.25 V = 1.85 V\n\nNow that we have the standard cell potential (E°), we can use the Nernst equation to find the equilibrium constant (K). The Nernst equation is:\n\nE° = (RT/nF) * ln(K)\n\nWhere:\n- E° is the standard cell potential (1.85 V)\n- R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\n- T is the temperature in Kelvin (assuming 298 K, standard conditions)\n- n is the number of moles of electrons transferred (2 moles in this case)\n- F is the Faraday constant (96485 C/mol)\n\nRearranging the Nernst equation to solve for K:\n\nK = exp(nFE°/RT)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nK = exp(2 * 96485 C/mol * 1.85 V / (8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K))\n\nK = exp(36.42)\n\nK ≈ 1.33 × 10^16\n\nThe equilibrium constant (K) for the given reaction is approximately 1.33 × 10^16."
