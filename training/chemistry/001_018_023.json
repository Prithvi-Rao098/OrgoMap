    "message_2": "The pKa value of acetic acid is 4.76. To calculate the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log ([A-]/[HA])\n\nIn this case, [HA] is the concentration of acetic acid (0.1 M), and [A-] is the concentration of acetate ions. Since we don't know the concentration of acetate ions, we can use the ionization constant (Ka) of acetic acid to find it. The Ka of acetic acid is 10^(-pKa) = 10^(-4.76) ≈ 1.74 x 10^(-5).\n\nLet x be the concentration of acetate ions ([A-]) and acetic acid that ionizes. Then, the ionization equation is:\n\nKa = (x)(x) / (0.1 - x)\n\n1.74 x 10^(-5) = x^2 / (0.1 - x)\n\nSolving for x, we get x ≈ 1.33 x 10^(-3) M. This is the concentration of acetate ions and the amount of acetic acid that ionizes.\n\nNow we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = 4.76 + log (1.33 x 10^(-3) / (0.1 - 1.33 x 10^(-3)))\npH ≈ 2.87\n\nThe pH of the 0.1 M solution of acetic acid is approximately 2.87.\n\nTo find the percent ionization of acetic acid in this solution, we can use the following formula:\n\nPercent ionization = (concentration of ionized acetic acid / initial concentration of acetic acid) x 100\n\nPercent ionization = (1.33 x 10^(-3) / 0.1) x 100 ≈ 1.33%\n\nThe percent ionization of acetic acid in this 0.1 M solution is approximately 1.33%."
