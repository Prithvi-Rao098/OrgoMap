    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy change for the sublimation of iodine (I2) at 1 atm and 298 K, we can use the given information:\n\nI2(s) → I2(g)         ΔH° = 62.44 kJ/mol\n\nThis is the standard enthalpy change for the sublimation of iodine directly from solid to gas phase. The other given reaction is not relevant to the sublimation process:\n\nI2(s) → 2I(g)          ΔH° = 1519.9 kJ/mol\n\nThis reaction represents the dissociation of solid iodine into individual iodine atoms in the gas phase, which is not the same as sublimation.\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change for the sublimation of iodine at 1 atm and 298 K is:\n\nΔH° = 62.44 kJ/mol"
