    "message_2": "To find the mass percent of iron (Fe) in a 10.0 gram sample of iron oxide (Fe2O3) using gravimetric analysis techniques, we first need to determine the molar mass of Fe2O3 and the molar mass of Fe.\n\nThe molar mass of Fe is approximately 55.85 g/mol, and the molar mass of O is approximately 16.00 g/mol.\n\nNow, we can calculate the molar mass of Fe2O3:\nFe2O3 = (2 × 55.85 g/mol) + (3 × 16.00 g/mol) = 111.70 g/mol + 48.00 g/mol = 159.70 g/mol\n\nNext, we need to find the mass of iron (Fe) in the 10.0 gram sample of iron oxide (Fe2O3). To do this, we can use the mass percent formula:\n\nmass percent = (mass of component / total mass) × 100\n\nIn this case, the mass of the component is the mass of iron (Fe) in the sample, and the total mass is the mass of the iron oxide (Fe2O3) sample, which is 10.0 grams.\n\nFirst, we need to find the mole ratio of Fe to Fe2O3. In the chemical formula Fe2O3, there are 2 moles of Fe for every 1 mole of Fe2O3. Therefore, the mole ratio is 2:1.\n\nNow, we can use the mole ratio to find the mass of iron (Fe) in the 10.0 gram sample of iron oxide (Fe2O3):\n\n10.0 g Fe2O3 × (2 moles Fe / 1 mole Fe2O3) × (55.85 g Fe / 1 mole Fe) = 6.975 g Fe\n\nFinally, we can calculate the mass percent of iron (Fe) in the sample:\n\nmass percent = (6.975 g Fe / 10.0 g Fe2O3) × 100 = 69.75%\n\nSo, the mass percent of iron (Fe) in a 10.0 gram sample of iron oxide (Fe2O3) using gravimetric analysis techniques is approximately 69.75%."
