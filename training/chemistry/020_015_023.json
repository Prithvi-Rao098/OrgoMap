    "message_2": "The addition of a strong base to a solution containing a weak acid, such as acetic acid, will result in a reaction between the weak acid and the strong base. This reaction will produce a salt and water, and will also affect the percentage of ionization of the weak acid.\n\nLet's consider the reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and a strong base, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH):\n\nCH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O\n\nInitially, the acetic acid is only partially ionized in the solution:\n\nCH3COOH ⇌ CH3COO- + H+\n\nThe addition of NaOH will cause the following reaction to occur:\n\nOH- + H+ → H2O\n\nAs the strong base reacts with the H+ ions, the equilibrium of the weak acid ionization will shift to the right, according to Le Chatelier's principle, to compensate for the decrease in H+ ions. This will result in an increased percentage of ionization of the acetic acid.\n\nTo determine the exact change in the percentage of ionization, you would need to know the amount of strong base added and perform calculations using the initial concentration of the weak acid, the equilibrium constant (Ka) of the weak acid, and the concentration of the strong base. The final percentage of ionization can be calculated by comparing the concentration of ionized acetic acid to the initial concentration of acetic acid in the solution."
