    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy change for the reaction of [Co(H2O)6]2+ and Cl- to form [CoCl(H2O)5]+ and H2O, we can use Hess's Law. Hess's Law states that the enthalpy change of a reaction is the same whether it occurs in one step or several steps.\n\nFirst, we need to manipulate the given reactions to match the desired reaction:\n\n1. Reverse the second reaction:\n[CoCl(H2O)5]+ + Cl- -> [CoCl4]2- + H2O ∆H = 22 kJ/mol (since we reversed the reaction, the sign of ∆H changes)\n\n2. Add the two reactions:\n[Co(H2O)6]2+ + 4Cl- -> [CoCl4]2- + 6H2O ∆H = -199 kJ/mol\n[CoCl(H2O)5]+ + Cl- -> [CoCl4]2- + H2O ∆H = 22 kJ/mol\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n[Co(H2O)6]2+ + Cl- -> [CoCl(H2O)5]+ + H2O (desired reaction)\n\nNow, add the enthalpy changes of the two reactions:\n∆H = -199 kJ/mol + 22 kJ/mol = -177 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change for the reaction of [Co(H2O)6]2+ and Cl- to form [CoCl(H2O)5]+ and H2O is -177 kJ/mol."
