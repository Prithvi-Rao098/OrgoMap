    "message_2": "Thorium-232 undergoes a decay chain known as the thorium series or 4n decay series, which ultimately results in the formation of a stable isotope of lead. The decay chain involves several alpha and beta decays. Here is the decay chain for Thorium-232:\n\n1. Thorium-232 (Th-232) undergoes alpha decay and forms Radium-228 (Ra-228).\n   Th-232 (α) → Ra-228\n\n2. Radium-228 (Ra-228) undergoes beta decay and forms Actinium-228 (Ac-228).\n   Ra-228 (β) → Ac-228\n\n3. Actinium-228 (Ac-228) undergoes beta decay and forms Thorium-228 (Th-228).\n   Ac-228 (β) → Th-228\n\n4. Thorium-228 (Th-228) undergoes alpha decay and forms Radium-224 (Ra-224).\n   Th-228 (α) → Ra-224\n\n5. Radium-224 (Ra-224) undergoes alpha decay and forms Radon-220 (Rn-220).\n   Ra-224 (α) → Rn-220\n\n6. Radon-220 (Rn-220) undergoes alpha decay and forms Polonium-216 (Po-216).\n   Rn-220 (α) → Po-216\n\n7. Polonium-216 (Po-216) undergoes alpha decay and forms Lead-212 (Pb-212).\n   Po-216 (α) → Pb-212\n\n8. Lead-212 (Pb-212) undergoes beta decay and forms Bismuth-212 (Bi-212).\n   Pb-212 (β) → Bi-212\n\n9. Bismuth-212 (Bi-212) undergoes alpha decay and forms Thallium-208 (Tl-208) with a probability of 35.94%.\n   Bi-212 (α) → Tl-208 (35.94%)\n\n10. Bismuth-212 (Bi-212) undergoes beta decay and forms Polonium-212 (Po-212) with a probability of 64.06%.\n    Bi-212 (β) → Po-212 (64.06%)\n\n11. Polonium-212 (Po-212) undergoes alpha decay and forms Lead-208 (Pb-208).\n    Po-212 (α) → Pb-208\n\n12. Thallium-208 (Tl-208) undergoes beta decay and forms Lead-208 (Pb-208).\n    Tl-208 (β) → Pb-208\n\nThe final stable isotope in the Thorium-232 decay chain is Lead-208 (Pb-208)."
