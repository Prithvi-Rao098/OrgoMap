    "message_1": "What is the energy of a gamma-ray emitted during the decay of an isotope with a half-life of 2.5 days, if the observed count rate of the gamma-ray is 500 counts per minute and the efficiency of the gamma spectrometer used is 40%? Assume that the sample initially contained 1.0 milligram of the isotope, and that the spectrometer has a full energy peak at 1200 keV.",
    "message_2": "To find the energy of the gamma-ray emitted during the decay of the isotope, we can use the information provided about the gamma spectrometer's efficiency and the observed count rate. \n\nFirst, let's find the true count rate of the gamma-ray, which is the count rate without considering the efficiency of the gamma spectrometer. Since the efficiency of the gamma spectrometer is 40%, we can calculate the true count rate as follows:\n\nTrue count rate = Observed count rate / Efficiency\nTrue count rate = 500 counts per minute / 0.40\nTrue count rate = 1250 counts per minute\n\nNow, we know that the spectrometer has a full energy peak at 1200 keV. This means that the energy of the gamma-ray emitted during the decay of the isotope is 1200 keV."
