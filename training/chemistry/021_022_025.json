    "message_2": "To find the expected pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid, we can use the formula for the ionization of a weak acid:\n\nCH3COOH ⇌ CH3COO- + H+\n\nKa = [CH3COO-][H+]/[CH3COOH]\n\nSince the initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.1 M, we can set up an equation to solve for the equilibrium concentrations of the ions:\n\n1.8x10^-5 = (x)(x)/(0.1-x)\n\nAssuming that x is much smaller than 0.1, we can simplify the equation to:\n\n1.8x10^-5 = x^2/0.1\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx^2 = 1.8x10^-6\nx = √(1.8x10^-6)\nx ≈ 1.34x10^-3\n\nSince x represents the concentration of H+ ions, we can now find the pH using the formula:\n\npH = -log[H+]\n\npH = -log(1.34x10^-3)\npH ≈ 2.87\n\nThe expected pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid with a dissociation constant (Ka) of 1.8x10^-5 is approximately 2.87."
