    "message_2": "The oxidation state of the iron atom in FeSO4 can be determined by analyzing the oxidation states of the other elements in the compound and using the rule that the sum of oxidation states in a neutral compound is zero.\n\nIn FeSO4, the sulfate ion (SO4) has a charge of -2. The oxidation state of oxygen is typically -2, and there are four oxygen atoms in the sulfate ion, giving a total oxidation state of -8 for all the oxygen atoms. The oxidation state of sulfur in sulfate is +6, as it balances the -8 from the oxygen atoms.\n\nNow, we can determine the oxidation state of the iron atom (Fe). Since the compound is neutral, the sum of the oxidation states should be zero.\n\nFe + (+6) + (-8) = 0\n\nFe = +2\n\nSo, the oxidation state of the iron atom in FeSO4 is +2."
