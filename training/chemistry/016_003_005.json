    "message_2": "The given reaction represents the breaking of one C-H bond in methane (CH4) to form a methyl radical (CH3) and a hydrogen atom (H). The enthalpy change (∆H) for this reaction is given as 432 kJ/mol. \n\nSince the reaction represents the breaking of one C-H bond, the bond dissociation energy for the C-H bond in methane is equal to the enthalpy change for the reaction.\n\nTherefore, the bond dissociation energy for the C-H bond in methane is 432 kJ/mol."
