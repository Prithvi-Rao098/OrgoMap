    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy of formation of sodium chloride (NaCl), we need to consider the following reaction:\n\nNa(s) + 1/2 Cl2(g) → NaCl(s)\n\nWe are given the standard enthalpy of formation of solid sodium (Na(s)) and gaseous chlorine (Cl2(g)), as well as the standard enthalpy of vaporization of liquid sodium (Na(l)). However, we need to find the enthalpy change for the reaction above.\n\nFirst, we need to convert solid sodium (Na(s)) to gaseous sodium (Na(g)) using the enthalpy of vaporization:\n\nNa(s) → Na(g)    ΔH = 97.5 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we have the following reaction:\n\nNa(g) + 1/2 Cl2(g) → NaCl(s)\n\nThe enthalpy change for this reaction can be calculated using Hess's Law, which states that the enthalpy change for a reaction is the sum of the enthalpy changes for each step in the reaction.\n\nΔH(reaction) = ΔH(formation of Na(g)) + ΔH(formation of NaCl(s))\n\nWe know the enthalpy of formation of Na(s) and the enthalpy of vaporization of Na(l):\n\nΔH(formation of Na(g)) = ΔH(formation of Na(s)) + ΔH(vaporization of Na(l))\nΔH(formation of Na(g)) = -108.5 kJ/mol + 97.5 kJ/mol\nΔH(formation of Na(g)) = -11 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can use Hess's Law to find the enthalpy of formation of NaCl(s):\n\nΔH(formation of NaCl(s)) = ΔH(reaction) - ΔH(formation of Na(g))\n\nSince the enthalpy of formation of Cl2(g) is 0 kJ/mol, the enthalpy change for the reaction is equal to the enthalpy of formation of NaCl(s):\n\nΔH(formation of NaCl(s)) = ΔH(reaction) - (-11 kJ/mol)\nΔH(formation of NaCl(s)) = ΔH(reaction) + 11 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we need to find the enthalpy change for the reaction (ΔH(reaction)). The standard enthalpy of formation of NaCl(s) is a known value, which is -411 kJ/mol. Therefore, we can solve for ΔH(reaction):\n\nΔH(reaction) = ΔH(formation of NaCl(s)) - 11 kJ/mol\nΔH(reaction) = -411 kJ/mol - 11 kJ/mol\nΔH(reaction) = -422 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy of formation of sodium chloride (NaCl) is -411 kJ/mol."
