    "message_2": "Caffeine has the molecular formula C8H10N4O2. To determine the percent composition of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen, we need to find the molar mass of each element in the compound and then divide it by the molar mass of the entire compound.\n\nFirst, let's find the molar mass of each element in caffeine:\n\nCarbon (C): 8 atoms × 12.01 g/mol = 96.08 g/mol\nHydrogen (H): 10 atoms × 1.01 g/mol = 10.10 g/mol\nNitrogen (N): 4 atoms × 14.01 g/mol = 56.04 g/mol\nOxygen (O): 2 atoms × 16.00 g/mol = 32.00 g/mol\n\nNow, let's find the molar mass of the entire compound:\n\nMolar mass of caffeine = 96.08 g/mol (C) + 10.10 g/mol (H) + 56.04 g/mol (N) + 32.00 g/mol (O) = 194.22 g/mol\n\nNext, we'll find the percent composition of each element:\n\nPercent composition of Carbon (C) = (96.08 g/mol ÷ 194.22 g/mol) × 100 = 49.48%\nPercent composition of Hydrogen (H) = (10.10 g/mol ÷ 194.22 g/mol) × 100 = 5.20%\nPercent composition of Nitrogen (N) = (56.04 g/mol ÷ 194.22 g/mol) × 100 = 28.85%\n\nSo, the percent composition of caffeine is approximately 49.48% carbon, 5.20% hydrogen, and 28.85% nitrogen."
