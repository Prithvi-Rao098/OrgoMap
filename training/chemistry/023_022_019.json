    "message_1": "What is the yield of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid obtained from the reaction between 5 grams of benzoic acid and excess nitric acid, if the experiment produced 7.2 grams of crude product with a purity of 75% after recrystallization? Calculate the percentage yield, percentage purity, and the amount of benzoic acid left unreacted.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the theoretical yield of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid. To do this, we need to find the moles of benzoic acid and use stoichiometry to determine the moles of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid that can be produced. Then, we can convert the moles of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid back to grams.\n\nThe molecular weight of benzoic acid (C7H6O2) is 122.12 g/mol, and the molecular weight of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid (C7H4N2O6) is 212.12 g/mol.\n\n1. Calculate the moles of benzoic acid:\nmoles of benzoic acid = mass / molecular weight\nmoles of benzoic acid = 5 g / 122.12 g/mol = 0.0409 mol\n\n2. Use stoichiometry to find the moles of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid:\nThe reaction between benzoic acid and nitric acid is a 1:1 reaction, so the moles of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid produced will be equal to the moles of benzoic acid.\nmoles of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid = 0.0409 mol\n\n3. Calculate the theoretical yield of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid:\nmass of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid = moles * molecular weight\nmass of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid = 0.0409 mol * 212.12 g/mol = 8.67 g (theoretical yield)\n\n4. Calculate the actual yield of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid:\nactual yield = crude product * purity\nactual yield = 7.2 g * 0.75 = 5.4 g\n\n5. Calculate the percentage yield:\npercentage yield = (actual yield / theoretical yield) * 100\npercentage yield = (5.4 g / 8.67 g) * 100 = 62.28%\n\n6. Calculate the amount of benzoic acid left unreacted:\nmass of benzoic acid reacted = actual yield of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid * (molecular weight of benzoic acid / molecular weight of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid)\nmass of benzoic acid reacted = 5.4 g * (122.12 g/mol / 212.12 g/mol) = 3.11 g\n\nmass of benzoic acid unreacted = initial mass of benzoic acid - mass of benzoic acid reacted\nmass of benzoic acid unreacted = 5 g - 3.11 g = 1.89 g\n\nIn summary:\n- The percentage yield of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid is 62.28%.\n- The percentage purity of the crude product is 75%.\n- The amount of benzoic acid left unreacted is 1.89 g."
