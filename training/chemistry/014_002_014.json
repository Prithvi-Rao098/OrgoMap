    "message_2": "The rate of substitution in a coordination complex is influenced by various factors, including the size and charge of the incoming ligand. The effect of these factors can be explained as follows:\n\n1. Size of the incoming ligand: The size of the incoming ligand plays a crucial role in the rate of substitution. Generally, larger ligands have a slower rate of substitution compared to smaller ligands. This is because larger ligands have more steric hindrance, making it more difficult for them to approach and replace the existing ligand in the coordination complex. As a result, the activation energy for the substitution process increases, leading to a slower rate of substitution.\n\n2. Charge of the incoming ligand: The charge of the incoming ligand also affects the rate of substitution in a coordination complex. Ligands with higher charges typically have a faster rate of substitution compared to those with lower charges. This is because higher charged ligands have a stronger electrostatic attraction to the central metal ion, which facilitates the substitution process. Additionally, higher charged ligands can also lead to a more stable complex due to the stronger bonding interactions, which can further increase the rate of substitution.\n\nIn summary, the rate of substitution in a coordination complex is generally faster for smaller and more highly charged incoming ligands. However, it is essential to consider other factors, such as the nature of the metal ion, the existing ligands, and the reaction conditions, as these can also significantly influence the rate of substitution."
