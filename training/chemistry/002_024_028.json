    "message_2": "Copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate ([Cu(H2O)4]SO4•H2O) is a coordination compound with copper(II) ion (Cu2+) surrounded by water molecules. The electronic configuration of Cu2+ is [Ar]3d9, where one electron is removed from the 4s orbital and the other from the 3d orbital.\n\nThe color of a coordination compound is mainly determined by the d-d transitions of the central metal ion. In the case of copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate, the Cu2+ ion has an incomplete d-orbital, which allows for electronic transitions within the d-orbitals when it absorbs light. These electronic transitions are responsible for the color of the compound.\n\nCopper(II) sulfate pentahydrate is known for its characteristic blue color. This color arises from the d-d transitions of the Cu2+ ion, which absorbs light in the red region of the visible spectrum, and the transmitted and reflected light appears blue to our eyes."
