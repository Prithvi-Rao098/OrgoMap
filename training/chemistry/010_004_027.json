    "message_2": "To find the cell potential (Ecell) for the given electrochemical reaction, we first need to determine the reduction potential for the reaction Fe3+(aq) + 3e- → Fe(s). We can do this by combining the two given half-reactions:\n\n1. Fe3+(aq) + e- → Fe2+(aq)  E1 = +0.771 V\n2. Fe2+(aq) + 2e- → Fe(s)    E2 = -0.44 V\n\nFirst, we need to multiply the first half-reaction by 2 to have the same number of electrons as the second half-reaction:\n\n2(Fe3+(aq) + e- → Fe2+(aq))  2E1 = 2(+0.771 V)\n\nWhich gives:\n\n2Fe3+(aq) + 2e- → 2Fe2+(aq)  2E1 = +1.542 V\n\nNow, we can add the two half-reactions together:\n\n2Fe3+(aq) + 2e- → 2Fe2+(aq)  2E1 = +1.542 V\nFe2+(aq) + 2e- → Fe(s)       E2 = -0.44 V\n---------------------------------------------\nFe3+(aq) + 3e- → Fe(s)       Ecell = E1 + E2\n\nFinally, we can calculate the cell potential (Ecell) by adding the reduction potentials of the two half-reactions:\n\nEcell = 2E1 + E2\nEcell = (+1.542 V) + (-0.44 V)\nEcell = +1.102 V\n\nSo, the cell potential (Ecell) for the electrochemical reaction Fe3+(aq) + 3e- → Fe(s) is +1.102 V."
