    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy of formation of methane (ΔHf°), we can use the following combustion reaction:\n\nCH₄(g) + 2O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l)\n\nThe standard enthalpy of combustion of methane (ΔHc°) is given as -890.3 kJ/mol. We also need the standard enthalpies of formation for CO₂(g) and H₂O(l). These values are:\n\nΔHf°(CO₂) = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(H₂O) = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can use Hess's Law to find the standard enthalpy of formation of methane. According to Hess's Law, the enthalpy change of a reaction is the sum of the enthalpy changes of formation of the products minus the sum of the enthalpy changes of formation of the reactants:\n\nΔHc° = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants)\n\n-890.3 kJ/mol = [1 × (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 × (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [ΔHf°(CH₄) + 2 × 0]\n\nNote that the standard enthalpy of formation of an element in its standard state, such as O₂(g), is zero.\n\nNow, we can solve for ΔHf°(CH₄):\n\n-890.3 kJ/mol = (-393.5 kJ/mol - 2 × 285.8 kJ/mol) - ΔHf°(CH₄)\n\nΔHf°(CH₄) = -393.5 kJ/mol - 2 × 285.8 kJ/mol + 890.3 kJ/mol\n\nΔHf°(CH₄) = -74.8 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy of formation of methane (CH₄) at 298 K is -74.8 kJ/mol."
