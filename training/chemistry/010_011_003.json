    "message_2": "To calculate the efficiency of the electrochemical cell, we need to determine the theoretical and actual amounts of charge transferred during the operation.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the theoretical charge transferred (Q_theoretical) during the 10 minutes of operation:\n\nQ_theoretical = Current × Time\nQ_theoretical = 2 A × (10 min × 60 s/min) = 1200 C\n\nNow, let's calculate the actual charge transferred (Q_actual) based on the mass decrease of the electrode:\n\n1. Determine the moles of the electrode material that were oxidized/reduced:\nmoles = (mass decrease) / (molar mass)\nmoles = 0.25 g / 50 g/mol = 0.005 mol\n\n2. Calculate the actual charge transferred using the Faraday constant:\nQ_actual = moles × Faraday constant\nQ_actual = 0.005 mol × 96,485 C/mol = 482.425 C\n\nNow we can calculate the efficiency of the electrochemical cell:\n\nEfficiency = (Q_actual / Q_theoretical) × 100%\nEfficiency = (482.425 C / 1200 C) × 100% = 40.2%\n\nThe efficiency of the electrochemical cell is 40.2%."
