    "message_2": "The predicted bond angle in a water molecule (H2O) using the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory can be determined by examining the electron pairs around the central oxygen atom. In a water molecule, there are two bonding pairs (the two O-H bonds) and two lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen atom. According to VSEPR theory, these electron pairs will arrange themselves to minimize repulsion, resulting in a tetrahedral electron pair geometry.\n\nHowever, since we are only interested in the bond angle between the two hydrogen atoms, we need to consider the O-H-O bond angle. In a perfect tetrahedral geometry, the bond angle would be 109.5 degrees. However, lone pairs of electrons repel more strongly than bonding pairs, causing the O-H-O bond angle to be slightly smaller than the ideal tetrahedral angle.\n\nThe actual bond angle in a water molecule is approximately 104.5 degrees, which is smaller than the ideal tetrahedral angle of 109.5 degrees due to the stronger repulsion from the lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen atom."
