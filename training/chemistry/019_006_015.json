    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction, we need to first determine the equilibrium concentrations of all the species involved in the reaction. Let's assume that x moles of N2 and 3x moles of H2 react to form 2x moles of NH3 at equilibrium.\n\nAt equilibrium, the concentrations will be:\n[N2] = 0.25 - x\n[H2] = 0.10 - 3x\n[NH3] = 0.35 + 2x\n\nNow, we can write the expression for the equilibrium constant (Kc):\n\nKc = [NH3]^2 / ([N2] * [H2]^3)\n\nSubstitute the equilibrium concentrations into the Kc expression:\n\nKc = ((0.35 + 2x)^2) / ((0.25 - x) * (0.10 - 3x)^3)\n\nTo solve for Kc, we need more information, such as the equilibrium concentrations or the value of x. If you have this information, you can plug it into the equation above to find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction at 25°C."
