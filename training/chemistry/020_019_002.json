    "message_2": "The formation of a complex ion between iron (III) and thiocyanate (SCN-) can be represented by the following chemical equation:\n\nFe3+ + 6 SCN- ↔ Fe(SCN)6^3-\n\nIn this reaction, the iron (III) ion (Fe3+) reacts with six thiocyanate ions (SCN-) to form a complex ion, hexathiocyanatoferrate(III) (Fe(SCN)6^3-). The formation of this complex ion is influenced by the pH of the solution.\n\nAs the pH of the solution is increased (becoming more basic), the concentration of H+ ions decreases. Thiocyanate ions can react with H+ ions to form thiocyanic acid (HSCN):\n\nSCN- + H+ ↔ HSCN\n\nWhen the pH is increased, the equilibrium of this reaction shifts to the left, favoring the formation of more SCN- ions. As a result, the concentration of SCN- ions increases, which in turn increases the formation of the complex ion Fe(SCN)6^3- according to Le Chatelier's principle. Consequently, the concentration of the complex ion increases as the pH of the solution is increased.\n\nOn the other hand, when the pH of the solution is decreased (becoming more acidic), the concentration of H+ ions increases. This causes the equilibrium of the SCN- + H+ ↔ HSCN reaction to shift to the right, favoring the formation of more HSCN. As a result, the concentration of SCN- ions decreases, which in turn decreases the formation of the complex ion Fe(SCN)6^3- according to Le Chatelier's principle. Consequently, the concentration of the complex ion decreases as the pH of the solution is decreased.\n\nIn summary, the concentration of the complex ion between iron (III) and thiocyanate is affected by the pH of the solution. As the pH increases, the concentration of the complex ion increases, while as the pH decreases, the concentration of the complex ion decreases. This is due to the changes in the concentration of SCN- ions as a result of the reaction between SCN- and H+ ions, which is influenced by the pH of the solution."
