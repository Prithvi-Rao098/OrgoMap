    "message_2": "To find the percentage composition of iron (Fe) in the compound, we can use the following formula:\n\nPercentage composition = (mass of element / total mass of compound) × 100\n\nIn this case, the mass of iron is 6.75 grams, and the total mass of the compound is 25.00 grams. Plugging these values into the formula:\n\nPercentage composition of Fe = (6.75 g / 25.00 g) × 100\n\nPercentage composition of Fe = 0.27 × 100\n\nPercentage composition of Fe = 27%\n\nTherefore, the percentage composition of iron (Fe) in the compound is 27%."
