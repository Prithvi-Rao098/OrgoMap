    "message_1": "What is the enthalpy of desorption for a sample of water molecules from the surface of sodium chloride, given that the temperature of the system is 298 K and the vapor pressure of water is 23.8 mm Hg? The surface area of the sample is 12.5 cmÂ² and the mass of the water molecules desorbed is 0.25 g. The enthalpy of vaporization for water is 40.7 kJ/mol and the lattice energy of sodium chloride is 786.5 kJ/mol. Assume that the desorption process is reversible and that the gas phase behaves ideally.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of desorption, we first need to find the number of moles of water molecules desorbed. \n\n1. Calculate the number of moles of water desorbed:\nThe molar mass of water is 18.015 g/mol. \n\nmoles of water = mass of water / molar mass of water\nmoles of water = 0.25 g / 18.015 g/mol = 0.0139 mol\n\n2. Calculate the enthalpy of vaporization for the desorbed water molecules:\n\nEnthalpy of vaporization per mole = 40.7 kJ/mol\n\nTotal enthalpy of vaporization = moles of water * enthalpy of vaporization per mole\nTotal enthalpy of vaporization = 0.0139 mol * 40.7 kJ/mol = 0.5657 kJ\n\n3. Calculate the enthalpy of desorption:\n\nSince the desorption process is reversible and the gas phase behaves ideally, the enthalpy of desorption is equal to the enthalpy of vaporization for the desorbed water molecules.\n\nEnthalpy of desorption = Total enthalpy of vaporization = 0.5657 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy of desorption for the sample of water molecules from the surface of sodium chloride is 0.5657 kJ."
