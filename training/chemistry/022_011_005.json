    "message_2": "The chemical equation for the gas evolution reaction between hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) is as follows:\n\n2 HCl (aq) + Na2CO3 (s) → 2 NaCl (aq) + H2O (l) + CO2 (g)\n\nTo calculate the volume of carbon dioxide gas produced at STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure: 0°C and 1 atm), we first need to determine the limiting reactant.\n\n1. Calculate the moles of HCl:\nMolarity (M) = moles of solute / volume of solution (L)\n1.5 M = moles of HCl / 0.025 L\nmoles of HCl = 1.5 M × 0.025 L = 0.0375 mol\n\n2. Calculate the moles of Na2CO3:\nMolar mass of Na2CO3 = (2 × 22.99) + 12.01 + (3 × 16.00) = 105.99 g/mol\nmoles of Na2CO3 = mass / molar mass = 2 g / 105.99 g/mol = 0.0189 mol\n\n3. Determine the limiting reactant:\nThe stoichiometry of the reaction is 2 moles of HCl for every 1 mole of Na2CO3. Therefore, we need to compare the mole ratio of HCl to Na2CO3.\n\nHCl : Na2CO3 = 0.0375 mol : 0.0189 mol = 1.98 : 1\n\nSince the mole ratio is approximately 2:1, both reactants are consumed completely, and there is no limiting reactant.\n\n4. Calculate the moles of CO2 produced:\nAccording to the balanced equation, 1 mole of Na2CO3 produces 1 mole of CO2. Therefore, the moles of CO2 produced are equal to the moles of Na2CO3 consumed.\n\nmoles of CO2 = 0.0189 mol\n\n5. Calculate the volume of CO2 produced at STP:\nAt STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L. Therefore, the volume of CO2 produced can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nVolume of CO2 = moles of CO2 × 22.4 L/mol\nVolume of CO2 = 0.0189 mol × 22.4 L/mol = 0.423 L\n\nSo, the volume of carbon dioxide gas produced at STP when 25 mL of 1.5 M hydrochloric acid solution is added to 2 grams of sodium carbonate is approximately 0.423 L."
