    "message_2": "In the compound potassium permanganate (KMnO4), the oxidation states of the elements are as follows:\n\na) Potassium (K): The oxidation state of potassium in this compound is +1. Potassium is an alkali metal and always has an oxidation state of +1 in its compounds.\n\nb) Manganese (Mn): To determine the oxidation state of manganese, we need to consider the overall charge of the compound and the oxidation states of the other elements. The compound KMnO4 is neutral, so the sum of the oxidation states of all the elements must equal zero.\n\nc) Oxygen (O): Oxygen typically has an oxidation state of -2 in its compounds (except in peroxides where it is -1). In KMnO4, there are four oxygen atoms, each with an oxidation state of -2, contributing a total of -8.\n\nNow, we can determine the oxidation state of manganese (Mn) using the information above. The sum of the oxidation states of all the elements in the compound must equal zero:\n\n(+1) + (Mn) + (-8) = 0\n\nSolving for Mn, we get:\n\nMn = +7\n\nSo, the oxidation states of the elements in potassium permanganate (KMnO4) are:\n\na) Potassium (K): +1\nb) Manganese (Mn): +7\nc) Oxygen (O): -2"
