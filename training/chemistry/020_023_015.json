    "message_2": "The redox reaction between iodine (I2) and iodide ions (I-) can be represented by the following equation:\n\nI2 + 2e- ⇌ 2I-\n\nThis reaction involves the transfer of electrons, with iodine gaining electrons (reduction) and iodide ions losing electrons (oxidation). The equilibrium position of this reaction can be affected by changes in pH.\n\nAs the pH increases (becomes more basic), the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH-) in the solution also increases. The presence of hydroxide ions can react with iodine to form iodide ions and hypoiodite ions (OI-), as shown in the following equation:\n\nI2 + 2OH- ⇌ 2I- + O2\n\nThis reaction consumes iodine and produces iodide ions, which shifts the equilibrium of the original redox reaction to the right. As a result, the concentration of iodine decreases, and the concentration of iodide ions increases.\n\nIn summary, increasing the pH of the solution shifts the equilibrium position of the redox reaction between iodine and iodide ions to the right, favoring the formation of iodide ions."
