    "message_2": "To determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound X, we need to analyze the given NMR data.\n\n1. Proton NMR (1H NMR) spectrum:\n- A peak at a chemical shift of 3.78 ppm\n\n2. Carbon NMR (13C NMR) spectrum:\n- A single peak\n\nLet's analyze the proton NMR data first. A chemical shift of 3.78 ppm in a proton NMR spectrum typically corresponds to the presence of a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to an electronegative atom, such as oxygen or nitrogen. This suggests that the compound may contain an ether (R-O-R') or an amine (R-NH-R') functional group.\n\nNow let's analyze the carbon NMR data. The presence of a single peak in the carbon NMR spectrum indicates that there is only one type of carbon environment in the molecule. This suggests that the compound is symmetrical.\n\nConsidering both the proton and carbon NMR data, the most likely structure for the unknown compound X is a symmetrical ether or amine with a methylene group adjacent to the electronegative atom. Two possible chemical formulas for compound X are:\n\n1. H3C-CH2-O-CH2-CH3 (diethyl ether)\n2. H3C-CH2-NH-CH2-CH3 (N-ethylmethanamine)\n\nHowever, the chemical shift of 3.78 ppm is more consistent with an ether functional group than an amine. Therefore, the most probable chemical formula for the unknown compound X is:\n\nH3C-CH2-O-CH2-CH3 (diethyl ether)"
