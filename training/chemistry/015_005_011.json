    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) of methane (CH4) from its constituent elements at 298 K, we need to consider the following reaction:\n\nC (graphite) + 2 H2 (g) → CH4 (g)\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) of methane can be calculated using the bond dissociation enthalpies of the C-H and H-H bonds. \n\nIn the formation of methane, we break 2 moles of H-H bonds and form 4 moles of C-H bonds. The enthalpy change for breaking the H-H bonds is positive (endothermic), while the enthalpy change for forming the C-H bonds is negative (exothermic).\n\nΔHf° (CH4) = [4 * (ΔH (C-H bond formation)) - 2 * (ΔH (H-H bond dissociation))]\n\nGiven the bond dissociation enthalpies:\nΔH (C-H bond) = -413 kJ/mol (exothermic, so negative)\nΔH (H-H bond) = 436 kJ/mol (endothermic, so positive)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nΔHf° (CH4) = [4 * (-413 kJ/mol) - 2 * (436 kJ/mol)]\nΔHf° (CH4) = (-1652 kJ/mol) - (872 kJ/mol)\nΔHf° (CH4) = -2524 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) of methane (CH4) from its constituent elements at 298 K is -2524 kJ/mol."
