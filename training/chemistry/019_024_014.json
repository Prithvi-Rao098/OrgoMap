    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH° = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants)\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nHCl (aq) + KOH (aq) → KCl (aq) + H2O (l)\n\nNow, we can plug in the standard enthalpy of formation values for each compound:\n\nΔH° = [(-436.6 kJ/mol) + (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [(-92.3 kJ/mol) + (-424.4 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH° = (-722.4 kJ/mol) - (-516.7 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH° = -205.7 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the reaction between hydrochloric acid and potassium hydroxide to form potassium chloride and water at 25°C and 1 atm pressure is -205.7 kJ/mol."
