    "message_2": "Several polymer-based membrane materials have shown promising performance in removing heavy metals from wastewater in the context of water treatment. Some of the most effective materials include:\n\n1. Chitosan-based membranes: Chitosan, a natural biopolymer derived from chitin, has been widely studied for its excellent heavy metal adsorption properties. Chitosan-based membranes have been reported to effectively remove heavy metals such as lead, copper, and cadmium from wastewater.\n\n2. Polysulfone (PSF) and polyethersulfone (PES) membranes: These synthetic polymers have been used to fabricate ultrafiltration and nanofiltration membranes, which have shown good performance in removing heavy metals from wastewater. The performance can be further enhanced by modifying the membrane surface with functional groups or nanoparticles.\n\n3. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes: PVDF is a highly stable and chemically resistant polymer, making it suitable for wastewater treatment applications. PVDF membranes have been reported to effectively remove heavy metals such as chromium, nickel, and zinc from wastewater.\n\n4. Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) membranes: PAN is another synthetic polymer that has been used to fabricate ultrafiltration and nanofiltration membranes for heavy metal removal from wastewater. PAN membranes can be modified with various functional groups or nanoparticles to enhance their heavy metal adsorption capacity.\n\n5. Cellulose acetate (CA) membranes: CA is a biodegradable and renewable polymer derived from cellulose. CA-based membranes have been reported to effectively remove heavy metals such as lead, copper, and cadmium from wastewater.\n\nThe performance of these polymer-based membranes can be influenced by factors such as membrane pore size, surface charge, and hydrophilicity. Therefore, the choice of the best membrane material depends on the specific heavy metals to be removed, the wastewater matrix, and the desired treatment efficiency."
