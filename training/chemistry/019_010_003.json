The balanced chemical equation for the combustion of propane is:\n\nC3H8(g) + 5O2(g) → 3CO2(g) + 4H2O(g) \n\nGiven the standard enthalpy of formation at 25°C and 1 atm for C3H8(g), CO2(g), H2O(g) are -103.8 kJ/mol, -393.5 kJ/mol and -241.8 kJ/mol respectively.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of propane, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH_combustion = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH_combustion is the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of propane, ΔH_f(products) are the standard enthalpies of formation for the products, and ΔH_f(reactants) are the standard enthalpies of formation for the reactants.\n\nFrom the balanced chemical equation, we have:\n\nReactants: 1 mol of C3H8(g) and 5 mol of O2(g)\nProducts: 3 mol of CO2(g) and 4 mol of H2O(g)\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation for O2(g) is 0 kJ/mol since it is in its elemental form.\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the equation:\n\nΔH_combustion = [(3 mol × -393.5 kJ/mol) + (4 mol × -241.8 kJ/mol)] - [(1 mol × -103.8 kJ/mol) + (5 mol × 0 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH_combustion = [-1180.5 kJ + (-967.2 kJ)] - [-103.8 kJ]\n\nΔH_combustion = -2147.7 kJ + 103.8 kJ\n\nΔH_combustion = -2043.9 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the combustion of propane is -2043.9 kJ/mol. Since we are given 5 moles of propane, the total enthalpy change for the combustion of 5 moles of propane is:\n\nTotal enthalpy change = (-2043.9 kJ/mol) × 5 mol = -10219.5 kJ"
