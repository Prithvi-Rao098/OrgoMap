    "message_2": "The standard enthalpy of formation of methane gas (CHâ‚„) at 298 K is -74.8 kJ/mol. This value represents the change in enthalpy when one mole of methane is formed from its constituent elements (carbon and hydrogen) in their standard states under standard conditions (298 K and 1 atm pressure)."
