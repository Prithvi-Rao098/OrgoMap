    "message_1": "What is the heat of mixing when 100 mL of water at 25°C is added to 100 mL of ethanol at 25°C, assuming ideal behavior? The density of water is 1 g/mL and the density of ethanol is 0.789 g/mL. The heat capacity of the mixture is 4.18 J/g°C.",
    "message_2": "When two liquids are mixed, and they exhibit ideal behavior, the heat of mixing is zero. This is because there are no significant changes in the intermolecular forces between the molecules of the two liquids when they are mixed. In other words, the energy required to break the intermolecular forces in the individual liquids is equal to the energy released when new intermolecular forces are formed in the mixture.\n\nIn this case, since we are assuming ideal behavior for the mixing of water and ethanol, the heat of mixing will be 0 J."
