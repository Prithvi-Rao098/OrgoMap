    "message_2": "Chemistry instructors can provide opportunities for undergraduate students to access and participate in current research in chemistry through various methods, despite the limited exposure to it in the classroom. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. Collaborate with research faculty: Instructors can collaborate with research faculty members in their department to identify ongoing research projects that could accommodate undergraduate students. This could involve creating a list of available research opportunities and sharing it with students.\n\n2. Develop research-based courses: Instructors can design courses that incorporate current research topics and techniques. This can help students gain hands-on experience in research methods and become familiar with the latest developments in the field.\n\n3. Encourage participation in research conferences: Instructors can encourage students to attend and present their research at local, regional, or national conferences. This can help students network with other researchers and learn about the latest advancements in chemistry.\n\n4. Establish research internships: Instructors can work with local industries, research institutions, or government agencies to create research internships for undergraduate students. These internships can provide students with valuable research experience and exposure to real-world applications of chemistry.\n\n5. Promote undergraduate research journals: Instructors can encourage students to submit their research findings to undergraduate research journals. This can help students gain experience in writing scientific papers and improve their communication skills.\n\n6. Create research clubs or societies: Instructors can help students form research clubs or societies that focus on specific areas of chemistry. These clubs can organize seminars, workshops, and other events to promote research and collaboration among students.\n\n7. Utilize online resources: Instructors can direct students to online resources, such as research databases, journals, and websites, to help them stay updated on current research in chemistry.\n\n8. Mentorship programs: Instructors can establish mentorship programs that pair undergraduate students with graduate students or faculty members who are actively involved in research. This can provide students with guidance and support as they navigate the research process.\n\n9. Incorporate research into capstone projects: Instructors can require students to complete a research-based capstone project as part of their degree program. This can help students gain experience in conducting independent research and applying their knowledge to real-world problems.\n\n10. Foster a research-oriented culture: Instructors can promote a research-oriented culture within their department by regularly discussing current research topics in class, inviting guest speakers to share their research experiences, and celebrating the research achievements of students and faculty members."
