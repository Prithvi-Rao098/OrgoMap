    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the fusion reaction of a sodium atom, we need to consider the enthalpy of formation of Na(g) and the enthalpy of fusion of Na(s).\n\nThe fusion reaction can be represented as:\n\nNa(s) → Na(g)\n\nThe enthalpy change for this reaction is the difference between the enthalpy of formation of Na(g) and the enthalpy of fusion of Na(s).\n\nΔH_fusion = ΔH_formation(Na(g)) - ΔH_fusion(Na(s))\n\nGiven the enthalpy of formation of Na(g) is 107.3 kJ/mol and the enthalpy of fusion of Na(s) is 2.6 kJ/mol, we can plug in the values:\n\nΔH_fusion = 107.3 kJ/mol - 2.6 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_fusion = 104.7 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the fusion reaction of a sodium atom is 104.7 kJ/mol."
