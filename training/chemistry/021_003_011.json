    "message_2": "The molecule SF6 (sulfur hexafluoride) has an octahedral geometry, which means it has six bonding pairs of electrons surrounding the central sulfur atom. In an octahedral arrangement, the bond angle between the ligands (in this case, the fluorine atoms) is 90 degrees.\n\nThe molecule's shape (octahedral) directly relates to its bond angle because the arrangement of the six fluorine atoms around the central sulfur atom allows for the maximum separation between the electron pairs, minimizing electron repulsion and resulting in a stable structure. This arrangement leads to the 90-degree bond angles observed in SF6."
