    "message_1": "What is the empirical formula of a compound that contains 2.40 grams of sodium, 3.52 grams of chlorine, and 4.08 grams of oxygen?",
    "message_2": "To find the empirical formula of the compound, we need to first convert the grams of each element to moles, and then find the mole ratio of each element in the compound.\n\n1. Convert grams to moles:\n- Sodium (Na): 2.40 g / (22.99 g/mol) = 0.104 mol\n- Chlorine (Cl): 3.52 g / (35.45 g/mol) = 0.099 mol\n- Oxygen (O): 4.08 g / (16.00 g/mol) = 0.255 mol\n\n2. Find the mole ratio:\nDivide each mole value by the smallest mole value to find the mole ratio.\n- Na: 0.104 mol / 0.099 mol = 1.05 ≈ 1\n- Cl: 0.099 mol / 0.099 mol = 1\n- O: 0.255 mol / 0.099 mol = 2.58 ≈ 3 (round to the nearest whole number)\n\n3. Write the empirical formula:\nThe empirical formula is NaClO₃ (sodium chlorate)."
