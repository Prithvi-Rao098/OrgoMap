    "message_2": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) are both molecules composed of a central atom (carbon or sulfur, respectively) bonded to two oxygen atoms. However, their molecular geometries and polarities are different due to differences in their electron configurations and bonding.\n\n1. Carbon dioxide (CO2):\nMolecular geometry: Linear\nPolarity: Nonpolar\n\nIn CO2, the carbon atom is double-bonded to each oxygen atom. The electron configuration of carbon allows it to form four bonds, and in this case, it forms two double bonds with the oxygen atoms. The molecule has a linear geometry, with the O-C-O bond angle being 180 degrees. Due to the symmetry of the molecule and the equal electronegativity of the oxygen atoms, the bond dipoles cancel each other out, resulting in a nonpolar molecule.\n\n2. Sulfur dioxide (SO2):\nMolecular geometry: Bent or V-shaped\nPolarity: Polar\n\nIn SO2, the sulfur atom is double-bonded to one oxygen atom and single-bonded to the other oxygen atom, with a lone pair of electrons on the sulfur atom. The electron configuration of sulfur allows it to form six bonds, but in this case, it forms three (two with one oxygen and one with the other oxygen). The molecule has a bent or V-shaped geometry due to the presence of the lone pair on the sulfur atom, with the O-S-O bond angle being approximately 119 degrees. The unequal distribution of electron density and the bent geometry result in a net dipole moment, making SO2 a polar molecule.\n\nIn summary, CO2 and SO2 differ in their molecular geometries and polarities. CO2 has a linear geometry and is nonpolar, while SO2 has a bent geometry and is polar."
