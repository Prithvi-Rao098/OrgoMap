    "message_2": "To prepare 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid from benzoic acid and nitric acid, we will use a two-step process. First, we will nitrate benzoic acid to form 4-nitrobenzoic acid, and then we will nitrate 4-nitrobenzoic acid to form 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid. \n\nStep 1: Preparation of 4-nitrobenzoic acid from benzoic acid\n1.1. Reaction: Benzoic acid + Nitric acid → 4-nitrobenzoic acid + Water\nC6H5COOH + HNO3 → C6H4(NO2)COOH + H2O\n\n1.2. Calculate the required amounts of reagents:\nAssuming we want to prepare 1 mole of 4-nitrobenzoic acid:\n- 1 mole of benzoic acid (C6H5COOH) is required. Its molar mass is 122.12 g/mol, so we need 122.12 g of benzoic acid.\n- 1 mole of nitric acid (HNO3) is required. Its molar mass is 63.01 g/mol, so we need 63.01 g of nitric acid.\n\nStep 2: Preparation of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid from 4-nitrobenzoic acid\n2.1. Reaction: 4-nitrobenzoic acid + Nitric acid → 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid + Water\nC6H4(NO2)COOH + HNO3 → C6H3(NO2)2COOH + H2O\n\n2.2. Calculate the required amounts of reagents:\nAssuming we want to prepare 1 mole of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid:\n- 1 mole of 4-nitrobenzoic acid (C6H4(NO2)COOH) is required. Its molar mass is 167.11 g/mol, so we need 167.11 g of 4-nitrobenzoic acid.\n- 1 mole of nitric acid (HNO3) is required. Its molar mass is 63.01 g/mol, so we need 63.01 g of nitric acid.\n\nTheoretical yield calculation:\nThe overall reaction is:\nC6H5COOH + 2 HNO3 → C6H3(NO2)2COOH + 2 H2O\n\nSince we started with 1 mole of benzoic acid and 2 moles of nitric acid, we can theoretically obtain 1 mole of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid. The molar mass of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid (C6H3(NO2)2COOH) is 212.11 g/mol. Therefore, the theoretical yield of the final product is 212.11 g."
