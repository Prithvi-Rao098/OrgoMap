    "message_2": "To calculate the standard free energy change (ΔG°) for the redox reaction, we first need to determine the overall cell potential (E°cell) for the reaction. We can do this by subtracting the standard reduction potential of the half-reaction being oxidized from the standard reduction potential of the half-reaction being reduced.\n\nIn this case, the half-reactions are:\n\nFe^3+(aq) + e^- --> Fe^2+(aq)     E° = +0.771 V (reduction)\n2H^+(aq) + 2e^- --> H2(g)             E° = 0.000 V (oxidation)\n\nSince the H2(g) is being oxidized to 2H^+(aq), we need to reverse the second half-reaction:\n\nH2(g) --> 2H^+(aq) + 2e^-             E° = -0.000 V (oxidation)\n\nNow, we can calculate the overall cell potential (E°cell):\n\nE°cell = E°(reduction) - E°(oxidation)\nE°cell = 0.771 V - (-0.000 V)\nE°cell = 0.771 V\n\nNext, we can use the relationship between the standard free energy change (ΔG°), the overall cell potential (E°cell), and the number of moles of electrons transferred (n) in the reaction:\n\nΔG° = -n * F * E°cell\n\nwhere F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol).\n\nIn this reaction, 2 moles of electrons are transferred (from H2 to 2Fe^3+). So, n = 2.\n\nNow, we can calculate ΔG°:\n\nΔG° = -2 * 96,485 C/mol * 0.771 V\nΔG° = -148,995.77 J/mol\n\nSince the standard free energy change is typically expressed in kJ/mol, we can convert this value:\n\nΔG° = -148.995 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard free energy change for the redox reaction is -148.995 kJ/mol."
