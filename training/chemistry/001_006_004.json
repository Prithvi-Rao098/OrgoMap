    "message_2": "The hydration reaction of 1-methylcyclohex-1-ene with aqueous sulfuric acid involves the addition of water across the double bond, resulting in the formation of an alcohol. The product of this reaction is 1-methylcyclohexanol. The complete mechanism for this reaction is as follows:\n\n1. Protonation of the alkene: The double bond of 1-methylcyclohex-1-ene acts as a nucleophile and attacks a proton from sulfuric acid (H2SO4), forming a carbocation intermediate. The carbocation is formed at the more substituted carbon (the tertiary carbon) due to the stability provided by hyperconjugation.\n\n2. Nucleophilic attack by water: A water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbocation, forming a new bond with the tertiary carbon.\n\n3. Deprotonation: Another water molecule acts as a base and abstracts a proton from the oxygen atom of the newly formed OH group, resulting in the formation of 1-methylcyclohexanol and a hydronium ion (H3O+).\n\nOverall, the reaction can be summarized as:\n\n1-methylcyclohex-1-ene + H2O (in the presence of H2SO4) â†’ 1-methylcyclohexanol"
