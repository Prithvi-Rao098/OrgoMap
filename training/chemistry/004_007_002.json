    "message_1": "What is the mass of copper in a 1.50 gram brass alloy sample, given that the sample was dissolved in nitric acid and then reacted with excess sodium hydroxide to form copper (II) oxide, which was then converted to copper (II) sulfate pentahydrate and finally precipitated as copper (II) oxalate monohydrate during gravimetric analysis?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the moles of copper (II) oxalate monohydrate formed.\n2. Convert the moles of copper (II) oxalate monohydrate to moles of copper.\n3. Calculate the mass of copper in the sample.\n\nFirst, we need the molar mass of copper (II) oxalate monohydrate (CuC2O4·H2O):\nCu: 63.55 g/mol\nC: 12.01 g/mol\nO: 16.00 g/mol\nH: 1.01 g/mol\n\nMolar mass of CuC2O4·H2O = 63.55 + (2 × 12.01) + (4 × 16.00) + (2 × 1.01) = 63.55 + 24.02 + 64.00 + 2.02 = 153.59 g/mol\n\nNow, we need to find the mass of copper (II) oxalate monohydrate formed during the gravimetric analysis. Since we are not given this information, we will assume that the entire 1.50 g brass alloy sample was converted to copper (II) oxalate monohydrate.\n\n1. Calculate the moles of copper (II) oxalate monohydrate formed:\nmoles = mass / molar mass\nmoles of CuC2O4·H2O = 1.50 g / 153.59 g/mol = 0.00976 mol\n\n2. Convert the moles of copper (II) oxalate monohydrate to moles of copper:\nSince there is a 1:1 ratio between copper (II) oxalate monohydrate and copper, the moles of copper are the same as the moles of copper (II) oxalate monohydrate:\nmoles of Cu = 0.00976 mol\n\n3. Calculate the mass of copper in the sample:\nmass = moles × molar mass\nmass of Cu = 0.00976 mol × 63.55 g/mol = 0.620 g\n\nTherefore, the mass of copper in the 1.50 g brass alloy sample is approximately 0.620 g."
