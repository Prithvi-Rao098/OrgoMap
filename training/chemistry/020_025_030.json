    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given redox reaction, we need to use the Nernst equation. First, we need to determine the half-reactions for the redox reaction:\n\nOxidation half-reaction: 2I⁻(aq) → I2(aq) + 2e⁻\nReduction half-reaction: H2O2(aq) + 2H⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → 2H2O(l)\n\nNow, we need to find the standard reduction potentials (E°) for both half-reactions. The standard reduction potential for the reduction half-reaction involving H2O2 is +1.776 V. The standard reduction potential for the oxidation half-reaction involving I⁻ is +0.536 V.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the standard cell potential (E°cell) for the redox reaction:\n\nE°cell = E°(reduction) - E°(oxidation)\nE°cell = (+1.776 V) - (+0.536 V)\nE°cell = +1.240 V\n\nNow, we can use the Nernst equation to calculate the equilibrium constant (Kc) at 25°C:\n\nE°cell = (RT/nF) * ln(Kc)\n\nWhere:\n- R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\n- T is the temperature in Kelvin (25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K)\n- n is the number of moles of electrons transferred (2 moles in this case)\n- F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol)\n\nRearranging the Nernst equation to solve for Kc:\n\nKc = e^(nFE°cell/RT)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nKc = e^((2 * 96,485 C/mol * 1.240 V) / (8.314 J/mol·K * 298.15 K))\n\nKc = e^(239,322.4 / 2474.7)\n\nKc ≈ 1.1 × 10^41\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given redox reaction at 25°C is approximately 1.1 × 10^41."
