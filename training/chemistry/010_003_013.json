    "message_1": "Calculate the Gibbs free energy change for the electrochemical reaction in which 2 moles of electrons are transferred from a zinc electrode to a copper electrode. The standard reduction potentials are E°(Cu²⁺/Cu) = 0.34 V and E°(Zn²⁺/Zn) = -0.76 V. What is the spontaneity of the reaction under standard conditions?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) for the electrochemical reaction, we first need to determine the standard cell potential (E°cell) for the reaction. The standard cell potential can be calculated using the standard reduction potentials of the two half-reactions:\n\nE°cell = E°(Cu²⁺/Cu) - E°(Zn²⁺/Zn)\n\nE°cell = 0.34 V - (-0.76 V) = 1.10 V\n\nNow that we have the standard cell potential, we can calculate the Gibbs free energy change using the following equation:\n\nΔG° = -nFE°cell\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of electrons transferred (2 moles in this case), F is the Faraday's constant (96,485 C/mol), and E°cell is the standard cell potential.\n\nΔG° = -2 mol × 96,485 C/mol × 1.10 V\n\nΔG° = -212,667 J/mol\n\nSince the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) is negative, the reaction is spontaneous under standard conditions."
