    "message_2": "The oxidation product of 2-methyl-1-propanol using Jones' reagent is 2-methylpropanal.\n\nJones' reagent is a mixture of chromium trioxide (CrO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) in water, which is a strong oxidizing agent. The mechanism of the reaction is as follows:\n\n1. Protonation of the alcohol: The hydroxyl group (-OH) of 2-methyl-1-propanol gets protonated by the sulfuric acid (H2SO4) to form a better leaving group, water (H2O).\n2. Formation of the chromate ester: The chromium trioxide (CrO3) attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the water molecule leaves, forming a chromate ester intermediate.\n3. Hydrolysis of the chromate ester: The chromate ester is hydrolyzed by water, breaking the bond between the chromium and the carbonyl carbon, and forming the carbonyl group (C=O) in the product, 2-methylpropanal.\n\nOverall, the primary alcohol (2-methyl-1-propanol) is oxidized to an aldehyde (2-methylpropanal) using Jones' reagent."
