    "message_1": "What is the efficiency of an electrochemical cell if the standard emf of the cell is 1.2 V and the actual voltage obtained from the cell is 0.8 V? The reduction of copper (Cu) and oxidation of zinc (Zn) are the two half-reactions taking place in the cell. The molecular weight of Cu is 63.5 g/mol and Zn is 65.38 g/mol. The cell operates by passing a current of 0.5 A for 10 minutes. What is the amount of copper deposited on the cathode during this time? (Assume 100% current efficiency)",
    "message_2": "To find the efficiency of the electrochemical cell, we can use the following formula:\n\nEfficiency = (Actual voltage / Standard emf) * 100\n\nEfficiency = (0.8 V / 1.2 V) * 100 = 66.67%\n\nNow, let's find the amount of copper deposited on the cathode during the 10 minutes of operation. Since we assume 100% current efficiency, we can use Faraday's law of electrolysis:\n\nm = (I * t * M) / (n * F)\n\nwhere m is the mass of copper deposited, I is the current (0.5 A), t is the time in seconds (10 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 600 seconds), M is the molar mass of copper (63.5 g/mol), n is the number of electrons transferred in the half-reaction (for Cu, n = 2, as the half-reaction is Cu^2+ + 2e^- -> Cu), and F is the Faraday constant (96485 C/mol).\n\nm = (0.5 A * 600 s * 63.5 g/mol) / (2 * 96485 C/mol)\n\nm â‰ˆ 0.987 g\n\nSo, the amount of copper deposited on the cathode during this time is approximately 0.987 grams."
