    "message_2": "To find the rate constant (k) for the free radical polymerization of vinyl acetate at 60°C, we can use the half-life (t1/2) formula for a first-order reaction:\n\nt1/2 = 0.693 / k\n\nGiven that the half-life of the monomer is 10 minutes, we can plug this value into the formula and solve for k:\n\n10 minutes = 0.693 / k\n\nNow, we can rearrange the equation to solve for k:\n\nk = 0.693 / 10 minutes\n\nk = 0.0693 min^(-1)\n\nSince we need the rate constant in units of L/mol⋅s, we need to convert the time unit from minutes to seconds:\n\n1 minute = 60 seconds\n\nk = 0.0693 min^(-1) * (1 min / 60 s)\n\nk ≈ 0.001155 L/mol⋅s\n\nSo, the rate constant for the free radical polymerization of vinyl acetate at 60°C is approximately 0.001155 L/mol⋅s."
