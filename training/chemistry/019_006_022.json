    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction, we can use the expression:\n\nKc = [NH3]^2 / ([N2] * [H2]^3)\n\nGiven the concentrations at equilibrium:\n[N2] = 0.050 M\n[H2] = 0.020 M\n[NH3] = 0.040 M\n\nPlug these values into the Kc expression:\n\nKc = (0.040)^2 / (0.050 * (0.020)^3)\nKc = 0.0016 / (0.050 * 0.000008)\nKc = 0.0016 / 0.0000004\nKc = 4000\n\nThe equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction at 298 K is 4000."
