    "message_2": "The optimal temperature and pressure conditions needed to maximize the yield of methanol production via the catalytic conversion of carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas in a batch reactor are typically around 250-300°C (482-572°F) and 50-100 atm (5075-10150 psi). These conditions provide a balance between the reaction rate and the equilibrium conversion, leading to a high yield of methanol. However, it is important to note that the specific optimal conditions may vary depending on the catalyst used and the reactor design."
