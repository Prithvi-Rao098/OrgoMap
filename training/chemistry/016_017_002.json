    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of oxidation of methane gas, we need to use Hess's Law, which states that the total enthalpy change for a reaction is the sum of the enthalpy changes for each step in the reaction. In this case, we are given the enthalpy change of combustion of methane, the enthalpy change of formation of carbon dioxide, and the enthalpy change of formation of water vapor.\n\nThe balanced equation for the oxidation of methane is:\n\nCH₄(g) + 2O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nFirst, we need to find the enthalpy change for the formation of methane (ΔHf°[CH₄]). We can do this by rearranging the enthalpy change of combustion of methane equation:\n\nΔHc°[CH₄] = ΔHf°[CO₂] + 2ΔHf°[H₂O] - ΔHf°[CH₄]\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\n-890.3 kJ/mol = (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2(-241.8 kJ/mol) - ΔHf°[CH₄]\n\nSolve for ΔHf°[CH₄]:\n\nΔHf°[CH₄] = (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2(-241.8 kJ/mol) + 890.3 kJ/mol\nΔHf°[CH₄] = -393.5 kJ/mol - 483.6 kJ/mol + 890.3 kJ/mol\nΔHf°[CH₄] = 13.2 kJ/mol\n\nNow that we have the enthalpy change for the formation of methane, we can calculate the enthalpy of oxidation of methane:\n\nΔH°[oxidation] = ΔHf°[CO₂] + 2ΔHf°[H₂O] - ΔHf°[CH₄]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\nΔH°[oxidation] = (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2(-241.8 kJ/mol) - 13.2 kJ/mol\nΔH°[oxidation] = -393.5 kJ/mol - 483.6 kJ/mol - 13.2 kJ/mol\nΔH°[oxidation] = -890.3 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy of oxidation of methane gas is -890.3 kJ/mol."
