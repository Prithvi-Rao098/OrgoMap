    "message_2": "To determine the bond order and bond length of nitrogen gas (N2) using molecular orbital theory, we need to follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Determine the total number of valence electrons in N2.\nNitrogen has 5 valence electrons, and since there are two nitrogen atoms in N2, the total number of valence electrons is 5 * 2 = 10.\n\nStep 2: Fill the molecular orbitals according to the energy levels and the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\nThe order of filling molecular orbitals is σ1s, σ*1s, σ2s, σ*2s, π2p, π*2p, σ2p, σ*2p. We will fill the orbitals with the 10 valence electrons.\n\n1. σ1s: 2 electrons\n2. σ*1s: 2 electrons\n3. σ2s: 2 electrons\n4. σ*2s: 2 electrons\n5. π2p: 2 electrons (both degenerate π2px and π2py orbitals will have 1 electron each)\n\nStep 3: Calculate the bond order.\nBond order = (number of electrons in bonding orbitals - number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\n\nBonding orbitals: σ1s (2 e⁻), σ2s (2 e⁻), π2p (2 e⁻) → 6 electrons\nAntibonding orbitals: σ*1s (2 e⁻), σ*2s (2 e⁻) → 4 electrons\n\nBond order = (6 - 4) / 2 = 1\n\nThe bond order of nitrogen gas (N2) is 1.\n\nStep 4: Determine the bond length.\nThe bond length of N2 cannot be directly calculated using molecular orbital theory. However, we can use experimental data to find the bond length. The bond length of N2 is approximately 1.10 Å (angstroms).\n\nIn summary, the bond order of nitrogen gas (N2) is 1, and its bond length is approximately 1.10 Å."
