    "message_1": "\"What is the efficiency of an electrochemical cell if the emf of the cell is 1.23 V and the cell potential is 0.98 V at 25°C? The cell operates with a current of 2.5 amps for 2 hours and the electrolyte solution contains 0.2 moles of solute with a total volume of 1000 mL.\"",
    "message_2": "To calculate the efficiency of the electrochemical cell, we need to find the ratio of the actual cell potential to the maximum cell potential (emf). \n\nEfficiency = (Actual cell potential / Maximum cell potential) × 100\n\nGiven:\nActual cell potential = 0.98 V\nMaximum cell potential (emf) = 1.23 V\n\nEfficiency = (0.98 V / 1.23 V) × 100\nEfficiency = 0.7967 × 100\nEfficiency = 79.67%\n\nSo, the efficiency of the electrochemical cell is approximately 79.67%."
