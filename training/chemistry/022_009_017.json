    "message_2": "In a double replacement reaction, the cations and anions of the two reactants switch places to form two new products. When sodium chloride (NaCl) reacts with silver nitrate (AgNO3), the products formed are silver chloride (AgCl) and sodium nitrate (NaNO3). The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nNaCl (aq) + AgNO3 (aq) â†’ AgCl (s) + NaNO3 (aq)"
