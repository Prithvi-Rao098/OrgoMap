The equation for the reaction is: 2K + Cl2 â†’ 2KCl. (Hint: use stoichiometry to determine the limiting reagent and the theoretical yield of potassium chloride.)",
    "message_2": "First, we need to determine the limiting reagent. To do this, we will use the stoichiometry of the balanced chemical equation and the molar masses of the elements involved.\n\nMolar mass of potassium (K) = 39.10 g/mol\nMolar mass of chlorine (Cl2) = 2 * 35.45 g/mol = 70.90 g/mol\nMolar mass of potassium chloride (KCl) = 39.10 g/mol + 35.45 g/mol = 74.55 g/mol\n\nNow, we will calculate the moles of each reactant:\n\nMoles of potassium (K) = 5.0 g / 39.10 g/mol = 0.128 mol\nMoles of chlorine (Cl2) = 7.5 g / 70.90 g/mol = 0.106 mol\n\nNext, we will determine the mole ratio of the reactants:\n\nMole ratio of K to Cl2 = (0.128 mol K) / (0.106 mol Cl2) = 1.21\n\nThe balanced chemical equation shows that the mole ratio of K to Cl2 should be 2:1. Since the calculated mole ratio (1.21) is less than 2, potassium (K) is the limiting reagent.\n\nNow, we will use stoichiometry to determine the theoretical yield of potassium chloride (KCl):\n\nFrom the balanced equation, 2 moles of K react with 1 mole of Cl2 to produce 2 moles of KCl.\n\nMoles of KCl produced = 0.128 mol K * (2 mol KCl / 2 mol K) = 0.128 mol KCl\n\nFinally, we will convert the moles of KCl to grams:\n\nMass of KCl = 0.128 mol KCl * 74.55 g/mol KCl = 9.54 g\n\nTherefore, the mass of potassium chloride that can be formed from 5.0 grams of potassium and 7.5 grams of chlorine gas is 9.54 grams."
