    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use stoichiometry. First, let's write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nAcetanilide + Br2 â†’ 4-bromoacetanilide\n\nNow, we need to find the molecular weights of the reactants and products:\n\n- Acetanilide (C8H9NO): (12.01 * 8) + (1.01 * 9) + (14.01) + (16.00) = 135.17 g/mol\n- 4-bromoacetanilide (C8H8BrNO): 135.17 + 79.90 (Br) = 215.07 g/mol\n- Bromine (Br2): 2 * 79.90 = 159.80 g/mol\n\nNext, we need to determine the moles of 4-bromoacetanilide that we want to prepare:\n\n10 g 4-bromoacetanilide * (1 mol / 215.07 g) = 0.0465 mol 4-bromoacetanilide\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, we need the same amount of moles of bromine:\n\n0.0465 mol 4-bromoacetanilide * (1 mol Br2 / 1 mol 4-bromoacetanilide) = 0.0465 mol Br2\n\nNow, we can find the mass of bromine required:\n\n0.0465 mol Br2 * (159.80 g / mol) = 7.43 g Br2\n\nTherefore, 7.43 grams of bromine are required to prepare 10 grams of 4-bromoacetanilide."
