    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change of the oxidation of glucose, we need to use Hess's Law, which states that the total enthalpy change of a reaction is the sum of the enthalpy changes of formation of the products minus the sum of the enthalpy changes of formation of the reactants.\n\nIn this case, the balanced chemical equation is:\n\nC6H12O6 + 6O2 -> 6CO2 + 6H2O\n\nWe are given the enthalpy of formation of glucose (C6H12O6) as -1273 kJ/mol and the enthalpy of formation of water (H2O) as -286 kJ/mol. We also need the enthalpy of formation of carbon dioxide (CO2), which is -393.5 kJ/mol.\n\nNow we can apply Hess's Law:\n\nΔH = [6(-393.5) + 6(-286)] - [-1273]\n\nΔH = [-2361 + (-1716)] - (-1273)\n\nΔH = -4077 + 1273\n\nΔH = -2804 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the enthalpy change of the oxidation of glucose is -2804 kJ/mol."
