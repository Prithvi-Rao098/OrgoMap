    "message_2": "When sodium chloride (NaCl) reacts with silver nitrate (AgNO₃), a double replacement reaction occurs, and the products formed are silver chloride (AgCl) and sodium nitrate (NaNO₃). The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nNaCl (aq) + AgNO₃ (aq) → AgCl (s) + NaNO₃ (aq)"
