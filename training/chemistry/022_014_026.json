    "message_1": "A chemistry student has two containers, one with 25 grams of hydrogen gas and the other with 35 grams of oxygen gas. What mass of water can be produced when these two gases undergo a reaction and which gas is the limiting reactant?",
    "message_2": "To determine the limiting reactant and the mass of water produced, we need to use the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between hydrogen gas and oxygen gas to form water:\n\n2 H₂(g) + O₂(g) → 2 H₂O(l)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of each reactant to moles using their molar masses:\n\nMolar mass of H₂ = 2.02 g/mol\nMolar mass of O₂ = 32.00 g/mol\n\nMoles of H₂ = 25 g / 2.02 g/mol = 12.38 mol\nMoles of O₂ = 35 g / 32.00 g/mol = 1.09 mol\n\nNow, we need to determine the mole ratio of the reactants:\n\nMole ratio of H₂ to O₂ = 12.38 mol / 1.09 mol = 11.36\n\nThe balanced chemical equation tells us that the mole ratio of H₂ to O₂ should be 2:1 for the reaction to proceed completely. Since the actual mole ratio is 11.36, which is greater than 2, this means that there is an excess of hydrogen gas, and oxygen gas is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow, we can calculate the mass of water produced using the stoichiometry of the balanced equation:\n\nMoles of H₂O produced = 2 * moles of O₂ = 2 * 1.09 mol = 2.18 mol\n\nMolar mass of H₂O = 18.02 g/mol\n\nMass of H₂O produced = 2.18 mol * 18.02 g/mol = 39.24 g\n\nSo, the mass of water that can be produced is 39.24 grams, and the limiting reactant is oxygen gas."
