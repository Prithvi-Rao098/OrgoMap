    "message_1": "What would be the mass of 2,4-dinitrophenol that can be prepared by using 25 grams of phenol and 50 mL of 70% nitric acid in the synthesis reaction? (Assuming 100% yield and the density of 70% nitric acid to be 1.42 g/mL)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to first determine the limiting reagent and then calculate the mass of 2,4-dinitrophenol that can be prepared.\n\n1. Calculate the moles of phenol and nitric acid.\nMolecular weight of phenol (C6H5OH) = 6(12.01) + 6(1.01) + 16.00 + 1.01 = 94.11 g/mol\nMoles of phenol = mass / molecular weight = 25 g / 94.11 g/mol = 0.2657 mol\n\nFor nitric acid, we first need to find the mass of nitric acid in the 50 mL solution.\nMass of 70% nitric acid solution = volume × density = 50 mL × 1.42 g/mL = 71 g\nMass of nitric acid (HNO3) in the solution = 0.70 × 71 g = 49.7 g\n\nMolecular weight of nitric acid (HNO3) = 1.01 + 14.01 + 3(16.00) = 63.01 g/mol\nMoles of nitric acid = mass / molecular weight = 49.7 g / 63.01 g/mol = 0.7891 mol\n\n2. Determine the limiting reagent.\nThe balanced chemical equation for the synthesis of 2,4-dinitrophenol is:\n\nC6H5OH + 2 HNO3 → C6H3N2O5 + 2 H2O\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of phenol reacts with 2 moles of nitric acid. Therefore, we need to compare the mole ratio of phenol to nitric acid to determine the limiting reagent.\n\nMole ratio of phenol to nitric acid = 0.2657 mol / 0.7891 mol = 0.3368\n\nSince the mole ratio is less than 0.5 (which is the stoichiometric ratio), phenol is the limiting reagent.\n\n3. Calculate the mass of 2,4-dinitrophenol that can be prepared.\nMolecular weight of 2,4-dinitrophenol (C6H3N2O5) = 6(12.01) + 3(1.01) + 2(14.01) + 5(16.00) = 184.11 g/mol\n\nUsing the moles of the limiting reagent (phenol), we can calculate the moles of 2,4-dinitrophenol produced:\n\nMoles of 2,4-dinitrophenol = 0.2657 mol (1:1 ratio with phenol)\n\nMass of 2,4-dinitrophenol = moles × molecular weight = 0.2657 mol × 184.11 g/mol = 48.88 g\n\nTherefore, the mass of 2,4-dinitrophenol that can be prepared is 48.88 grams, assuming a 100% yield."
