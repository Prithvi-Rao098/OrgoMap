    "message_2": "To modify the chemical structure and properties of existing drugs to selectively target cancer cells over healthy cells in the treatment of a specific type of cancer, several strategies can be employed:\n\n1. Targeting specific cancer cell receptors: Cancer cells often overexpress certain receptors or proteins on their surface that are not present or are present in lower amounts on healthy cells. By modifying the drug to bind specifically to these overexpressed receptors, the drug can be selectively delivered to cancer cells. This can be achieved by attaching a targeting ligand or antibody to the drug molecule, which will recognize and bind to the specific receptor on the cancer cell.\n\n2. Exploiting differences in cancer cell metabolism: Cancer cells have altered metabolism compared to healthy cells, which can be exploited for selective drug targeting. For example, cancer cells often have a higher demand for certain nutrients or display increased activity of specific enzymes. By designing drugs that are activated or released only in the presence of these altered metabolic conditions, the drug can selectively target cancer cells.\n\n3. Utilizing prodrugs: Prodrugs are inactive forms of a drug that are converted into their active form by specific enzymes or conditions present in the cancer cells. By designing prodrugs that are selectively activated in cancer cells, the drug can be targeted to these cells while minimizing damage to healthy cells.\n\n4. Employing nanoparticle drug delivery systems: Nanoparticles can be designed to encapsulate the drug and release it selectively in the tumor microenvironment. This can be achieved by modifying the surface of the nanoparticles with targeting ligands or by designing nanoparticles that are sensitive to the unique conditions of the tumor microenvironment, such as pH or enzyme levels.\n\n5. Using combination therapies: Combining drugs with different mechanisms of action or targeting different aspects of cancer cell biology can increase the selectivity and efficacy of treatment. For example, combining a drug that targets a specific cancer cell receptor with a drug that targets a specific metabolic pathway in cancer cells can increase the selectivity of the treatment.\n\nIn summary, modifying the chemical structure and properties of existing drugs to selectively target cancer cells over healthy cells can be achieved through various strategies, including targeting specific cancer cell receptors, exploiting differences in cancer cell metabolism, utilizing prodrugs, employing nanoparticle drug delivery systems, and using combination therapies. These approaches can help improve the efficacy and safety of cancer treatments."
