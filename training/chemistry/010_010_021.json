    "message_1": "Calculate the power output of a galvanic cell given that the cell potential is 1.8 V and the current passing through the circuit is 2.5 A. The electrochemical reaction taking place in the cell is the oxidation of Zinc and reduction of Copper. The standard reduction potentials are +0.76 V for copper and -0.76 V for zinc. The concentration of Zinc ions is 1.0 M whereas Copper ions concentration is 0.1 M. Determine the power output of the cell.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the power output of the galvanic cell, we can use the formula:\n\nPower (P) = Voltage (V) × Current (I)\n\nGiven that the cell potential (voltage) is 1.8 V and the current passing through the circuit is 2.5 A, we can calculate the power output as follows:\n\nP = 1.8 V × 2.5 A\nP = 4.5 W\n\nTherefore, the power output of the galvanic cell is 4.5 watts."
