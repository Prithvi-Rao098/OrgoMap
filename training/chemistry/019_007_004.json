    "message_2": "To calculate the reaction quotient Q for the given reaction, we need to use the expression for Q based on the balanced chemical equation and the given concentrations of reactants and products.\n\nFor the reaction:\n\n2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(g)\n\nThe expression for Q is:\n\nQ = [H2O]^2 / ([H2]^2 * [O2])\n\nNow, we can plug in the given concentrations:\n\n[H2] = 0.25 M\n[O2] = 0.15 M\n[H2O] = 0.20 M\n\nQ = (0.20)^2 / ((0.25)^2 * (0.15))\n\nQ = 0.04 / (0.0625 * 0.15)\n\nQ = 0.04 / 0.009375\n\nQ ≈ 4.27\n\nThe value of the reaction quotient Q for the given reaction at 25°C is approximately 4.27."
