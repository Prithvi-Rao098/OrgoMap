    "message_2": "To prepare 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine from hydrazine and 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene, follow this procedure:\n\n1. Reagents and materials needed:\n   - Hydrazine hydrate (N2H4·H2O)\n   - 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (C6H3ClN2O4)\n   - Ethanol (C2H5OH)\n   - Glacial acetic acid (CH3COOH)\n   - Round-bottom flask\n   - Reflux condenser\n   - Separatory funnel\n   - Filter paper\n   - Vacuum filtration setup\n\n2. Procedure:\n   a. In a round-bottom flask, dissolve an appropriate amount of hydrazine hydrate in ethanol. The amount of hydrazine hydrate should be in a slight excess compared to the stoichiometric ratio with 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene.\n   \n   b. In a separate round-bottom flask, dissolve an appropriate amount of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene in glacial acetic acid. The amount of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene should be based on the desired yield of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine.\n   \n   c. Slowly add the hydrazine hydrate solution to the 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene solution while stirring. The reaction is exothermic, so it is essential to control the temperature and avoid overheating. The reaction can be represented by the following equation:\n   \n      C6H3ClN2O4 + N2H4·H2O → C6H3N4O4 + HCl + H2O\n   \n   d. After the addition is complete, attach a reflux condenser to the round-bottom flask and heat the mixture under reflux for about 1 hour. This step ensures the completion of the reaction.\n   \n   e. Allow the reaction mixture to cool to room temperature. The product, 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, will precipitate as orange-red crystals.\n   \n   f. Filter the crystals using vacuum filtration. Wash the crystals with a small amount of cold ethanol to remove any remaining impurities.\n   \n   g. Dry the crystals in air or in a vacuum desiccator to obtain the final product, 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine.\n\n3. Safety precautions:\n   - Hydrazine hydrate is toxic and corrosive. Handle it with care and use appropriate personal protective equipment (gloves, goggles, lab coat).\n   - 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene is toxic and a potential carcinogen. Handle it with care and use appropriate personal protective equipment.\n   - Perform the reaction in a well-ventilated area or a fume hood to avoid inhaling any harmful vapors."
