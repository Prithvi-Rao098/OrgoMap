    "message_2": "To find the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid, we can use the formula for the acid dissociation constant (Ka):\n\nKa = [H+][A-]/[HA]\n\nWhere [H+] is the concentration of hydrogen ions, [A-] is the concentration of acetate ions, and [HA] is the concentration of acetic acid.\n\nSince the initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.1 M, we can assume that the concentration of hydrogen ions and acetate ions will be equal (x) at equilibrium:\n\nKa = x^2 / (0.1 - x)\n\nGiven that Ka = 1.8 x 10^-5, we can solve for x:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 = x^2 / (0.1 - x)\n\nSince the value of Ka is very small, we can assume that x is much smaller than 0.1, so we can approximate the equation as:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 ≈ x^2 / 0.1\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx^2 ≈ 1.8 x 10^-5 * 0.1\nx^2 ≈ 1.8 x 10^-6\nx ≈ √(1.8 x 10^-6)\nx ≈ 1.34 x 10^-3\n\nNow that we have the concentration of hydrogen ions [H+], we can find the pH using the formula:\n\npH = -log[H+]\n\npH = -log(1.34 x 10^-3)\npH ≈ 2.87\n\nSo, the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid with a Ka of 1.8 x 10^-5 at 298 K is approximately 2.87."
