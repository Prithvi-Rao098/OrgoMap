(Assume the reaction takes place in an aqueous solution with a standard electrode potential of 0.34 V at 25°C.)",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of electrons transferred in this reaction, we first need to write the balanced redox equation for the reaction between zinc ions (Zn2+) and copper metal (Cu) to form solid copper ions (Cu2+) and zinc metal (Zn).\n\nThe half-reactions for this redox reaction are:\n\nOxidation half-reaction (Cu to Cu2+): Cu(s) → Cu2+(aq) + 2e⁻\nReduction half-reaction (Zn2+ to Zn): Zn2+(aq) + 2e⁻ → Zn(s)\n\nNow, we can combine these half-reactions to form the balanced redox equation:\n\nCu(s) + Zn2+(aq) → Cu2+(aq) + Zn(s)\n\nFrom the balanced redox equation, we can see that 2 moles of electrons are transferred for every mole of zinc ions reacting with copper metal. Since we have 0.2 moles of zinc ions reacting, we can calculate the number of electrons transferred as follows:\n\nNumber of electrons transferred = moles of Zn2+ × moles of electrons per mole of Zn2+\nNumber of electrons transferred = 0.2 moles × 2 moles of electrons\nNumber of electrons transferred = 0.4 moles of electrons\n\nTherefore, 0.4 moles of electrons are transferred when 0.2 moles of zinc ions react with an excess of copper metal to form solid copper ions and zinc metal."
