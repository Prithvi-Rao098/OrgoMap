    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the ionization of acetic acid (CH₃COOH) in water, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nCH₃COOH (aq) + H₂O (l) ⇌ CH₃COO⁻ (aq) + H₃O⁺ (aq)\n\nNow, we can write the expression for the equilibrium constant (Kc):\n\nKc = [CH₃COO⁻][H₃O⁺] / [CH₃COOH]\n\nWe are given the concentrations of acetic acid ([CH₃COOH]) and its conjugate base ([CH₃COO⁻]):\n\n[CH₃COOH] = 0.25 M\n[CH₃COO⁻] = 0.10 M\n\nSince the reaction is at equilibrium, the concentration of hydronium ions ([H₃O⁺]) will be equal to the concentration of the conjugate base ([CH₃COO⁻]):\n\n[H₃O⁺] = 0.10 M\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Kc expression:\n\nKc = (0.10)(0.10) / (0.25)\nKc = 0.01 / 0.25\nKc ≈ 0.04\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the ionization of acetic acid in water at this given temperature is approximately 0.04."
