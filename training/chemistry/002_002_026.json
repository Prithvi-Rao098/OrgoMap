    "message_2": "In the compound MnO2, the oxidation state of manganese (Mn) is +4.\n\nHere's the explanation: Oxygen has an oxidation state of -2. Since there are two oxygen atoms in the compound, their total oxidation state is -4. To balance the overall charge of the compound, the oxidation state of manganese (Mn) must be +4."
