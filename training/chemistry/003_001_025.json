    "message_2": "To calculate the change in enthalpy for the combustion of 2 moles of methane gas (CH4), we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the combustion reaction:\n\nCH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(l)\n\nNext, we need the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) for all the reactants and products involved in the reaction. The given standard enthalpy of formation for methane is -74.81 kJ/mol. The standard enthalpies of formation for the other substances are:\n\nO2(g): 0 kJ/mol (since it's an element in its standard state)\nCO2(g): -393.5 kJ/mol\nH2O(l): -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nNow we can use Hess's Law to calculate the change in enthalpy (ΔH) for the reaction:\n\nΔH = Σ [ΔHf°(products)] - Σ [ΔHf°(reactants)]\n\nΔH = [1 mol × (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 mol × (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [1 mol × (-74.81 kJ/mol) + 2 mol × 0 kJ/mol]\n\nΔH = (-393.5 kJ + 2 × -285.8 kJ) - (-74.81 kJ)\n\nΔH = (-393.5 kJ - 571.6 kJ) + 74.81 kJ\n\nΔH = -890.29 kJ\n\nHowever, this is the enthalpy change for the combustion of 1 mole of methane. Since we are asked to calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of 2 moles of methane, we need to multiply the result by 2:\n\nΔH (2 moles of CH4) = 2 × -890.29 kJ = -1780.58 kJ\n\nSo, the change in enthalpy for the combustion of 2 moles of methane gas (CH4) at a constant pressure of 1 atmosphere and a temperature of 298 K is -1780.58 kJ."
