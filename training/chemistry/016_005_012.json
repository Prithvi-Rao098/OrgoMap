    "message_1": "What is the enthalpy of combustion of methanol (CH3OH) in kJ/mol? Given that the balanced equation for its combustion is:\n\n2CH3OH(l) + 3O2(g) → 2CO2(g) + 4H2O(l)\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation of CO2(g) and H2O(l) are -394 kJ/mol and -286 kJ/mol, respectively. The heat of combustion of methanol is -726.4 kJ/mol at 298 K and 1 atm pressure.",
    "message_2": "The enthalpy of combustion of methanol (CH3OH) can be calculated using the standard enthalpies of formation of the products and reactants in the balanced equation. The balanced equation is:\n\n2CH3OH(l) + 3O2(g) → 2CO2(g) + 4H2O(l)\n\nUsing the given standard enthalpies of formation for CO2(g) and H2O(l), we can calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nΔH_combustion = [Σ ΔH_f(products)] - [Σ ΔH_f(reactants)]\n\nFor the products, we have 2 moles of CO2(g) and 4 moles of H2O(l):\n\nΔH_f(products) = (2 mol × -394 kJ/mol) + (4 mol × -286 kJ/mol) = -788 kJ + (-1144 kJ) = -1932 kJ\n\nFor the reactants, we have 2 moles of CH3OH(l) and 3 moles of O2(g). The standard enthalpy of formation for O2(g) is 0 kJ/mol since it is in its elemental form. The standard enthalpy of formation for CH3OH(l) is not given, but the heat of combustion of methanol is provided as -726.4 kJ/mol. Since the balanced equation involves 2 moles of CH3OH, the total heat of combustion for the reactants is:\n\nΔH_f(reactants) = (2 mol × -726.4 kJ/mol) + (3 mol × 0 kJ/mol) = -1452.8 kJ\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy of combustion:\n\nΔH_combustion = (-1932 kJ) - (-1452.8 kJ) = -479.2 kJ\n\nSince the balanced equation involves 2 moles of CH3OH, we need to divide the enthalpy of combustion by 2 to obtain the enthalpy of combustion per mole of methanol:\n\nΔH_combustion (per mole of CH3OH) = -479.2 kJ / 2 = -239.6 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy of combustion of methanol (CH3OH) is -239.6 kJ/mol."
