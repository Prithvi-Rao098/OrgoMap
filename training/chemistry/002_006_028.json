    "message_2": "To find the molar mass of barium sulfate (BaSO4), we need to add the molar masses of each element in the compound.\n\nBarium (Ba) has a molar mass of 137.33 g/mol.\nSulfur (S) has a molar mass of 32.07 g/mol.\nOxygen (O) has a molar mass of 16.00 g/mol.\n\nThe formula for barium sulfate is BaSO4, which means it has one barium atom, one sulfur atom, and four oxygen atoms.\n\nSo, the molar mass of barium sulfate is:\n\n(1 × 137.33 g/mol) + (1 × 32.07 g/mol) + (4 × 16.00 g/mol) = 137.33 + 32.07 + 64.00 = 233.40 g/mol\n\nThe molar mass of barium sulfate (BaSO4) is 233.40 g/mol."
