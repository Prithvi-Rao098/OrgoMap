    "message_2": "In humans, excess amino acids are metabolized through a process called deamination. Deamination involves the removal of the amino group from the amino acid, which is then converted into ammonia (NH3). The liver plays a crucial role in this process, as it is the primary site for amino acid metabolism.\n\nThe ammonia produced during deamination is toxic to the body, so it is converted into a less toxic compound called urea through the urea cycle. Urea is then transported through the bloodstream to the kidneys, where it is excreted in the urine.\n\nThe remaining carbon skeleton, after the removal of the amino group, can be converted into various useful compounds, such as glucose, fatty acids, or other intermediates of the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle). This process is called gluconeogenesis when it leads to glucose production, and lipogenesis when it leads to fatty acid production.\n\nAmino acid imbalances can have various consequences on the body. For example, a deficiency in essential amino acids (those that cannot be synthesized by the body and must be obtained through diet) can lead to impaired growth, muscle wasting, and other health issues. On the other hand, an excess of certain amino acids can also be harmful. For instance, excessive intake of methionine, an essential amino acid, can lead to elevated levels of homocysteine, which is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases.\n\nPhenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disorder that exemplifies the consequences of amino acid imbalances. Individuals with PKU lack the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which is responsible for converting the amino acid phenylalanine into tyrosine. As a result, phenylalanine accumulates in the body and can cause intellectual disabilities, seizures, and other neurological problems if not managed through a strict low-phenylalanine diet.\n\nThe process of amino acid metabolism is closely related to overall health and disease prevention. Proper intake and balance of amino acids are essential for the synthesis of proteins, which are crucial for various bodily functions, such as enzyme production, immune system function, and tissue repair. Additionally, the products of amino acid metabolism, such as glucose and fatty acids, are important energy sources for the body.\n\nIn conclusion, the metabolic fate of excess amino acids in humans involves deamination, conversion of ammonia to urea, and the production of useful compounds like glucose and fatty acids. Amino acid imbalances can have various consequences on health, and maintaining a proper balance is essential for overall health and disease prevention."
