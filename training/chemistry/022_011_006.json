    "message_2": "To determine the volume of oxygen gas required for the complete combustion of 1.5 liters of acetylene gas, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the combustion reaction:\n\nC2H2 + O2 → CO2 + H2O\n\nHowever, this equation is not balanced yet. The balanced equation is:\n\n2 C2H2 + 5 O2 → 4 CO2 + 2 H2O\n\nNow, we can use the stoichiometry of the balanced equation to determine the volume of oxygen gas required. Since the volume ratios of gases are proportional to their mole ratios at STP, we can use the coefficients in the balanced equation to find the volume ratio:\n\nVolume ratio of C2H2 to O2 = 2 : 5\n\nGiven that we have 1.5 liters of acetylene gas (C2H2), we can calculate the volume of oxygen gas (O2) required:\n\n(1.5 L C2H2) × (5 L O2 / 2 L C2H2) = 3.75 L O2\n\nTherefore, 3.75 liters of oxygen gas are required for the complete combustion of 1.5 liters of acetylene gas at STP."
