    "message_2": "To calculate the bond order and bond length of the nitrogen-oxygen bond in the nitrate ion (NO3-), we first need to determine the resonance structures of the ion.\n\nResonance structures of NO3-:\n\n1. O = N - O^(-) - O^(-)\n2. O^(-) - N = O - O^(-)\n3. O^(-) - O^(-) - N = O\n\nThere are three resonance structures for the nitrate ion, and each nitrogen-oxygen bond is a single bond in one structure and a double bond in another. To calculate the bond order, we can average the bond orders across the three resonance structures.\n\nBond order = (Total number of bonds in all resonance structures) / (Total number of resonance structures × number of N-O bonds per structure)\n\nBond order = (1 + 2 + 1) / (3 × 1) = 4 / 3 ≈ 1.33\n\nThe bond order of the nitrogen-oxygen bond in the nitrate ion is approximately 1.33.\n\nNow, let's calculate the bond length. The bond length of a molecule is inversely proportional to the bond order. As the bond order increases, the bond length decreases. We can use the known bond lengths of single and double nitrogen-oxygen bonds to estimate the bond length in the nitrate ion.\n\nThe average bond length of a single N-O bond is approximately 1.47 Å, and the average bond length of a double N=O bond is approximately 1.22 Å. We can use these values to estimate the bond length of the nitrogen-oxygen bond in the nitrate ion by taking a weighted average based on the bond order.\n\nBond length (NO3-) ≈ (1.33 - 1) × (1.22 Å - 1.47 Å) / (2 - 1) + 1.47 Å\nBond length (NO3-) ≈ 0.33 × (-0.25 Å) + 1.47 Å\nBond length (NO3-) ≈ -0.0825 Å + 1.47 Å\nBond length (NO3-) ≈ 1.3875 Å\n\nThe bond length of the nitrogen-oxygen bond in the nitrate ion is approximately 1.39 Å."
