    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat absorbed or released when 4.50 moles of H2O(l) is formed under standard conditions, we can use the following equation:\n\nq = n × ΔHf\n\nwhere q is the heat absorbed or released, n is the number of moles, and ΔHf is the standard enthalpy change of formation.\n\nGiven that the standard enthalpy change of formation for H2O(l) is -285.8 kJ/mol, and we want to find the heat absorbed or released when 4.50 moles of H2O(l) is formed:\n\nq = (4.50 moles) × (-285.8 kJ/mol)\n\nq = -1286.1 kJ\n\nSince the value is negative, it means that the reaction is exothermic, and 1286.1 kJ of heat is released when 4.50 moles of H2O(l) is formed under standard conditions."
