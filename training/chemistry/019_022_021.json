    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction, we need to determine the moles of each substance and then use the heat evolved (q) to find the enthalpy change per mole.\n\nFirst, let's find the moles of each substance:\n\nMolar mass of ethyl alcohol (C2H5OH) = 2(12.01) + 6(1.01) + 1(16.00) = 46.07 g/mol\nMoles of ethyl alcohol = mass / molar mass = 10 g / 46.07 g/mol = 0.217 mol\n\nMolar mass of water (H2O) = 2(1.01) + 1(16.00) = 18.02 g/mol\nMoles of water = mass / molar mass = 25 g / 18.02 g/mol = 1.387 mol\n\nNow, we can use the heat evolved (q) to find the enthalpy change per mole. Since the heat evolved is 12.5 kJ, the enthalpy change for the reaction is -12.5 kJ (exothermic reaction).\n\nTo find the enthalpy change per mole, we need to divide the total enthalpy change by the total moles of reactants:\n\nTotal moles = moles of ethyl alcohol + moles of water = 0.217 mol + 1.387 mol = 1.604 mol\n\nEnthalpy change per mole = total enthalpy change / total moles = -12.5 kJ / 1.604 mol = -7.79 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the reaction of mixing 10g of ethyl alcohol with 25g of water at 25°C is -7.79 kJ/mol."
