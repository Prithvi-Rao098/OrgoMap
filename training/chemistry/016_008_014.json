    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat absorbed in the process of melting 10 grams of ice at 0°C, we will use the formula:\n\nq = n × ΔHf\n\nwhere q is the heat absorbed, n is the number of moles of ice, and ΔHf is the enthalpy of fusion of ice.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of ice. The molar mass of water (H₂O) is approximately 18.015 g/mol. \n\nn = mass / molar mass\nn = 10 g / 18.015 g/mol\nn ≈ 0.555 mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat absorbed:\n\nq = n × ΔHf\nq = 0.555 mol × 6.01 kJ/mol\nq ≈ 3.34 kJ\n\nThe amount of heat absorbed in the process of melting 10 grams of ice at 0°C is approximately 3.34 kJ, rounded off to two significant figures."
