    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise problem for the student to solve:\n\nCalculate the enthalpy change for the reaction where 2 moles of hydrogen gas (H2) reacts with 1 mole of oxygen gas (O2) to produce 2 moles of water (H2O). The standard enthalpies of formation for H2, O2, and H2O are -285.8 kJ/mol, 0 kJ/mol, and -241.8 kJ/mol, respectively.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the following formula:\n\nΔH = Σ ΔHf(products) - Σ ΔHf(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH is the enthalpy change, and ΔHf is the standard enthalpy of formation.\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\n2 H2 (g) + O2 (g) → 2 H2O (l)\n\nThe standard enthalpies of formation are:\n\nH2: -285.8 kJ/mol\nO2: 0 kJ/mol\nH2O: -241.8 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nΔH = [2 × (-241.8)] - [2 × (-285.8) + 1 × 0]\n\nΔH = (-483.6) - (-571.6)\n\nΔH = 88 kJ\n\nSo, the enthalpy change for the reaction is 88 kJ."
