    "message_2": "To determine the equilibrium constant (K) of the reaction between iodine (I2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), we first need to know the balanced chemical equation for the reaction. The reaction between iodine and hydrogen peroxide can be represented as:\n\n2 I2 + 2 H2O2 → 4 HI + O2\n\nNow, we can use the initial concentrations of I2 and H2O2 and the rate constant (k) to determine the equilibrium concentrations of the reactants and products. Since we are given the rate constant (k) and not the equilibrium constant (K), we need to use the integrated rate law to determine the equilibrium concentrations.\n\nFor a second-order reaction, the integrated rate law is:\n\n1/[A]t = kt + 1/[A]0\n\nwhere [A]t is the concentration of A at time t, [A]0 is the initial concentration of A, and k is the rate constant.\n\nLet's assume that x moles of I2 and H2O2 react to reach equilibrium. Then, the equilibrium concentrations of the reactants and products will be:\n\n[I2] = 0.025 - x\n[H2O2] = 0.050 - x\n[HI] = 2x\n[O2] = x\n\nNow, we can use the rate constant (k) to determine the value of x:\n\n1.5 x 10^-3 = (0.025 - x)(0.050 - x)\n\nSolving for x, we get x ≈ 0.0125.\n\nNow, we can find the equilibrium concentrations of the reactants and products:\n\n[I2] = 0.025 - 0.0125 = 0.0125 M\n[H2O2] = 0.050 - 0.0125 = 0.0375 M\n[HI] = 2(0.0125) = 0.025 M\n[O2] = 0.0125 M\n\nFinally, we can determine the equilibrium constant (K) using the equilibrium concentrations:\n\nK = [HI]^4 * [O2] / ([I2]^2 * [H2O2]^2)\nK = (0.025^4 * 0.0125) / (0.0125^2 * 0.0375^2)\n\nK ≈ 2.56\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium constant of the reaction between iodine and hydrogen peroxide at 25°C is approximately 2.56."
