    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic moment of the compound Ni(CO)4, we first need to determine the electronic configuration of the central metal ion, which is nickel in this case.\n\nNickel (Ni) has an atomic number of 28, and its ground state electronic configuration is [Ar] 3d^8 4s^2. In Ni(CO)4, nickel is in the +0 oxidation state, as CO is a neutral ligand. Therefore, the electronic configuration of Ni in Ni(CO)4 remains the same as its ground state, which is [Ar] 3d^8 4s^2.\n\nNow, we need to consider the crystal field theory. In Ni(CO)4, the coordination geometry around the Ni atom is tetrahedral. In a tetrahedral crystal field, the d-orbitals split into two sets: the lower energy set (dxy, dxz, dyz) and the higher energy set (dz^2, dx^2-y^2). However, CO is a strong field ligand and causes the pairing of electrons in the d-orbitals.\n\nIn the case of Ni(CO)4, the 3d^8 electronic configuration in a tetrahedral crystal field would result in the following distribution of electrons:\n\nLower energy set (dxy, dxz, dyz): ↑↓ ↑↓ ↑↓\nHigher energy set (dz^2, dx^2-y^2): ↑↓ ↑\n\nAs we can see, all the d-orbitals are filled with paired electrons, and there are no unpaired electrons in the 4s orbital either.\n\nThe magnetic moment (μ) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nμ = √(n(n+2)) μB\n\nwhere n is the number of unpaired electrons, and μB is the Bohr magneton.\n\nSince there are no unpaired electrons in Ni(CO)4 (n = 0), the magnetic moment will be:\n\nμ = √(0(0+2)) μB = 0 μB\n\nA magnetic moment of 0 μB indicates that the compound is diamagnetic, as there are no unpaired electrons to contribute to a net magnetic moment. Therefore, Ni(CO)4 is a diamagnetic compound."
