    "message_2": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a linear molecule with a carbon atom in the center and two oxygen atoms on either side. There are three fundamental molecular vibrations in CO2, which can be classified as follows:\n\n1. Symmetric Stretching (v1): In this mode, both oxygen atoms move away from or towards the central carbon atom simultaneously, while the carbon atom remains stationary. This vibration is symmetric and does not result in a change in the molecule's dipole moment. As a result, it is not infrared (IR) active and does not contribute to the infrared spectrum of CO2.\n\n2. Bending (v2): In this mode, the molecule bends in a plane, with the carbon atom acting as the pivot point and the two oxygen atoms moving in opposite directions. This vibration is degenerate, meaning it has two equivalent forms: bending in the plane (scissoring) and bending out of the plane (rocking). Both forms result in a change in the molecule's dipole moment, making them IR active and contributing to the infrared spectrum of CO2.\n\n3. Asymmetric Stretching (v3): In this mode, one oxygen atom moves away from the carbon atom while the other moves towards it, resulting in an asymmetric stretching motion. This vibration leads to a change in the molecule's dipole moment and is IR active, contributing to the infrared spectrum of CO2.\n\nIn summary, the molecular vibrations of carbon dioxide include symmetric stretching (v1), bending (v2), and asymmetric stretching (v3). The bending and asymmetric stretching vibrations are IR active and contribute to the infrared spectrum of CO2, while the symmetric stretching vibration does not. These IR-active vibrations play a significant role in the greenhouse effect, as they absorb and re-emit infrared radiation, trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere."
