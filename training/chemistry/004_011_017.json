    "message_2": "Based on the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy spectrum provided, compound X has a singlet at 3.8 ppm and a quartet at 1.2 ppm. This information suggests that the compound has two distinct types of protons in its structure.\n\nThe singlet at 3.8 ppm indicates that there is a group of protons that are not coupled to any neighboring protons. This could be due to the presence of a methyl group (CH3) or a methylene group (CH2) next to an electronegative atom such as oxygen or a halogen.\n\nThe quartet at 1.2 ppm indicates that there is a group of protons that are coupled to three neighboring protons. This is characteristic of a methylene group (CH2) that is adjacent to a methyl group (CH3).\n\nBased on this information, the structure of compound X is likely to be an ethyl group (CH3CH2-) attached to an electronegative atom, such as oxygen or a halogen. Some possible structures for compound X include:\n\n1. Ethyl alcohol (CH3CH2OH)\n2. Ethyl halides, such as ethyl chloride (CH3CH2Cl), ethyl bromide (CH3CH2Br), or ethyl iodide (CH3CH2I)\n\nTo determine the exact structure of compound X, additional information such as mass spectrometry data or infrared spectroscopy data would be needed."
