    "message_2": "To determine the rate law expression, we need to find the order of the reaction with respect to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and iodide ions (I^-). We can do this by comparing the initial rates and concentrations between different experiments.\n\nFirst, let's compare Experiment 1 and Experiment 2, where the concentration of iodide ions is constant, but the concentration of hydrogen peroxide is doubled:\n\nRate2 / Rate1 = (1.60 x 10^-3) / (2.00 x 10^-4) = 8\n\nSince the rate increased by a factor of 8 when the concentration of H2O2 doubled, the reaction is second order with respect to H2O2.\n\nNow, let's compare Experiment 2 and Experiment 3, where the concentration of hydrogen peroxide is constant, but the concentration of iodide ions is doubled:\n\nRate3 / Rate2 = (4.80 x 10^-3) / (1.60 x 10^-3) = 3\n\nSince the rate increased by a factor of 3 when the concentration of I^- doubled, the reaction is first order with respect to I^-.\n\nNow we can write the rate law expression:\n\nrate = k[H2O2]^2[I^-]^1\n\nor\n\nrate = k[H2O2]^2[I^-]"
