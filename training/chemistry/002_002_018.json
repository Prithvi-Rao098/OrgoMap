    "message_2": "In N2O5 (dinitrogen pentoxide), the oxidation state of nitrogen can be determined by considering the overall charge of the compound and the oxidation state of oxygen.\n\nThe overall charge of N2O5 is 0, as it is a neutral molecule. Oxygen typically has an oxidation state of -2. In N2O5, there are five oxygen atoms, each with an oxidation state of -2, which gives a total oxidation state of -10 for all the oxygen atoms combined.\n\nSince there are two nitrogen atoms in N2O5, let's represent the oxidation state of each nitrogen atom as x. The sum of the oxidation states of all atoms in the molecule should equal the overall charge of the molecule, which is 0 in this case.\n\nSo, the equation can be set up as:\n\n2x + (-10) = 0\n\nSolving for x:\n\n2x = 10\nx = 5\n\nThus, the oxidation state of nitrogen in N2O5 is +5."
