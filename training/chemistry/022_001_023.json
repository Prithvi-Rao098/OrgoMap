    "message_2": "To balance the chemical equation H2 + O2 -> H2O, we need to make sure that the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of the equation.\n\nH2 + O2 -> H2O\n\nThere are 2 hydrogen atoms on the left side and 2 hydrogen atoms on the right side, so the hydrogen atoms are already balanced. However, there are 2 oxygen atoms on the left side and only 1 oxygen atom on the right side.\n\nTo balance the oxygen atoms, we can add a coefficient of 2 in front of the H2O molecule:\n\nH2 + O2 -> 2H2O\n\nNow there are 2 oxygen atoms on both sides, but the hydrogen atoms are no longer balanced. There are 2 hydrogen atoms on the left side and 4 hydrogen atoms on the right side.\n\nTo balance the hydrogen atoms, we can add a coefficient of 2 in front of the H2 molecule:\n\n2H2 + O2 -> 2H2O\n\nNow the chemical equation is balanced, with 4 hydrogen atoms and 2 oxygen atoms on both sides."
