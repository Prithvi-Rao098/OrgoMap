    "message_1": "What is the efficiency of a galvanic cell that has a voltage of 1.5 V and a current of 0.5 A when it operates for 2 hours using a 0.5 M copper (II) sulfate solution as the cathode half-cell and a 1.0 M zinc sulfate solution as the anode half-cell?",
    "message_2": "To determine the efficiency of the galvanic cell, we first need to find the theoretical cell potential (E°cell) for the given half-cell reactions. The half-cell reactions are:\n\nCathode: Cu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Cu(s)  E°(Cu²⁺/Cu) = +0.34 V\nAnode: Zn(s) → Zn²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻  E°(Zn²⁺/Zn) = -0.76 V\n\nThe overall cell reaction is:\n\nCu²⁺(aq) + Zn(s) → Cu(s) + Zn²⁺(aq)\n\nThe theoretical cell potential (E°cell) is the difference between the cathode and anode potentials:\n\nE°cell = E°(Cu²⁺/Cu) - E°(Zn²⁺/Zn) = 0.34 V - (-0.76 V) = 1.10 V\n\nNow, we can calculate the efficiency of the galvanic cell by comparing the given voltage (1.5 V) to the theoretical cell potential (1.10 V):\n\nEfficiency = (Given Voltage / Theoretical Voltage) × 100%\nEfficiency = (1.5 V / 1.10 V) × 100% = 136.36%\n\nHowever, the efficiency of a galvanic cell cannot be greater than 100%. This discrepancy may be due to inaccuracies in the given voltage or other factors affecting the cell's performance. In practice, the efficiency of a galvanic cell is usually less than 100% due to factors such as internal resistance, concentration changes, and side reactions."
