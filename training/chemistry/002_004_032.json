    "message_2": "To calculate the pH of a 0.1 M solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl), we need to determine the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in the solution. Since HCl is a strong acid, it will dissociate completely in water, meaning that the concentration of H+ ions will be equal to the concentration of HCl.\n\nIn this case, the concentration of HCl is 0.1 M, so the concentration of H+ ions will also be 0.1 M.\n\nThe pH of a solution is calculated using the following formula:\n\npH = -log10[H+]\n\nwhere [H+] is the concentration of hydrogen ions in moles per liter (M).\n\nFor this problem:\n\npH = -log10(0.1)\npH = -(-1)\npH = 1\n\nThe pH of a 0.1 M solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl) is 1."
