    "message_2": "To determine the concentration of copper ions in the given sample using polarography, we need to use the Ilkovic equation:\n\nIp = (2.99 * n^1.5 * D^0.5 * A * C) / t^0.5\n\nwhere:\nIp = peak current (2.56 μA)\nn = number of electrons involved in the redox reaction (for Cu2+, n = 2)\nD = diffusion coefficient (for Cu2+, D ≈ 7.2 x 10^-6 cm^2/s)\nA = electrode area (we need this value to proceed)\nC = concentration of the copper ions (the value we want to find)\nt = time (we need this value to proceed)\n\nTo solve for the concentration (C), we need the values for electrode area (A) and time (t). Please provide these values so that we can calculate the concentration of copper ions in the sample."
