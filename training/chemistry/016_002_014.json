Given the following information: \n\n- ΔHf° (NH4NO3) = -365.4 kJ/mol\n- ΔHf° (HNO3) = -207.3 kJ/mol\n- ΔHf° (NH4+) = -132.5 kJ/mol\n- ΔHf° (NO3-) = -206.1 kJ/mol\n- ΔHf° (H2O) = -285.83 kJ/mol\n\nFormulate the thermochemical equation for the reaction by using the given data and Hess's Law calculations, and then calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between ammonium nitrate and water:\n\nNH4NO3 (s) + H2O (l) → NH4+ (aq) + NO3- (aq) + H2O (l)\n\nNow, we can use Hess's Law to determine the enthalpy change for the reaction. Hess's Law states that the enthalpy change for a reaction is equal to the sum of the enthalpy changes for the formation of the products minus the sum of the enthalpy changes for the formation of the reactants.\n\nΔH = [ΔHf° (NH4+) + ΔHf° (NO3-) + ΔHf° (H2O)] - [ΔHf° (NH4NO3) + ΔHf° (H2O)]\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\nΔH = [(-132.5 kJ/mol) + (-206.1 kJ/mol) + (-285.83 kJ/mol)] - [(-365.4 kJ/mol) + (-285.83 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH = [(-132.5 - 206.1 - 285.83) kJ/mol] - [(-365.4 - 285.83) kJ/mol]\n\nΔH = (-624.43 kJ/mol) - (-651.23 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH = 26.8 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change (ΔH) for the reaction between ammonium nitrate and water is 26.8 kJ/mol."
