    "message_2": "The energy released in the nuclear fission of uranium-235 can be calculated using the energy-mass equivalence formula, E=mc^2, where E is the energy, m is the mass, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the energy released per fission event. For uranium-235, the energy released per fission event is approximately 200 MeV (million electron volts). To convert this to joules, we can use the conversion factor 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^(-19) J. \n\n200 MeV = 200 x 10^6 eV = 200 x 10^6 x 1.602 x 10^(-19) J ≈ 3.204 x 10^(-11) J per fission event.\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of uranium-235 atoms in 1 gram. The atomic mass of uranium-235 is approximately 235 g/mol. Using Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol), we can calculate the number of atoms in 1 gram:\n\n(1 g) / (235 g/mol) x (6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol) ≈ 2.56 x 10^21 atoms.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total energy released by multiplying the energy per fission event by the number of uranium-235 atoms in 1 gram:\n\n(3.204 x 10^(-11) J/fission) x (2.56 x 10^21 atoms) ≈ 8.16 x 10^10 J.\n\nTherefore, the energy released in the nuclear fission of 1 gram of uranium-235 is approximately 8.16 x 10^10 joules."
