    "message_2": "In carbon dioxide (CO2), the molecule has a linear structure with carbon in the center and oxygen atoms on both sides. The carbon-oxygen bond is polar due to the difference in electronegativity between carbon (2.55) and oxygen (3.44). Oxygen is more electronegative than carbon, so it attracts the shared electrons more strongly, creating a partial negative charge (δ-) on the oxygen atoms and a partial positive charge (δ+) on the carbon atom.\n\nHowever, due to the linear and symmetrical structure of CO2, the two polar carbon-oxygen bonds are oriented in opposite directions, and their dipole moments cancel each other out. As a result, the overall molecule is nonpolar, even though the individual carbon-oxygen bonds are polar."
