    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction, we need to determine the energy required to break the bonds in the reactants and the energy released when new bonds are formed in the products.\n\nFor the reactants:\n2 moles of H-H bonds need to be broken: 2 * 436 kJ/mol = 872 kJ\n1 mole of O=O bond needs to be broken: 1 * 498 kJ/mol = 498 kJ\nTotal energy required to break bonds in reactants: 872 kJ + 498 kJ = 1370 kJ\n\nFor the products:\n4 moles of H-O bonds are formed: 4 * 463 kJ/mol = 1852 kJ\nTotal energy released when new bonds are formed in products: 1852 kJ\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction:\nEnthalpy change = Energy released in products - Energy required for reactants\nEnthalpy change = 1852 kJ - 1370 kJ = 482 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change for the reaction is 482 kJ."
