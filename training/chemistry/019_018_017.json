    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the phase transition reaction of solid carbon dioxide (dry ice) at -78.5°C to gaseous carbon dioxide at 1 atm and 25°C, we need to consider the following steps:\n\n1. Heating solid CO2 from -78.5°C to its sublimation point (-56.6°C)\n2. Sublimation of solid CO2 to gaseous CO2\n3. Heating gaseous CO2 from -56.6°C to 25°C\n\nStep 1: Heating solid CO2 from -78.5°C to its sublimation point (-56.6°C)\nTo calculate the enthalpy change for this step, we need the heat capacity of solid CO2. The heat capacity of solid CO2 is approximately 37.135 J/mol·K.\n\nΔH1 = heat capacity × ΔT\nΔH1 = 37.135 J/mol·K × ( -56.6°C - (-78.5°C))\nΔH1 = 37.135 J/mol·K × 21.9 K\nΔH1 = 812.56 J/mol\nΔH1 = 0.81256 kJ/mol\n\nStep 2: Sublimation of solid CO2 to gaseous CO2\nThe standard enthalpy of sublimation is equal to the sum of the standard enthalpy of fusion and the standard enthalpy of vaporization.\n\nΔH_sublimation = ΔH_fusion + ΔH_vaporization\nΔH_sublimation = 8.4 kJ/mol + 22.1 kJ/mol\nΔH_sublimation = 30.5 kJ/mol\n\nStep 3: Heating gaseous CO2 from -56.6°C to 25°C\nTo calculate the enthalpy change for this step, we need the heat capacity of gaseous CO2. The heat capacity of gaseous CO2 is approximately 36.94 J/mol·K.\n\nΔH3 = heat capacity × ΔT\nΔH3 = 36.94 J/mol·K × (25°C - (-56.6°C))\nΔH3 = 36.94 J/mol·K × 81.6 K\nΔH3 = 3015.024 J/mol\nΔH3 = 3.015024 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the total standard enthalpy change for the phase transition:\n\nΔH_total = ΔH1 + ΔH_sublimation + ΔH3\nΔH_total = 0.81256 kJ/mol + 30.5 kJ/mol + 3.015024 kJ/mol\nΔH_total = 34.327584 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the phase transition reaction of solid carbon dioxide (dry ice) at -78.5°C to gaseous carbon dioxide at 1 atm and 25°C is approximately 34.33 kJ/mol."
