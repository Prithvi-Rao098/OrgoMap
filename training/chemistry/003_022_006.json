    "message_2": "The effect of temperature on the solubility of solid solutes in aqueous solutions is generally positive, meaning that solubility increases with increasing temperature. However, this is not always the case, as some solutes exhibit a negative temperature dependence, where solubility decreases with increasing temperature.\n\nA common example of a solid solute with a positive temperature dependence is potassium nitrate (KNO₃). The solubility of potassium nitrate in water increases as the temperature of the solution increases. Here is some experimental data showing the solubility of potassium nitrate in water at various temperatures:\n\nTemperature (°C) | Solubility (g KNO₃/100 g H₂O)\n-----------------|-----------------------------\n0                | 13.3\n20               | 31.6\n40               | 64.7\n60               | 106.0\n80               | 167.0\n100              | 246.0\n\nAs seen in the data, the solubility of potassium nitrate in water increases significantly with increasing temperature. This can be explained by the fact that the dissolution of potassium nitrate in water is an endothermic process, meaning it absorbs heat from the surroundings. As the temperature increases, more heat is available to overcome the lattice energy of the solid, allowing more solute particles to dissolve in the solvent.\n\nIn contrast, some solutes, like calcium sulfate (CaSO₄), exhibit a negative temperature dependence, where solubility decreases with increasing temperature. This occurs when the dissolution process is exothermic, meaning it releases heat. In such cases, increasing the temperature reduces the driving force for dissolution, leading to a decrease in solubility.\n\nIn summary, the effect of temperature on the solubility of solid solutes in aqueous solutions depends on the specific solute and the nature of the dissolution process. Generally, solubility increases with increasing temperature for endothermic processes, while it decreases for exothermic processes."
