    "message_1": "What is the surface area of a sample of activated carbon if 10 mL of nitrogen gas is adsorbed by the sample at 0°C and 1 atm pressure, and the BET constant k is 0.25mL/m²?",
    "message_2": "The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) equation is used to determine the surface area of a porous material like activated carbon. The equation is:\n\nV = (V_m * C * P) / [(1 - P) * (1 + (C - 1) * P)]\n\nwhere:\nV = volume of adsorbed gas (in this case, nitrogen) at a given pressure P\nV_m = volume of gas required to form a monolayer on the surface\nC = BET constant (k in the problem)\nP = relative pressure (P/P0)\n\nSince the nitrogen gas is adsorbed at 1 atm pressure (P0), the relative pressure P is 1.\n\nGiven:\nV = 10 mL\nk = 0.25 mL/m²\nP = 1\n\nWe can rearrange the BET equation to solve for V_m:\n\nV_m = V * [(1 - P) * (1 + (C - 1) * P)] / (C * P)\n\nV_m = 10 * [(1 - 1) * (1 + (0.25 - 1) * 1)] / (0.25 * 1)\n\nV_m = 10 * [0 * (1 - 0.75)] / 0.25\n\nSince (1 - P) = 0, the equation simplifies to:\n\nV_m = 0\n\nThis result indicates that there is an error in the given data or the conditions provided. It is not possible to have a monolayer volume of 0 mL. Please check the given data and conditions and try again."
