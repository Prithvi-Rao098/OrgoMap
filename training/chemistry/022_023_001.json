    "message_2": "To find the pH of a 0.1M solution of formic acid (HCOOH) with a pKa value of 3.75 at 25°C, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log ([A-]/[HA])\n\nwhere pH is the pH of the solution, pKa is the acid dissociation constant, [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base (formate ion, HCOO-), and [HA] is the concentration of the undissociated acid (formic acid, HCOOH).\n\nSince formic acid is a weak acid, it will not dissociate completely in water. We can set up an equilibrium expression for the dissociation of formic acid:\n\nHCOOH (aq) ↔ H+ (aq) + HCOO- (aq)\n\nLet x be the concentration of H+ and HCOO- at equilibrium. Then, the equilibrium concentrations of the species are:\n\n[HCOOH] = 0.1 - x\n[H+] = x\n[HCOO-] = x\n\nNow, we can write the expression for the acid dissociation constant, Ka:\n\nKa = [H+][HCOO-] / [HCOOH]\n\nSince pKa = -log(Ka), we can find the value of Ka:\n\nKa = 10^(-pKa) = 10^(-3.75) ≈ 1.78 x 10^(-4)\n\nSubstituting the equilibrium concentrations into the Ka expression:\n\n1.78 x 10^(-4) = (x)(x) / (0.1 - x)\n\nAssuming that x is much smaller than 0.1, we can simplify the equation:\n\n1.78 x 10^(-4) ≈ x^2 / 0.1\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx^2 ≈ 1.78 x 10^(-5)\nx ≈ 4.22 x 10^(-3)\n\nSince x represents the concentration of H+ ions, we can now calculate the pH:\n\npH = -log([H+]) = -log(4.22 x 10^(-3)) ≈ 2.37\n\nTherefore, the pH of a 0.1M solution of formic acid (HCOOH) with a pKa value of 3.75 at 25°C is approximately 2.37."
