    "message_2": "When 2-methylcyclopentanol undergoes an E1 mechanism with concentrated H2SO4 at high temperature, the major product formed is 1-methylcyclopentene.\n\nHere is the complete reaction mechanism:\n\n1. Protonation of the alcohol: The hydroxyl group (-OH) of 2-methylcyclopentanol reacts with the strong acid H2SO4, resulting in the protonation of the oxygen atom. This forms a good leaving group, water (H2O).\n\n2-methylcyclopentanol + H2SO4 → [2-methylcyclopentyl]-OH2(+) + HSO4(-)\n\n2. Formation of a carbocation: The protonated 2-methylcyclopentanol loses a water molecule, forming a carbocation intermediate. The positive charge is located at the carbon atom where the hydroxyl group was attached.\n\n[2-methylcyclopentyl]-OH2(+) → [2-methylcyclopentyl](+) + H2O\n\n3. Rearrangement (if necessary): In this case, no rearrangement is needed because the carbocation formed is already a secondary carbocation, which is relatively stable.\n\n4. Elimination of a proton: A base (HSO4(-)) abstracts a proton from an adjacent carbon atom, forming a double bond between the carbocation carbon and the adjacent carbon. This results in the formation of the alkene product, 1-methylcyclopentene.\n\n[2-methylcyclopentyl](+) + HSO4(-) → 1-methylcyclopentene + H2SO4\n\nOverall reaction:\n\n2-methylcyclopentanol + H2SO4 → 1-methylcyclopentene + H2O + H2SO4\n\nThe major product is 1-methylcyclopentene."
