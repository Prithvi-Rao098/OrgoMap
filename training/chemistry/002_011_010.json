    "message_2": "IF5, or iodine pentafluoride, is a molecule with iodine (I) as the central atom and five fluorine (F) atoms surrounding it. To determine the molecular geometry, we first need to consider the number of electron domains around the central atom.\n\nIodine has 7 valence electrons, and each fluorine atom contributes 1 electron, making a total of 12 electrons around the central iodine atom. These 12 electrons form 5 bonding pairs with the fluorine atoms and 1 lone pair on the iodine atom. Therefore, there are 6 electron domains around the central iodine atom.\n\nAccording to the VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) theory, the electron domains will arrange themselves to minimize repulsion. In the case of IF5, the molecular geometry is square pyramidal. The five fluorine atoms are positioned at the corners of a square base with the iodine atom in the center, and one fluorine atom is positioned above the square plane, forming the apex of the pyramid. The lone pair of electrons on the iodine atom occupies the space opposite the apex fluorine atom.\n\nNow, let's determine the polarity of IF5. Polarity arises from the difference in electronegativity between the atoms in a molecule. Fluorine is highly electronegative (3.98), while iodine has a lower electronegativity (2.66). This electronegativity difference creates polar bonds between the iodine and fluorine atoms.\n\nIn a square pyramidal geometry, the bond dipoles do not cancel each other out, resulting in a net molecular dipole moment. Therefore, IF5 is a polar molecule."
