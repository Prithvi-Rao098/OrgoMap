    "message_1": "What is the exact amount of nitric acid required to prepare 5 grams of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid from benzoic acid if we assume a yield of 85% for the reaction?",
    "message_2": "To determine the exact amount of nitric acid required, we first need to calculate the amount of benzoic acid needed for the reaction, considering the 85% yield.\n\n1. Calculate the moles of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid needed:\nMolecular weight of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid = 212 g/mol\n5 g of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid / 212 g/mol = 0.0236 moles\n\n2. Calculate the moles of benzoic acid needed, considering the 85% yield:\n0.0236 moles / 0.85 = 0.0278 moles of benzoic acid\n\n3. Calculate the moles of nitric acid needed:\nThe reaction requires 2 moles of nitric acid for each mole of benzoic acid.\n0.0278 moles of benzoic acid * 2 = 0.0556 moles of nitric acid\n\n4. Calculate the mass of nitric acid needed:\nMolecular weight of nitric acid = 63 g/mol\n0.0556 moles * 63 g/mol = 3.5028 g of nitric acid\n\nSo, the exact amount of nitric acid required to prepare 5 grams of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid from benzoic acid, assuming a yield of 85%, is approximately 3.5 grams."
