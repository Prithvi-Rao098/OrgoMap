    "message_2": "First, we need to determine the number of moles of HCl and NaOH in the solution.\n\nmoles of HCl = volume (L) × concentration (M)\nmoles of HCl = 0.025 L × 0.50 mol/L = 0.0125 mol\n\nmoles of NaOH = volume (L) × concentration (M)\nmoles of NaOH = 0.025 L × 0.50 mol/L = 0.0125 mol\n\nSince the moles of HCl and NaOH are equal, the reaction goes to completion and all the HCl and NaOH react to form water and NaCl.\n\nThe heat of reaction (ΔH) is given as -57.1 kJ/mol. The negative sign indicates that the reaction is exothermic (releases heat). To find the heat released during the reaction, we can multiply the moles of the limiting reactant (in this case, both HCl and NaOH have the same moles) by the heat of reaction.\n\nq = moles × ΔH\nq = 0.0125 mol × -57.1 kJ/mol = -0.714 kJ\n\nNow, we need to find the mass of the resulting solution. Since the density is 1.00 g/mL, we can multiply the total volume by the density.\n\nmass = volume × density\nmass = 50.0 mL × 1.00 g/mL = 50.0 g\n\nNext, we can calculate the change in temperature (ΔT) using the heat capacity (Cp) of the solution and the heat released (q).\n\nq = mass × Cp × ΔT\nΔT = q / (mass × Cp)\nΔT = -0.714 kJ / (50.0 g × 4.18 J/g°C)\nΔT = -0.714 × 10^3 J / (50.0 × 4.18)\nΔT ≈ -3.42 °C\n\nSince the initial temperature was 25 °C, the final temperature of the solution after mixing is:\n\nT_final = T_initial + ΔT\nT_final = 25 °C - 3.42 °C ≈ 21.58 °C\n\nThe heat of mixing when 25.0 mL of 0.50 M HCl solution is added to 25.0 mL of 0.50 M NaOH solution at 25 °C is -0.714 kJ, and the final temperature of the solution is approximately 21.58 °C."
