    "message_2": "To calculate the heat energy required to melt 25 grams of ice at 0°C, we need to use the formula:\n\nq = n × ΔHf\n\nwhere q is the heat energy, n is the number of moles of ice, and ΔHf is the enthalpy of fusion of ice.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of ice. The molar mass of water (H₂O) is 18.015 g/mol. To find the number of moles, we can use the formula:\n\nn = mass / molar mass\n\nn = 25 g / 18.015 g/mol\nn ≈ 1.387 moles\n\nNow, we can use the formula for heat energy:\n\nq = n × ΔHf\nq = 1.387 moles × 6.01 kJ/mol\nq ≈ 8.34 kJ\n\nTherefore, the amount of heat energy required to melt 25 grams of ice at 0°C is approximately 8.34 kJ."
