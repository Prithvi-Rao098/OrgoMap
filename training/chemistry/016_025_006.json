    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of dissolution of sodium chloride, we need to know the heat of dissolution (ΔH) for sodium chloride. The heat of dissolution for sodium chloride is -3.88 kJ/mol.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of sodium chloride (NaCl) in 10 grams:\n\nMolar mass of NaCl = 58.44 g/mol\nNumber of moles = (mass) / (molar mass) = (10 g) / (58.44 g/mol) = 0.171 mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change for dissolving 0.171 mol of NaCl:\n\nΔH = (moles of NaCl) × (heat of dissolution per mole)\nΔH = (0.171 mol) × (-3.88 kJ/mol) = -0.664 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy of dissolution for 10 grams of sodium chloride in 100 mL of water at 25°C is -0.664 kJ."
