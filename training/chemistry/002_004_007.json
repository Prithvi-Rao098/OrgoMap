    "message_2": "To calculate the pH of a 0.1 M solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl), we can use the formula:\n\npH = -log10[H+]\n\nSince HCl completely ionizes in water, the concentration of hydrogen ions [H+] will be equal to the concentration of the HCl solution, which is 0.1 M.\n\npH = -log10(0.1)\npH = -(-1)\npH = 1\n\nThe pH of a 0.1 M solution of hydrochloric acid is 1."
