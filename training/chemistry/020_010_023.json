    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which relates the pH, pKa, and the ratio of the concentrations of the conjugate base (A-) and the weak acid (HA):\n\npH = pKa + log ([A-]/[HA])\n\nFirst, we need to find the pKa of acetic acid. The pKa is the negative logarithm of the ionization constant (Ka):\n\npKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.8 x 10^-5) = 4.74\n\nNow, let's find the initial concentrations of acetic acid (HA) and acetate ion (A-). The initial concentration of acetic acid is given as 0.1 M, and since sodium acetate dissociates completely in water, the initial concentration of acetate ion is 0.05 M.\n\nNext, we will use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the initial pH of the solution:\n\npH_initial = pKa + log ([A-]/[HA]) = 4.74 + log (0.05/0.1) = 4.74 - 0.301 = 4.439\n\nNow, let's find the final concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion after adding 0.05 M of sodium acetate. The acetic acid concentration remains the same (0.1 M), and the acetate ion concentration increases by 0.05 M:\n\n[A-]_final = 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.1 M\n\nNow, we can find the final pH of the solution using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH_final = pKa + log ([A-]_final/[HA]) = 4.74 + log (0.1/0.1) = 4.74 + 0 = 4.74\n\nFinally, we can find the change in the equilibrium concentration by comparing the initial and final pH values:\n\nÎ”pH = pH_final - pH_initial = 4.74 - 4.439 = 0.301\n\nThe change in the equilibrium concentration of the acetic acid solution when 0.05 M of sodium acetate is added to it is a 0.301 increase in pH."
