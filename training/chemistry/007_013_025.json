    "message_2": "Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) commonly used to relieve pain, reduce inflammation, and lower fever. The liver plays a crucial role in the metabolism of ibuprofen, which involves two primary biotransformation pathways: oxidation and glucuronidation.\n\n1. Oxidation: The oxidation of ibuprofen is primarily mediated by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system, particularly CYP2C9 and CYP2C8 isoenzymes. The oxidation process results in the formation of two major metabolites: hydroxyibuprofen (2-OH-ibuprofen) and carboxyibuprofen (1-COOH-ibuprofen). These metabolites are less pharmacologically active than the parent drug and are eventually excreted from the body.\n\n2. Glucuronidation: This is the major metabolic pathway for ibuprofen and involves the conjugation of the drug with glucuronic acid, a process catalyzed by uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes. Glucuronidation produces two primary metabolites: ibuprofen acyl glucuronide (IAG) and hydroxyibuprofen glucuronide. These polar, water-soluble conjugates are more easily excreted from the body through urine.\n\nIn summary, the liver metabolizes ibuprofen primarily through oxidation and glucuronidation pathways, producing several metabolites, including hydroxyibuprofen, carboxyibuprofen, ibuprofen acyl glucuronide, and hydroxyibuprofen glucuronide. These metabolites are less pharmacologically active than the parent drug and are eventually excreted from the body through urine."
