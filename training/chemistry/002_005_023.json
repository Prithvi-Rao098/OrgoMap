    "message_2": "Sodium chloride (NaCl) is an ionic compound. \n\nAn ionic compound is formed when there is a transfer of electrons between a metal and a non-metal, resulting in the formation of positively charged ions (cations) and negatively charged ions (anions). These ions are held together by strong electrostatic forces of attraction, known as ionic bonds.\n\nIn the case of sodium chloride, sodium (Na) is a metal from Group 1 of the periodic table, and chlorine (Cl) is a non-metal from Group 17 (also known as the halogens). Sodium has one electron in its outermost shell, while chlorine has seven electrons in its outermost shell. To achieve a stable electron configuration, sodium loses its one valence electron, forming a positively charged sodium ion (Na+), and chlorine gains one electron, forming a negatively charged chloride ion (Cl-). The electrostatic attraction between the Na+ and Cl- ions forms the ionic bond in NaCl.\n\nIn contrast, covalent compounds are formed when non-metal atoms share electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration, and metallic compounds consist of metal atoms bonded together in a lattice structure with a \"sea\" of delocalized electrons.\n\nThus, sodium chloride (NaCl) is an ionic compound due to the transfer of electrons between the metal sodium and the non-metal chlorine, resulting in the formation of oppositely charged ions that are held together by ionic bonds."
