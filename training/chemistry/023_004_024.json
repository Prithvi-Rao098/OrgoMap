    "message_2": "To determine the theoretical yield of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) from the reaction of salicylic acid and acetic anhydride, we first need the balanced chemical equation:\n\nC7H6O3 (salicylic acid) + C4H6O3 (acetic anhydride) â†’ C9H8O4 (acetylsalicylic acid) + C2H4O2 (acetic acid)\n\nNow, we need to determine the limiting reactant. First, we need the molecular weights of the reactants:\n\nSalicylic acid (C7H6O3): 12.01*7 + 1.01*6 + 16.00*3 = 138.12 g/mol\nAcetic anhydride (C4H6O3): 12.01*4 + 1.01*6 + 16.00*3 = 102.09 g/mol\n\nNext, we convert the given amounts of reactants to moles:\n\n10 g salicylic acid * (1 mol / 138.12 g) = 0.0724 mol salicylic acid\n20 mL acetic anhydride * (1.08 g/mL) * (1 mol / 102.09 g) = 0.212 mol acetic anhydride (assuming a density of 1.08 g/mL for acetic anhydride)\n\nNow, we determine the limiting reactant by comparing the mole ratios:\n\n0.0724 mol salicylic acid / 1 = 0.0724\n0.212 mol acetic anhydride / 1 = 0.212\n\nSince 0.0724 is smaller than 0.212, salicylic acid is the limiting reactant.\n\nFinally, we calculate the theoretical yield of acetylsalicylic acid:\n\n0.0724 mol salicylic acid * (1 mol acetylsalicylic acid / 1 mol salicylic acid) * (180.16 g acetylsalicylic acid / 1 mol) = 13.04 g acetylsalicylic acid\n\nThe theoretical yield of acetylsalicylic acid is 13.04 grams."
