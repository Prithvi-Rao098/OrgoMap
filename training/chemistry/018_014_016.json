    "message_2": "To determine the reaction order, we can use the rate law equation:\n\nrate = k[A]^n\n\nwhere rate is the reaction rate, k is the rate constant, [A] is the concentration of reactant A, and n is the reaction order.\n\nLet's consider the initial reaction rate as rate1 and the concentration of reactant A as [A1]. After doubling the concentration of reactant A, the new rate is rate2 and the new concentration is [A2].\n\nGiven that the concentration of reactant A is doubled ([A2] = 2[A1]) and the rate of the reaction triples (rate2 = 3rate1), we can set up the following equations:\n\nrate1 = k[A1]^n\nrate2 = k[2A1]^n\n\nNow, we can substitute rate2 = 3rate1:\n\n3rate1 = k[2A1]^n\n\nDivide both sides by rate1:\n\n3 = (k[2A1]^n) / (k[A1]^n)\n\nSince k is a constant, it cancels out:\n\n3 = ([2A1]^n) / ([A1]^n)\n\nNow, we need to solve for n:\n\n3 = (2^n)\n\nTaking the logarithm of both sides (using base 2):\n\nlog2(3) = n\n\nn â‰ˆ 1.585\n\nThe reaction order is approximately 1.585. In general, reaction orders are usually integers (0, 1, 2, etc.), but in some cases, they can be non-integers, as in this case."
