    "message_1": "A student wants to synthesize a polymer using the monomer vinyl chloride. The reaction is exothermic and produces a polymer with an average molecular weight of 50,000 g/mol. The enthalpy change of polymerization for this reaction is -121.8 kJ/mol. How much heat is liberated during the polymerization of 1 mol of vinyl chloride?",
    "message_2": "To determine the heat liberated during the polymerization of 1 mol of vinyl chloride, we first need to find out how many moles of vinyl chloride are present in the polymer with an average molecular weight of 50,000 g/mol.\n\nThe molecular weight of vinyl chloride (C2H3Cl) is:\nC: 12.01 g/mol (2 atoms) = 24.02 g/mol\nH: 1.01 g/mol (3 atoms) = 3.03 g/mol\nCl: 35.45 g/mol (1 atom) = 35.45 g/mol\nTotal molecular weight of vinyl chloride = 24.02 + 3.03 + 35.45 = 62.50 g/mol\n\nNow, we can determine the number of moles of vinyl chloride in the polymer:\n50,000 g/mol (polymer) / 62.50 g/mol (vinyl chloride) = 800 moles of vinyl chloride\n\nSince the enthalpy change of polymerization is -121.8 kJ/mol, we can calculate the heat liberated during the polymerization of 1 mol of vinyl chloride:\n\nHeat liberated = Enthalpy change of polymerization * moles of vinyl chloride\nHeat liberated = -121.8 kJ/mol * 800 moles\nHeat liberated = -97,440 kJ\n\nTherefore, the heat liberated during the polymerization of 1 mol of vinyl chloride is -97,440 kJ."
