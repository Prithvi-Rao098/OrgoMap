    "message_2": "To find the mass percentage of magnesium oxide in the sample, we can use the following formula:\n\nMass percentage = (mass of magnesium oxide / mass of magnesium carbonate) × 100\n\nGiven that 1.152 grams of magnesium carbonate produced 0.784 grams of magnesium oxide after heating, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nMass percentage = (0.784 g / 1.152 g) × 100\n\nMass percentage ≈ 0.6806 × 100\n\nMass percentage ≈ 68.06%\n\nTherefore, the mass percentage of magnesium oxide in the sample is approximately 68.06%."
