    "message_2": "Ibuprofen is an arylpropionic acid derivative with the chemical structure 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanoic acid. To synthesize ibuprofen from benzene, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:\nReagents: Isobutyl chloride (CH3)2CHCH2Cl, AlCl3\nReaction: Benzene + (CH3)2CHCH2Cl → 4-isobutylbenzene\n\n2. Friedel-Crafts Acylation:\nReagents: Propionyl chloride (CH3CH2COCl), AlCl3\nReaction: 4-isobutylbenzene + CH3CH2COCl → 4-isobutylacetophenone\n\n3. Reduction of the carbonyl group:\nReagents: NaBH4 or LiAlH4\nReaction: 4-isobutylacetophenone + NaBH4 → 4-isobutyl-1-phenylpropan-1-ol\n\n4. Oxidation of the alcohol to carboxylic acid:\nReagents: Jones reagent (CrO3, H2SO4, H2O) or PCC (Pyridinium chlorochromate)\nReaction: 4-isobutyl-1-phenylpropan-1-ol + Jones reagent → 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanoic acid (Ibuprofen)\n\nIn summary, the synthesis of ibuprofen from benzene involves Friedel-Crafts alkylation with isobutyl chloride, followed by Friedel-Crafts acylation with propionyl chloride, reduction of the carbonyl group with NaBH4 or LiAlH4, and finally oxidation of the alcohol to the carboxylic acid using Jones reagent or PCC."
