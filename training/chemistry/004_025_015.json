    "message_2": "Voltammetry is an electroanalytical technique that can be used to determine the concentration of various metal ions, including lead, in water samples. To determine the concentration of lead in a contaminated water sample using voltammetry, follow these steps:\n\n1. Sample preparation: Collect the water sample from the contaminated source and filter it to remove any suspended particles or debris. This will ensure that the voltammetric analysis is not affected by any interfering substances.\n\n2. Electrode preparation: Clean and polish the working electrode (usually a glassy carbon electrode or a mercury-based electrode) to ensure a reproducible and sensitive response. The counter electrode (typically a platinum wire) and the reference electrode (such as Ag/AgCl) should also be cleaned.\n\n3. Electrolyte solution: Prepare a suitable electrolyte solution, such as a mixture of acetic acid and sodium acetate, to support the electrochemical reactions and maintain a stable pH during the analysis.\n\n4. Calibration: Prepare a series of standard solutions containing known concentrations of lead ions. Perform voltammetric measurements on these standard solutions to establish a calibration curve. This curve will be used to determine the concentration of lead in the unknown water sample.\n\n5. Voltammetric analysis: Add a known volume of the water sample to the electrolyte solution and perform the voltammetric analysis. Depending on the specific voltammetric technique used (e.g., linear sweep voltammetry, differential pulse voltammetry, or square wave voltammetry), apply an appropriate potential to the working electrode and measure the resulting current response.\n\n6. Data analysis: The current response will be proportional to the concentration of lead ions in the water sample. Compare the current response of the unknown sample to the calibration curve established in step 4 to determine the concentration of lead in the water sample.\n\n7. Quality control: To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results, perform replicate measurements on the water sample and analyze a blank (a sample without lead) to account for any background signal.\n\nBy following these steps, voltammetry can be used to accurately and sensitively determine the concentration of lead in a water sample collected from a contaminated source. This information can then be used to assess the severity of the contamination and inform appropriate remediation strategies."
