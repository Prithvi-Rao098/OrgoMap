    "message_2": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a linear molecule with a carbon atom in the center and two oxygen atoms on either side. The carbon-oxygen bonds in CO2 are polar due to the difference in electronegativity between carbon and oxygen atoms. However, the overall dipole moment of the CO2 molecule is zero. This is because the two polar bonds are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, which results in their dipole moments canceling each other out.\n\nSince CO2 has a net dipole moment of zero, it is considered a nonpolar molecule. This nonpolar nature affects its physical properties in several ways:\n\n1. Solubility: CO2 is less soluble in polar solvents like water, as \"like dissolves like.\" Nonpolar molecules tend to dissolve better in nonpolar solvents, which is why CO2 is more soluble in organic solvents.\n\n2. Boiling and melting points: Nonpolar molecules like CO2 generally have lower boiling and melting points compared to polar molecules of similar size and mass. This is because nonpolar molecules have weaker intermolecular forces (van der Waals forces) compared to polar molecules, which have stronger dipole-dipole interactions. CO2 has a relatively low boiling point (-78.5Â°C) and sublimates directly from solid to gas under normal atmospheric pressure.\n\n3. Reactivity: The nonpolar nature of CO2 can affect its reactivity with other molecules. For example, CO2 is less likely to react with nonpolar molecules and more likely to react with polar molecules or charged species.\n\nIn summary, the dipole moment of CO2 is zero due to its linear structure and the cancelation of the two polar carbon-oxygen bonds. This nonpolar nature affects its physical properties, such as solubility, boiling and melting points, and reactivity."
