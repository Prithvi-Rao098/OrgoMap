    "message_2": "The magnetic moment of a molecule is determined by the number of unpaired electrons in its molecular orbitals. In the case of nitric oxide (NO), the ground state electronic configuration is:\n\nN (1s² 2s² 2p³) + O (1s² 2s² 2p⁴) → NO (1σ² 2σ² 1π⁴ 3σ² 2π³)\n\nIn this configuration, there are 3 unpaired electrons in the 2π molecular orbitals. The magnetic moment (μ) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nμ = √(n(n+2)) where n is the number of unpaired electrons\n\nFor NO in its ground state, n = 3, so:\n\nμ = √(3(3+2)) = √15 Bohr magnetons\n\nUpon excitation to its first excited state, one of the unpaired electrons in the 2π orbital will be promoted to a higher energy level, resulting in only 2 unpaired electrons. The magnetic moment in the first excited state will be:\n\nμ = √(2(2+2)) = √8 Bohr magnetons\n\nSo, the magnetic moment of NO in its ground state is √15 Bohr magnetons, and it decreases to √8 Bohr magnetons upon excitation to its first excited state."
