    "message_1": "Calculate the equilibrium constant, Kc, for the reaction below at 25°C, if the concentration of CO2 is 0.10 M, the concentration of H2 is 0.20 M, and the concentration of CO is 0.30 M.\n\nCO2(g) + H2(g) ⇌ CO(g) + H2O(g)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant, Kc, we need to know the concentrations of all species involved in the reaction at equilibrium. However, you only provided the initial concentrations of CO2, H2, and CO. The concentration of H2O is missing, and we don't know if the reaction has reached equilibrium yet.\n\nIf we assume that the reaction has reached equilibrium and you provide the equilibrium concentration of H2O, we can calculate Kc using the formula:\n\nKc = [CO][H2O] / ([CO2][H2])\n\nPlease provide the equilibrium concentration of H2O, and we can proceed with the calculation."
