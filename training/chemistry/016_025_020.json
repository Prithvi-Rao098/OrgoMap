    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the dissolution of NaCl in water, we need to determine the heat absorbed or released by the water during the process. We can do this using the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat absorbed or released, m is the mass of the water, c is the specific heat capacity of water, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nFirst, let's find the change in temperature:\n\nΔT = T_final - T_initial\nΔT = 20°C - 25°C\nΔT = -5°C\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat absorbed or released by the water:\n\nq = mcΔT\nq = (100 g)(4.18 J/(g°C))(-5°C)\nq = -2090 J\n\nSince the heat absorbed by the water is negative, this means that the water released heat during the dissolution process. Therefore, the enthalpy change for the dissolution of NaCl in water is -2090 J.\n\nHowever, this value is for the dissolution of 10g of NaCl. To find the enthalpy change per mole of NaCl, we need to convert the mass of NaCl to moles:\n\nmoles of NaCl = mass / molar mass\nmoles of NaCl = 10 g / 58.44 g/mol\nmoles of NaCl = 0.171 mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change per mole of NaCl:\n\nΔH = q / moles of NaCl\nΔH = -2090 J / 0.171 mol\nΔH = -12222 J/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change for the dissolution of NaCl in water is approximately -12.2 kJ/mol."
