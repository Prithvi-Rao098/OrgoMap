    "message_2": "To calculate the pH of the buffer solution, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n\nwhere pKa is the negative logarithm of the acid dissociation constant (Ka), [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate ion), and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid (acetic acid).\n\nFirst, let's find the pKa:\n\npKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.8 x 10^-5) ≈ 4.74\n\nNext, we need to find the final concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion in the buffer solution. To do this, we can use the formula:\n\nM1V1 = M2V2\n\nFor acetic acid:\n\n(0.10 M)(25 mL) = M2(40 mL)\n\nM2 = (0.10 M)(25 mL) / 40 mL ≈ 0.0625 M\n\nFor sodium acetate:\n\n(0.20 M)(15 mL) = M2(40 mL)\n\nM2 = (0.20 M)(15 mL) / 40 mL ≈ 0.075 M\n\nNow we can plug these values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = 4.74 + log(0.075 / 0.0625) ≈ 4.74 + 0.17 ≈ 4.91\n\nSo, the pH of the buffer solution is approximately 4.91."
