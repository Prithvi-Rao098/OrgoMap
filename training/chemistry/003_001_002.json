    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change of the reaction, we need to find the difference between the bond energies of the reactants and products. \n\nFor the reactants, we have 2 moles of H-H bonds and 1 mole of O=O bond. \nFor the products, we have 4 moles of O-H bonds (since there are 2 moles of H2O, each with 2 O-H bonds).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total bond energy of the reactants:\nReactants bond energy = (2 moles H-H × 432 kJ/mol H-H) + (1 mole O=O × 498 kJ/mol O=O)\nReactants bond energy = (864 kJ) + (498 kJ) = 1362 kJ\n\nNow, let's calculate the total bond energy of the products:\nProducts bond energy = (4 moles O-H × 464 kJ/mol O-H)\nProducts bond energy = 1856 kJ\n\nNow, we can find the standard enthalpy change of the reaction:\nΔH = Products bond energy - Reactants bond energy\nΔH = 1856 kJ - 1362 kJ = 494 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change of the reaction at 298 K is 494 kJ."
