The density of the solution is 1.00 g/mL and the specific heat capacity of the solution is 4.18 J/(g°C). The molar mass of NaOH is 40.00 g/mol.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change (∆H°) for the dissolution of NaOH, we will use the formula:\n\nq = mc∆T\n\nwhere q is the heat absorbed or released, m is the mass of the solution, c is the specific heat capacity, and ∆T is the change in temperature.\n\nFirst, we need to find the mass of the solution. Since the density of the solution is 1.00 g/mL, the mass of 100.0 mL of water is:\n\nmass of water = density × volume = 1.00 g/mL × 100.0 mL = 100.0 g\n\nNow, we add the mass of NaOH to the mass of water to find the total mass of the solution:\n\nmass of solution = mass of water + mass of NaOH = 100.0 g + 5.00 g = 105.0 g\n\nNext, we find the change in temperature:\n\n∆T = final temperature - initial temperature = 27.5°C - 25.0°C = 2.5°C\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat absorbed or released (q) using the formula:\n\nq = mc∆T = (105.0 g)(4.18 J/(g°C))(2.5°C) = 1096.95 J\n\nSince the temperature of the solution increased, the dissolution of NaOH is exothermic, and the heat released (q) will be negative:\n\nq = -1096.95 J\n\nNow, we need to find the moles of NaOH dissolved:\n\nmoles of NaOH = mass of NaOH / molar mass of NaOH = 5.00 g / 40.00 g/mol = 0.125 mol\n\nFinally, we can calculate the standard enthalpy change (∆H°) for the dissolution of NaOH:\n\n∆H° = q / moles of NaOH = -1096.95 J / 0.125 mol = -8775.6 J/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the dissolution of 5.00 g of solid NaOH in 100.0 mL of water is -8775.6 J/mol."
