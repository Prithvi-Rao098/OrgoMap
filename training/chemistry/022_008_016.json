    "message_2": "When solid zinc is added to a solution of hydrochloric acid, the reaction produces zinc chloride and hydrogen gas. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nZn (s) + 2 HCl (aq) → ZnCl₂ (aq) + H₂ (g)\n\nTo calculate the mass of hydrogen gas produced when 5.0 grams of zinc reacts with excess hydrochloric acid, we will use stoichiometry.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the molar mass of zinc (Zn) and hydrogen gas (H₂). The molar mass of Zn is 65.38 g/mol, and the molar mass of H₂ is 2.02 g/mol.\n\nNext, we will convert the mass of zinc to moles:\n\nmoles of Zn = (mass of Zn) / (molar mass of Zn) = (5.0 g) / (65.38 g/mol) = 0.0765 mol\n\nNow, we will use the stoichiometry of the balanced chemical equation to determine the moles of hydrogen gas produced:\n\nmoles of H₂ = moles of Zn * (1 mol H₂ / 1 mol Zn) = 0.0765 mol * (1 mol H₂ / 1 mol Zn) = 0.0765 mol H₂\n\nFinally, we will convert the moles of hydrogen gas to mass:\n\nmass of H₂ = (moles of H₂) * (molar mass of H₂) = (0.0765 mol) * (2.02 g/mol) = 0.15453 g\n\nTherefore, the mass of hydrogen gas produced when 5.0 grams of zinc reacts with excess hydrochloric acid is approximately 0.1545 grams."
