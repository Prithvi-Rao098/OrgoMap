    "message_2": "In one cycle of the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle), a total of 1 ATP (or GTP) is produced through substrate-level phosphorylation. Additionally, the cycle generates 3 NADH and 1 FADH2 molecules, which are used in oxidative phosphorylation to produce ATP.\n\nIn oxidative phosphorylation, each NADH molecule generates approximately 2.5 ATP, and each FADH2 molecule generates approximately 1.5 ATP through the electron transport chain and chemiosmosis.\n\nSo, the net yield of ATP produced in one cycle of the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation can be calculated as follows:\n\n1 ATP (from the citric acid cycle) + (3 NADH × 2.5 ATP) + (1 FADH2 × 1.5 ATP) = 1 + 7.5 + 1.5 = 10 ATP\n\nThus, the net yield of ATP produced in one cycle of the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation is approximately 10 ATP. However, it's important to note that the actual yield may vary slightly depending on the efficiency of the electron transport chain and the specific organism."
