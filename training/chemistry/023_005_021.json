    "message_2": "The synthesis of ibuprofen from 2-methylpropylbenzene (isobutylbenzene) and carbon dioxide involves several steps. Here is a step-by-step mechanism with the reagents and conditions required for each step:\n\n1. Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:\nReagents: 2-methylpropylbenzene (isobutylbenzene), propionyl chloride, aluminum chloride (AlCl3)\nConditions: Anhydrous conditions, room temperature\nMechanism: The AlCl3 acts as a Lewis acid catalyst, activating the propionyl chloride by forming a complex with the carbonyl oxygen. This generates an electrophilic acyl species, which then reacts with the isobutylbenzene at the aromatic ring through an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. The AlCl3 is then regenerated, and the desired 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanoyl chloride is formed.\n\n2. Hydrolysis:\nReagents: Water\nConditions: Heating under reflux\nMechanism: The 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanoyl chloride reacts with water, replacing the chloride group with a hydroxyl group to form 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanoic acid (ibuprofen precursor).\n\n3. Kolbe-Schmitt Reaction (Carboxylation):\nReagents: Carbon dioxide (CO2), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), hydrochloric acid (HCl)\nConditions: High pressure (100-150 atm), high temperature (150-200Â°C)\nMechanism: The ibuprofen precursor is first deprotonated by NaOH to form a carboxylate ion. The carboxylate ion then reacts with CO2 under high pressure and temperature to form a new carboxylate group at the ortho position of the aromatic ring. The product is then protonated by HCl to form the final ibuprofen product, 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionic acid.\n\nThese steps outline the synthesis of ibuprofen from 2-methylpropylbenzene and carbon dioxide. Note that there are other methods to synthesize ibuprofen, but this is one of the most common routes."
