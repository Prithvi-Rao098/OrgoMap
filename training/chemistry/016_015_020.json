    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat absorbed or released during the crystallization of sodium acetate, we can use the following formula:\n\nq = n * ΔH\n\nwhere q is the heat absorbed or released, n is the number of moles, and ΔH is the heat of crystallization.\n\nGiven:\nn = 2.5 moles\nΔH = -427 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nq = (2.5 moles) * (-427 kJ/mol)\n\nq = -1067.5 kJ\n\nSince the value of q is negative, it indicates that heat is released during the crystallization process. Therefore, 1067.5 kJ of heat is released when 2.5 moles of sodium acetate crystallize from its solution at 25°C."
