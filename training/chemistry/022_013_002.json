    "message_2": "In H2SO4, the oxidation state of sulfur is +6. \n\nHere's the breakdown of the oxidation states for each element in the compound:\n- Hydrogen (H) has an oxidation state of +1.\n- Oxygen (O) has an oxidation state of -2.\n\nSince there are two hydrogen atoms and four oxygen atoms, the total oxidation states for hydrogen and oxygen are +2 and -8, respectively. To balance the overall charge of the compound, the oxidation state of sulfur (S) must be +6."
