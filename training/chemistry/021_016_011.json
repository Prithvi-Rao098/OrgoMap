    "message_2": "On the Pauling scale of electronegativity, carbon has an electronegativity value of 2.55, and hydrogen has a value of 2.20. To calculate the electronegativity difference between carbon and hydrogen in a methane (CH4) molecule, subtract the electronegativity value of hydrogen from that of carbon:\n\nElectronegativity difference = Electronegativity of carbon - Electronegativity of hydrogen\nElectronegativity difference = 2.55 - 2.20\nElectronegativity difference = 0.35\n\nThe electronegativity difference between carbon and hydrogen in a methane molecule is 0.35 on the Pauling scale."
