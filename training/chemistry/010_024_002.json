    "message_2": "The exchange current density (i0) is a measure of the rate of an electrochemical reaction and can be calculated using the following formula:\n\ni0 = k0 * n * F * C * A\n\nwhere:\n- i0 is the exchange current density (A/cm²)\n- k0 is the electrochemical rate constant (cm/s)\n- n is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction (for the oxidation of copper, Cu -> Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻, n = 2)\n- F is the Faraday constant (96485 C/mol)\n- C is the concentration of the reactant (1 M for CuSO₄ solution)\n- A is the surface area of the electrode (0.05 cm²)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the exchange current density:\n\ni0 = (5.2 × 10^-3 cm/s) * 2 * (96485 C/mol) * (1 mol/L) * (0.05 cm²)\n\ni0 = 0.0104 * 96485 * 0.05\n\ni0 = 50.3444 A/cm²\n\nThe exchange current density for the oxidation reaction of copper in a 1 M CuSO₄ solution is approximately 50.34 A/cm²."
