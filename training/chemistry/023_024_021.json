Include the necessary reagents and the mechanism of the reaction. Additionally, calculate the theoretical yield of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene if 10 grams of nitrobenzene is reacted with excess chlorine gas.",
    "message_2": "To prepare 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene from nitrobenzene and chlorine gas, you need to carry out an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. The reaction conditions and steps are as follows:\n\n1. Reagents and conditions:\n   - Nitrobenzene (starting material)\n   - Chlorine gas (Cl2, electrophile)\n   - Ferric chloride (FeCl3, catalyst)\n   - Temperature: 0-5°C (to minimize side reactions and over-chlorination)\n\n2. Mechanism:\n   a. Generation of the electrophile: Chlorine gas reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (FeCl3) to form the electrophile, Cl+.\n      Cl2 + FeCl3 → 2Cl+ + FeCl4-\n\n   b. Electrophilic attack: The Cl+ electrophile attacks the nitrobenzene at the ortho and para positions, forming a resonance-stabilized carbocation intermediate.\n\n   c. Deprotonation: A base (such as Cl-) deprotonates the carbocation intermediate, restoring the aromaticity of the ring and forming 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene.\n\n3. Theoretical yield calculation:\n   First, determine the molar mass of nitrobenzene and 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene:\n   - Nitrobenzene (C6H5NO2): 123.11 g/mol\n   - 2,4-Dichloronitrobenzene (C6H3Cl2NO2): 202.01 g/mol\n\n   Next, calculate the moles of nitrobenzene used:\n   Moles of nitrobenzene = 10 g / 123.11 g/mol = 0.0812 mol\n\n   Since the reaction has a 1:1 stoichiometry, the moles of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene produced will be the same as the moles of nitrobenzene used (assuming 100% yield).\n\n   Moles of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene = 0.0812 mol\n\n   Finally, calculate the theoretical yield of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene:\n   Theoretical yield = 0.0812 mol * 202.01 g/mol = 16.39 g\n\nThe theoretical yield of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene when 10 grams of nitrobenzene is reacted with excess chlorine gas is 16.39 grams."
