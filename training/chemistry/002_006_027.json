    "message_2": "To calculate the molar mass of magnesium chloride (MgCl2), we need to find the molar mass of each element in the compound and then add them together.\n\n1. Find the molar mass of magnesium (Mg):\nThe molar mass of magnesium is 24.305 g/mol (found on the periodic table).\n\n2. Find the molar mass of chlorine (Cl):\nThe molar mass of chlorine is 35.453 g/mol (found on the periodic table).\n\n3. Calculate the molar mass of magnesium chloride (MgCl2):\nSince there is one magnesium atom and two chlorine atoms in the compound, we need to multiply the molar mass of chlorine by 2 and then add it to the molar mass of magnesium.\n\nMolar mass of MgCl2 = (molar mass of Mg) + 2 * (molar mass of Cl)\nMolar mass of MgCl2 = 24.305 g/mol + 2 * 35.453 g/mol\nMolar mass of MgCl2 = 24.305 g/mol + 70.906 g/mol\nMolar mass of MgCl2 = 95.211 g/mol\n\nSo, the molar mass of magnesium chloride (MgCl2) is 95.211 g/mol."
