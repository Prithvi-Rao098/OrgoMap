    "message_1": "What is the new value of the equilibrium constant, Kc, for the following reaction when the temperature is increased from 300 K to 400 K?\n\n2NO2(g) ⇌ 2NO(g) + O2(g)\n\nThe initial equilibrium constant at 300 K is 4.0 x 10^-3. The enthalpy change for the reaction is -59.2 kJ/mol and the entropy change is -176.8 J/mol*K.",
    "message_2": "To find the new value of the equilibrium constant, Kc, at the increased temperature of 400 K, we can use the Van't Hoff equation:\n\nln(K2/K1) = -ΔH°/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere K1 and K2 are the equilibrium constants at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively, ΔH° is the enthalpy change, and R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol*K).\n\nWe are given the following information:\n\nK1 = 4.0 x 10^-3 (at T1 = 300 K)\nT2 = 400 K\nΔH° = -59.2 kJ/mol = -59200 J/mol\nΔS° = -176.8 J/mol*K\n\nFirst, we need to find the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) at 300 K using the equation:\n\nΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°\n\nΔG°(300 K) = -59200 J/mol - (300 K * -176.8 J/mol*K)\nΔG°(300 K) = -59200 J/mol + 53040 J/mol\nΔG°(300 K) = -6160 J/mol\n\nNow, we can use the relationship between ΔG° and K:\n\nΔG° = -RT ln(K)\n\n-6160 J/mol = -(8.314 J/mol*K)(300 K) ln(4.0 x 10^-3)\nln(4.0 x 10^-3) = 2.76\n\nNow, we can use the Van't Hoff equation to find ln(K2):\n\nln(K2/4.0 x 10^-3) = (-(-59200 J/mol))/(8.314 J/mol*K) * (1/400 K - 1/300 K)\nln(K2/4.0 x 10^-3) = 1.38\n\nNow, we can solve for K2:\n\nln(K2) = ln(4.0 x 10^-3) + 1.38\nln(K2) = 2.76 + 1.38\nln(K2) = 4.14\n\nK2 = e^4.14\nK2 ≈ 62.9\n\nSo, the new value of the equilibrium constant, Kc, at 400 K is approximately 62.9."
