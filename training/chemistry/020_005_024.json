    "message_1": "What is the effect of adding more ammonia gas to an equilibrium mixture of nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas, when the mixture is warmed to 450°C at a pressure of 4 atm? Will it shift the equilibrium towards products or reactants and what will be the new equilibrium constant (Kp) for the reaction if the initial Kp is 3.0 x 10^-2?",
    "message_2": "The reaction between nitrogen gas (N2) and hydrogen gas (H2) to form ammonia gas (NH3) is given by the following equation:\n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g)\n\nThis reaction is an example of a reversible reaction, meaning it can proceed in both the forward and reverse directions. The position of the equilibrium can be shifted by changing the conditions, such as temperature, pressure, or concentration of the reactants and products.\n\nWhen more ammonia gas is added to the equilibrium mixture, the concentration of ammonia increases. According to Le Chatelier's principle, the system will try to counteract this change by shifting the equilibrium position to reduce the concentration of ammonia. In this case, the equilibrium will shift towards the reactants (N2 and H2) to consume some of the added ammonia.\n\nHowever, the equilibrium constant (Kp) is only affected by temperature changes, not by changes in concentration or pressure. Since the temperature remains constant at 450°C, the new equilibrium constant (Kp) will still be 3.0 x 10^-2, even though the equilibrium position has shifted towards the reactants."
