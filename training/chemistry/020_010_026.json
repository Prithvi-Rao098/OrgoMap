    "message_1": "What is the new equilibrium concentration of the products and reactants when 0.1 mol of a common ion is added to a 1.0 L solution of 0.2 M acetic acid (CH3COOH) and 0.3 M sodium acetate (CH3COONa) at equilibrium? The reaction equation is CH3COOH(aq) + H2O(l) ⇆ CH3COO-(aq) + H3O+(aq). The Ka of acetic acid is 1.8 x 10^-5.",
    "message_2": "To find the new equilibrium concentrations, we can use the reaction quotient (Q) and the equilibrium constant (Ka) for the reaction. The reaction quotient is given by:\n\nQ = [CH3COO-][H3O+]/[CH3COOH]\n\nInitially, we have 0.2 M CH3COOH and 0.3 M CH3COO-. When 0.1 mol of a common ion (CH3COO-) is added to the 1.0 L solution, the concentration of CH3COO- increases by 0.1 M, making it 0.4 M. The concentration of CH3COOH remains the same at 0.2 M.\n\nNow, let's assume that x moles of CH3COOH dissociate at equilibrium. The new equilibrium concentrations will be:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.2 - x\n[CH3COO-] = 0.4 + x\n[H3O+] = x\n\nWe can now plug these values into the reaction quotient expression and set it equal to the Ka value:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 = (0.4 + x)(x)/(0.2 - x)\n\nSince Ka is very small, we can assume that x is also very small compared to 0.2 and 0.4. Therefore, we can approximate:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 ≈ (0.4)(x)/(0.2)\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx ≈ (1.8 x 10^-5)(0.2)/0.4\nx ≈ 9 x 10^-6\n\nNow we can find the new equilibrium concentrations:\n\n[CH3COOH] ≈ 0.2 - 9 x 10^-6 ≈ 0.2 M\n[CH3COO-] ≈ 0.4 + 9 x 10^-6 ≈ 0.4 M\n[H3O+] ≈ 9 x 10^-6 M\n\nSo, the new equilibrium concentrations are approximately 0.2 M for CH3COOH, 0.4 M for CH3COO-, and 9 x 10^-6 M for H3O+."
