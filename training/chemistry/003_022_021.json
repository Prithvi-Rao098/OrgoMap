The molar mass of KCl is 74.55 g/mol and the Henry's law constant for KCl in water at 25°C is 4.68×10⁻² mol/L•mmHg.",
    "message_2": "To find the solubility of potassium chloride (KCl) in water at 25°C, we can use Henry's law. Henry's law states that the concentration of a solute in a solution is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the solute above the solution. The formula for Henry's law is:\n\nC = P / K\n\nwhere C is the concentration of the solute (KCl) in the solution (in mol/L), P is the partial pressure of the solute (KCl) above the solution (in mmHg), and K is the Henry's law constant for the solute (KCl) in the solvent (water) at the given temperature (in mol/L•mmHg).\n\nFirst, we need to find the partial pressure of KCl above the solution. Since the vapor pressure of water at 25°C is 23.8 mmHg and the partial pressure of water in the closed container is 21.3 mmHg, the partial pressure of KCl can be calculated as:\n\nP_KCl = P_total - P_water = 23.8 mmHg - 21.3 mmHg = 2.5 mmHg\n\nNow we can use Henry's law to find the concentration of KCl in the solution:\n\nC_KCl = P_KCl / K = 2.5 mmHg / 4.68×10⁻² mol/L•mmHg = 53.42 mol/L\n\nFinally, we can convert the concentration of KCl in mol/L to g/L using the molar mass of KCl (74.55 g/mol):\n\nSolubility_KCl = C_KCl × Molar_mass_KCl = 53.42 mol/L × 74.55 g/mol = 3983.87 g/L\n\nTherefore, the solubility of potassium chloride (KCl) in water at 25°C is approximately 3983.87 g/L."
