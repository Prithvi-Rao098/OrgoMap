    "message_2": "To determine the percentage of copper (Cu) present in a sample of brass alloy (Cu-Zn) using gravimetric analysis, you will need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Obtain a representative sample of the brass alloy.\n2. Weigh the initial mass of the sample (m1).\n3. Dissolve the sample in a suitable solvent, such as nitric acid (HNO3), to dissolve both copper and zinc.\n4. Filter the solution to remove any insoluble impurities.\n5. Precipitate the copper ions by adding a suitable reagent, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or sodium carbonate (Na2CO3). This will form a precipitate of copper hydroxide (Cu(OH)2) or copper carbonate (CuCO3), respectively.\n6. Filter the precipitate and wash it thoroughly to remove any remaining zinc ions or other impurities.\n7. Dry the precipitate and weigh its mass (m2).\n8. Calculate the percentage of copper in the brass alloy using the formula:\n\nPercentage of Cu = (m2 / m1) Ã— 100\n\nKeep in mind that this is a simplified version of the procedure, and actual laboratory conditions may require additional steps or precautions. The accuracy of the result will depend on the quality of the sample, the precision of the measurements, and the efficiency of the precipitation and filtration processes."
