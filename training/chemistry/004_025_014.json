    "message_2": "To determine the concentration of copper ions in a water sample using the square wave voltammetry (SWV) method, you will need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Collect a water sample from the river.\n2. Prepare the sample for analysis by filtering it to remove any suspended particles and adjusting the pH if necessary.\n3. Set up the square wave voltammetry instrument, including the working electrode (usually a glassy carbon electrode), reference electrode (such as Ag/AgCl), and counter electrode (typically a platinum wire).\n4. Perform a calibration by analyzing a series of standard solutions containing known concentrations of copper ions. Record the peak current for each standard solution.\n5. Create a calibration curve by plotting the peak current against the concentration of copper ions in the standard solutions. The relationship between the peak current and concentration should be linear.\n6. Analyze the water sample using the same SWV settings as for the calibration standards. Record the peak current for the sample.\n7. Use the calibration curve to determine the concentration of copper ions in the water sample based on the peak current obtained in step 6.\n\nKeep in mind that the actual concentration of copper ions in the water sample will depend on the specific river and sample collected. The square wave voltammetry method provides a sensitive and accurate way to measure trace levels of metal ions in water samples, but the results will vary depending on the sample and environmental conditions."
