    "message_2": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a linear molecule with a carbon atom double-bonded to two oxygen atoms (O=C=O). The bond between carbon and oxygen is a polar covalent bond, specifically a double bond, which consists of one sigma (σ) bond and one pi (π) bond.\n\nThe bond strength of a molecule can be estimated by considering the bond dissociation energy (BDE), which is the energy required to break a bond homolytically. The BDE values for carbon-oxygen single (C-O) and double (C=O) bonds are approximately 358 kJ/mol and 745 kJ/mol, respectively. Since CO2 has two C=O double bonds, its bond strength is relatively high.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that predicting the exact bond strength of a molecule requires more advanced computational methods and experimental data. The given values are approximate and can vary depending on the specific molecular environment and other factors."
