    "message_2": "To calculate the pH of a 0.1 M solution of HCl, we can use the formula:\n\npH = -log10[H+]\n\nSince HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely in water, meaning that the concentration of H+ ions in the solution is equal to the concentration of HCl. In this case, the concentration of H+ ions is 0.1 M.\n\nNow, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\npH = -log10(0.1)\n\npH = -(-1)\n\npH = 1\n\nSo, the pH of a 0.1 M solution of HCl is 1."
