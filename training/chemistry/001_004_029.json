    "message_2": "The compound C6H5CHO is benzaldehyde. The functional group present in benzaldehyde is an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\nWhen benzaldehyde is treated with HCN (hydrogen cyanide), it undergoes a nucleophilic addition reaction called the cyanohydrin formation. In this reaction, the cyanide ion (CN-) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde group, resulting in the formation of a cyanohydrin. The product formed is called phenylglycolonitrile (C6H5CH(OH)CN)."
