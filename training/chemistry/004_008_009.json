    "message_1": "What functional groups are present in an unknown compound X based on its infrared spectrum?",
    "message_2": "To determine the functional groups present in an unknown compound X based on its infrared (IR) spectrum, I would need to see the actual spectrum or have the significant peak values provided. However, I can give you a general idea of what to look for in an IR spectrum to identify common functional groups.\n\n1. O-H stretch: A broad peak around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of an alcohol (O-H) or carboxylic acid (O-H) group.\n\n2. N-H stretch: A sharp peak around 3300-3500 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of an amine (N-H) or amide (N-H) group.\n\n3. C-H stretch: Peaks around 2800-3000 cm⁻¹ indicate the presence of alkane (C-H) groups, while peaks around 3000-3100 cm⁻¹ indicate the presence of alkene (C-H) or aromatic (C-H) groups.\n\n4. C=O stretch: A strong, sharp peak around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), which can be found in aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, or amides.\n\n5. C=C stretch: A peak around 1600-1680 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of an alkene (C=C) or aromatic (C=C) group.\n\n6. C-N stretch: A peak around 1100-1250 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of an amine (C-N) or amide (C-N) group.\n\n7. C-O stretch: A peak around 1000-1300 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of an ether (C-O), ester (C-O), or alcohol (C-O) group.\n\nPlease provide the specific peak values or the actual IR spectrum of the unknown compound X for a more accurate analysis of the functional groups present."
