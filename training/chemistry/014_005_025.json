    "message_2": "The coordination geometry of the complex [CoCl₂(NH₃)₄]⁺ is octahedral. In this complex, the central cobalt ion (Co) is surrounded by four ammonia (NH₃) ligands and two chloride (Cl) ligands, making a total of six ligands in an octahedral arrangement. The UV-Vis spectra of octahedral complexes typically show d-d transition bands, which can be used to confirm the geometry."
