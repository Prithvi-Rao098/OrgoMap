    "message_2": "The Lewis structure of sulfur dioxide (SO2) can be drawn as follows:\n\n1. Determine the total number of valence electrons: Sulfur (S) has 6 valence electrons, and oxygen (O) has 6 valence electrons. Since there are two oxygen atoms, the total number of valence electrons is 6 (S) + 2 * 6 (O) = 18 electrons.\n\n2. Place the least electronegative atom (Sulfur) in the center and surround it with the more electronegative atoms (Oxygen).\n\n      O\n      |\n      S\n      |\n      O\n\n3. Connect the central atom (S) to the surrounding atoms (O) with single bonds. This uses 4 of the 18 valence electrons.\n\n      O\n      |\n      S\n      |\n      O\n\n4. Complete the octets of the surrounding atoms (Oxygen) by adding lone pairs of electrons. Each oxygen atom needs 6 more electrons to complete its octet. This uses 12 of the remaining 14 valence electrons.\n\n      O\n    : | :\n      S\n    : | :\n      O\n\n5. Place any remaining electrons on the central atom (Sulfur). In this case, there are 2 remaining electrons, so we place them on the sulfur atom as a lone pair.\n\n      O\n    : | :\n      S :\n    : | :\n      O\n\n6. Check if the central atom (Sulfur) has a complete octet. In this case, sulfur has 10 electrons around it (4 from the single bonds and 2 from the lone pair), which exceeds the octet rule. However, sulfur can have an expanded octet due to its ability to use d-orbitals.\n\nThe Lewis structure of SO2 is:\n\n      O\n    : | :\n      S :\n    : | :\n      O"
