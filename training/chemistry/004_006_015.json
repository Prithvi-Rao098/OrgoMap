    "message_1": "What is the percentage purity of a given sample of aspirin when the melting point is determined to be 135째C? The literature melting point range for pure aspirin is 135-136째C.",
    "message_2": "Determining the percentage purity of a sample based solely on its melting point can be challenging, as impurities can cause the melting point to be lower than the pure substance. However, it is not possible to accurately quantify the percentage purity without additional information or experimental data.\n\nIn this case, the melting point of the aspirin sample is 135째C, which is at the lower end of the literature melting point range for pure aspirin (135-136째C). This suggests that the sample may have some impurities, but without further analysis, it is not possible to provide an exact percentage purity."
