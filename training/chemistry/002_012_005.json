    "message_2": "To calculate the bond order and bond length of the nitrogen-oxygen bond in nitric oxide (NO), we will follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Determine the molecular orbital configuration of NO\nNitrogen (N) has an atomic number of 7, so it has 7 electrons. Oxygen (O) has an atomic number of 8, so it has 8 electrons. Therefore, NO has a total of 15 electrons. The molecular orbital configuration of NO can be represented as follows:\n\nσ1s², σ*1s², σ2s², σ*2s², π2p^4, σ2p²\n\nStep 2: Calculate the bond order\nBond order is calculated using the formula:\n\nBond order = (Number of electrons in bonding orbitals - Number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\n\nIn the molecular orbital configuration of NO, there are 10 electrons in bonding orbitals (2 in σ1s, 2 in σ2s, 4 in π2p, and 2 in σ2p) and 4 electrons in antibonding orbitals (2 in σ*1s and 2 in σ*2s). Using the formula:\n\nBond order = (10 - 4) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3\n\nThe bond order of the nitrogen-oxygen bond in nitric oxide (NO) is 3.\n\nStep 3: Determine the bond length\nThe bond length of a molecule can be determined using experimental data or by comparing it to similar molecules. In the case of NO, the bond length has been experimentally determined to be approximately 1.15 Å (angstroms).\n\nIn conclusion, the nitrogen-oxygen bond in nitric oxide (NO) has a bond order of 3 and a bond length of approximately 1.15 Å."
