    "message_2": "The bond dissociation energy of hydrogen gas (H2) is the energy required to break the H-H bond in one mole of H2 molecules to form two moles of atomic hydrogen (H) in the gas phase. It is an important parameter to understand the stability and reactivity of a molecule.\n\nThe bond dissociation energy of H2 can be calculated using the enthalpy change (ΔH) of the reaction:\n\nH2(g) → 2H(g)\n\nThe enthalpy change of this reaction is equal to the bond dissociation energy, as it represents the energy required to break the H-H bond. For hydrogen gas (H2), the bond dissociation energy is approximately 436 kJ/mol.\n\nSo, the bond dissociation energy of H2 is 436 kJ/mol, and it can be calculated using the enthalpy change of the given reaction."
