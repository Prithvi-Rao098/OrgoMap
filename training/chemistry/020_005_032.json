    "message_2": "When additional reactants are introduced to a system at equilibrium, the concentration of the product will generally increase. This can be explained using Le Chatelier's principle, which states that when a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in concentration, temperature, or pressure, the system will adjust itself to counteract the change and re-establish equilibrium.\n\nAccording to Le Chatelier's principle, if the concentration of a reactant is increased, the system will respond by shifting the equilibrium position to consume the added reactant, thereby producing more product. This shift in equilibrium will continue until a new equilibrium position is reached, where the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction.\n\nFor example, consider the following reversible reaction:\n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) â‡Œ 2NH3(g)\n\nThis reaction represents the synthesis of ammonia (NH3) from nitrogen (N2) and hydrogen (H2) gases. If we were to increase the concentration of nitrogen or hydrogen gas in the system at equilibrium, the system would respond by shifting the equilibrium position to the right, favoring the forward reaction. This would result in an increase in the concentration of ammonia (the product) until a new equilibrium is established.\n\nIn summary, introducing additional reactants to a system at equilibrium will generally cause the concentration of the product to increase, as the system adjusts itself according to Le Chatelier's principle to re-establish equilibrium."
