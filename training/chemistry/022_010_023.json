    "message_2": "The balanced chemical equation for the precipitation reaction between silver nitrate (AgNO3) and sodium chloride (NaCl) is:\n\nAgNO3 (aq) + NaCl (aq) â†’ AgCl (s) + NaNO3 (aq)\n\nIn this reaction, silver nitrate and sodium chloride are both in aqueous solution, and they react to form a solid precipitate of silver chloride (AgCl) and an aqueous solution of sodium nitrate (NaNO3). This is an example of a double displacement reaction, also known as a metathesis reaction, where the cations and anions of the two reactants switch places to form two new products."
