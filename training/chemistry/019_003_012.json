    "message_2": "To find the specific heat capacity of water, we can use the formula:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the heat energy absorbed by the water, m is the mass of the water, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nFirst, we need to find the heat energy (Q) absorbed by the water. We are given the heating rate (power) as 100 W, and the heating time as 5 minutes (which we need to convert to seconds).\n\nPower (P) = Energy (Q) / Time (t)\nSo, Q = P × t\n\nThe heating time in seconds is:\n5 minutes × 60 seconds/minute = 300 seconds\n\nNow we can find the heat energy (Q):\nQ = 100 W × 300 seconds = 30000 J (joules)\n\nNext, we need to find the change in temperature (ΔT):\nΔT = T_final - T_initial = 40°C - 20°C = 20°C\n\nNow we have all the information needed to find the specific heat capacity (c) of water:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n30000 J = (50 g) × c × (20°C)\n\nNow we can solve for c:\nc = 30000 J / (50 g × 20°C) = 30000 J / 1000 g°C = 30 J/g°C\n\nThe specific heat capacity of water at 25°C is approximately 30 J/g°C. However, it is important to note that the generally accepted value for the specific heat capacity of water is 4.18 J/g°C. The discrepancy in this case may be due to experimental errors or other factors not accounted for in the problem."
