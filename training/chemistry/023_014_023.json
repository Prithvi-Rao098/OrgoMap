    "message_2": "The balanced chemical equation for the preparation of 4-bromoacetanilide from acetanilide and bromine is:\n\nC8H9NO + Br2 → C8H8BrNO + HBr\n\nTo calculate the theoretical yield of 4-bromoacetanilide, we first need to determine the number of moles of acetanilide used in the reaction. The molecular weight of acetanilide is approximately 135.17 g/mol.\n\nmoles of acetanilide = (mass of acetanilide) / (molecular weight of acetanilide)\nmoles of acetanilide = (5 g) / (135.17 g/mol) ≈ 0.037 mol\n\nSince the reaction has a 1:1 stoichiometry, the number of moles of 4-bromoacetanilide produced will be equal to the number of moles of acetanilide used.\n\nmoles of 4-bromoacetanilide = 0.037 mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the theoretical yield of 4-bromoacetanilide by multiplying the number of moles by its molecular weight. The molecular weight of 4-bromoacetanilide is approximately 214.06 g/mol.\n\ntheoretical yield of 4-bromoacetanilide = (moles of 4-bromoacetanilide) × (molecular weight of 4-bromoacetanilide)\ntheoretical yield of 4-bromoacetanilide = (0.037 mol) × (214.06 g/mol) ≈ 7.91 g\n\nSo, the theoretical yield of 4-bromoacetanilide is approximately 7.91 grams."
