    "message_1": "Assuming that the volume of the system is constant, how will the equilibrium concentration of reactants and products be affected if the temperature is increased for the following reaction: \n\n2 SO2(g) + O2(g) â‡Œ 2 SO3(g) \n\n(a) Predict the direction of the reaction shift and explain why\n(b) Predict the effect of the temperature change on the equilibrium value of Kc for the reaction.",
    "message_2": "(a) To predict the direction of the reaction shift, we need to determine whether the reaction is exothermic or endothermic. The formation of SO3 from SO2 and O2 is an exothermic reaction, meaning it releases heat. When the temperature is increased, the system will try to counteract this change by shifting the reaction in the direction that absorbs heat, which is the endothermic direction. In this case, the reaction will shift to the left, favoring the reactants (SO2 and O2).\n\n(b) The equilibrium constant, Kc, is affected by temperature changes. Since the reaction is exothermic, increasing the temperature will cause the equilibrium constant to decrease. This is because the reaction shifts to the left, favoring the reactants, and the ratio of products to reactants (which is represented by Kc) will decrease."
