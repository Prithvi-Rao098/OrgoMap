    "message_1": "What is the new equilibrium constant when the initial equilibrium constant for the reaction N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g) is 4.34 x 10^-3 at 298 K and the temperature of the system is increased to 350 K? The enthalpy change of the reaction is -92.4 kJ/mol and the entropy change is -198.5 J/K mol.",
    "message_2": "To find the new equilibrium constant at 350 K, we can use the van't Hoff equation:\n\nln(K2/K1) = -ΔH/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere K1 is the initial equilibrium constant at 298 K, K2 is the new equilibrium constant at 350 K, ΔH is the enthalpy change of the reaction, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/K mol), T1 is the initial temperature (298 K), and T2 is the final temperature (350 K).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the enthalpy change from kJ/mol to J/mol:\n\nΔH = -92.4 kJ/mol * (1000 J/1 kJ) = -92,400 J/mol\n\nNow we can plug in the values into the van't Hoff equation:\n\nln(K2/(4.34 x 10^-3)) = -(-92,400 J/mol) / (8.314 J/K mol) * (1/350 K - 1/298 K)\n\nSolve for K2:\n\nln(K2/(4.34 x 10^-3)) = 3.112\nK2/(4.34 x 10^-3) = e^3.112\nK2 = (4.34 x 10^-3) * e^3.112\nK2 ≈ 0.091\n\nSo, the new equilibrium constant (K2) at 350 K is approximately 0.091."
