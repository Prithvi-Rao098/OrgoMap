    "message_2": "To calculate the heat of sublimation of dry ice, we need to know the enthalpy of sublimation for CO2. The enthalpy of sublimation for CO2 is approximately 25.2 kJ/mol.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of dry ice (60 grams) to moles. The molar mass of CO2 is 44.01 g/mol.\n\nmoles of CO2 = 60 g / 44.01 g/mol = 1.363 moles\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat of sublimation for 1.363 moles of CO2:\n\nq_sublimation = moles × enthalpy of sublimation\nq_sublimation = 1.363 moles × 25.2 kJ/mol = 34.35 kJ\n\nTherefore, the heat of sublimation of 60 grams of dry ice at a constant pressure of 1 atm is approximately 34.35 kJ. Note that the initial and final temperatures are not relevant for this calculation, as the heat of sublimation is a constant value for a given substance."
