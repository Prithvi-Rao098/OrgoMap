    "message_2": "The standard enthalpy change for the sublimation of iodine (ΔH°) is given by the enthalpy of sublimation (ΔHsub°) for iodine. In this case, the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) for solid iodine is 0 kJ/mol, which means there is no additional energy change when considering the formation of solid iodine.\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the sublimation of iodine (ΔH°) is equal to the enthalpy of sublimation (ΔHsub°) for iodine:\n\nΔH° = ΔHsub° (Iodine) = 62.4 kJ/mol"
