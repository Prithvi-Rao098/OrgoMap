    "message_2": "To calculate the cell potential for the given electrochemical reaction, we need to find the difference in standard reduction potentials between the two half-reactions. The reaction is:\n\nZn(s) + Cu²⁺(aq) → Zn²⁺(aq) + Cu(s)\n\nThe half-reactions are:\n\nZn(s) → Zn²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ (oxidation)\nCu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Cu(s) (reduction)\n\nGiven standard reduction potentials are:\n\nE° (Zn²⁺/Zn) = -0.76 V\nE° (Cu²⁺/Cu) = +0.34 V\n\nSince Zn is being oxidized, we need to reverse the sign of its standard reduction potential to get the standard oxidation potential:\n\nE° (Zn/Zn²⁺) = +0.76 V\n\nNow, we can calculate the cell potential (E°cell) using the formula:\n\nE°cell = E°cathode - E°anode\n\nIn this case, Cu²⁺/Cu is the cathode (reduction) and Zn/Zn²⁺ is the anode (oxidation):\n\nE°cell = (+0.34 V) - (+0.76 V) = -0.42 V\n\nHowever, since the cell potential should be positive for a spontaneous reaction, we need to reverse the reaction:\n\nZn²⁺(aq) + Cu(s) → Zn(s) + Cu²⁺(aq)\n\nNow the half-reactions are:\n\nZn²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Zn(s) (reduction)\nCu(s) → Cu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ (oxidation)\n\nAnd the standard reduction potentials are:\n\nE° (Zn²⁺/Zn) = -0.76 V\nE° (Cu/Cu²⁺) = -0.34 V\n\nNow, we can calculate the cell potential (E°cell) using the formula:\n\nE°cell = E°cathode - E°anode\n\nIn this case, Zn²⁺/Zn is the cathode (reduction) and Cu/Cu²⁺ is the anode (oxidation):\n\nE°cell = (-0.76 V) - (-0.34 V) = 0.42 V\n\nSo, the cell potential for the given electrochemical reaction at 25°C is 0.42 V."
