    "message_2": "To calculate the melting point of a mixture of benzene and toluene, we can use the weighted average method. This method takes into account the mole fraction of each component and their respective melting points.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the mole fraction of each component:\n\nMole fraction of benzene (X_benzene) = moles of benzene / total moles\nX_benzene = 1 mol / (1 mol + 2 mol) = 1/3\n\nMole fraction of toluene (X_toluene) = moles of toluene / total moles\nX_toluene = 2 mol / (1 mol + 2 mol) = 2/3\n\nNow, we can calculate the weighted average melting point of the mixture:\n\nMelting point of mixture = (X_benzene * melting point of benzene) + (X_toluene * melting point of toluene)\nMelting point of mixture = (1/3 * 5.5 °C) + (2/3 * -95.0 °C)\n\nMelting point of mixture = (1/3 * 5.5) + (2/3 * -95)\nMelting point of mixture = 1.83 - 63.33\nMelting point of mixture = -61.5 °C\n\nTherefore, the melting point of the mixture of 1 mol of benzene and 2 mol of toluene is approximately -61.5 °C."
