Use the BET theory to calculate the surface area.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the maximum surface area covered by a monolayer of nitrogen molecules adsorbed on a solid surface using the BET theory, we need to consider the following information:\n\n1. Langmuir adsorption capacity: 50 micromoles/m²\n2. Cross-sectional area of a nitrogen molecule (N₂): 0.162 nm²\n\nFirst, we need to convert the Langmuir adsorption capacity to the number of nitrogen molecules per square meter:\n\n50 micromoles/m² * (6.022 x 10²³ molecules/mole) * (1 x 10⁻⁶ moles/micromole) = 3.011 x 10¹⁹ molecules/m²\n\nNow, we can use the cross-sectional area of a nitrogen molecule to calculate the total surface area covered by the monolayer:\n\nSurface area = (Number of molecules/m²) * (Cross-sectional area of a nitrogen molecule)\n\nSurface area = (3.011 x 10¹⁹ molecules/m²) * (0.162 x 10⁻¹⁸ m²/molecule)\n\nSurface area = 4.87782 x 10¹⁸ m²\n\nThus, the maximum surface area that can be covered by a monolayer of nitrogen molecules adsorbed on a solid surface is approximately 4.88 x 10¹⁸ m²."
