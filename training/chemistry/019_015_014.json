    "message_2": "The standard enthalpy change for the fusion of 1 mole of ice at 0°C and 1 atm pressure to liquid water at 0°C and 1 atm pressure is 6.01 kJ/mol. This value is given as the standard enthalpy of fusion of ice, which represents the energy required to convert 1 mole of ice to liquid water under standard conditions (0°C and 1 atm pressure)."
