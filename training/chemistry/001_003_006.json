    "message_2": "To determine the number of stereoisomers for 3-chloro-2-hydroxybutanoic acid, we need to identify the chiral centers in the molecule. Chiral centers are carbon atoms that have four different groups attached to them.\n\nThe structure of 3-chloro-2-hydroxybutanoic acid is as follows:\n\nCH3 - CH(OH) - CH(Cl) - COOH\n\nThere are two chiral centers in this molecule: the carbon with the hydroxyl group (C2) and the carbon with the chlorine atom (C3).\n\nFor each chiral center, there are two possible configurations (R and S). Since there are two chiral centers, the total number of stereoisomers is 2^n, where n is the number of chiral centers.\n\n2^2 = 4\n\nTherefore, there are 4 possible stereoisomers for 3-chloro-2-hydroxybutanoic acid."
