    "message_1": "Sure, here's a problem for a chemistry student to solve regarding the Calculation of the cell potential for a given electrochemical reaction:\n\nCalculate the cell potential for the following electrochemical reaction:\nZn(s) + 2Ag+(aq) → Zn2+(aq) + 2Ag(s)\nGiven: E°(Zn2+|Zn) = -0.76 V and E°(Ag+|Ag) = 0.80 V.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the cell potential for the given electrochemical reaction, we can use the Nernst equation. However, since we are given standard reduction potentials (E°), we can use a simplified version of the Nernst equation:\n\nE_cell = E°_cathode - E°_anode\n\nFirst, we need to identify the cathode and anode half-reactions. In this case, the reduction half-reaction is the one involving silver ions (Ag+), and the oxidation half-reaction is the one involving zinc metal (Zn).\n\nReduction half-reaction (cathode): Ag+(aq) + e- → Ag(s) with E°(Ag+|Ag) = 0.80 V\nOxidation half-reaction (anode): Zn(s) → Zn2+(aq) + 2e- with E°(Zn2+|Zn) = -0.76 V\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the simplified Nernst equation:\n\nE_cell = E°_cathode - E°_anode\nE_cell = 0.80 V - (-0.76 V)\nE_cell = 0.80 V + 0.76 V\nE_cell = 1.56 V\n\nSo, the cell potential for the given electrochemical reaction is 1.56 V."
