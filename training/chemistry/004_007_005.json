    "message_1": "What is the mass of calcium carbonate present in a soil sample if 10.00 grams of the sample was heated to constant mass, resulting in the formation of 1.23 grams of calcium oxide, assuming complete conversion of calcium carbonate to calcium oxide? Use gravimetric analysis to determine the answer.",
    "message_2": "To determine the mass of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) present in the soil sample, we will use the stoichiometry of the reaction between calcium carbonate and calcium oxide (CaO). The balanced chemical equation for the decomposition of calcium carbonate is:\n\nCaCO3 (s) â†’ CaO (s) + CO2 (g)\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of CaCO3 produces 1 mole of CaO. We will use this stoichiometric relationship to find the mass of CaCO3 in the soil sample.\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of CaO formed:\n\nMolar mass of CaO = 40.08 (Ca) + 16.00 (O) = 56.08 g/mol\n\nMoles of CaO = mass of CaO / molar mass of CaO\nMoles of CaO = 1.23 g / 56.08 g/mol = 0.0219 mol\n\nNow, we can use the stoichiometric relationship to find the moles of CaCO3:\n\nMoles of CaCO3 = moles of CaO = 0.0219 mol\n\nNext, we need to find the mass of CaCO3:\n\nMolar mass of CaCO3 = 40.08 (Ca) + 12.01 (C) + 3 * 16.00 (O) = 100.09 g/mol\n\nMass of CaCO3 = moles of CaCO3 * molar mass of CaCO3\nMass of CaCO3 = 0.0219 mol * 100.09 g/mol = 2.19 g\n\nTherefore, the mass of calcium carbonate present in the soil sample is 2.19 grams."
