    "message_2": "To determine the structure of a compound based on its IR and NMR spectra, I would need the actual spectra data, including the peaks and their intensities in both the IR and NMR spectra. Additionally, the type of NMR spectrum (1H, 13C, etc.) would be helpful. \n\nOnce I have the spectra data, I can analyze the functional groups present in the compound based on the IR spectrum and the chemical environment of the atoms (such as hydrogen or carbon) based on the NMR spectrum. By combining this information, I can propose a possible structure for the compound.\n\nPlease provide the spectra data, and I will be happy to help you determine the structure of the compound."
