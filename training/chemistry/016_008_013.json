    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat required to melt 50 grams of ice at 0°C, we can use the formula:\n\nq = n × ΔHf\n\nwhere q is the heat required, n is the number of moles of ice, and ΔHf is the enthalpy of fusion.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of ice. The molar mass of water (H2O) is 18.015 g/mol. \n\nn = mass / molar mass\nn = 50 g / 18.015 g/mol\nn ≈ 2.776 moles\n\nNow we can calculate the heat required using the enthalpy of fusion (6.01 kJ/mol):\n\nq = n × ΔHf\nq = 2.776 moles × 6.01 kJ/mol\nq ≈ 16.681 kJ\n\nTherefore, approximately 16.681 kJ of heat is required to melt 50 grams of ice at 0°C."
