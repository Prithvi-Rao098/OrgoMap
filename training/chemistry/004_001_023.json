    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of moles and the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and hydrochloric acid (HCl):\n\nNaOH + HCl → NaCl + H₂O\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of NaOH reacts with 1 mole of HCl. Now, we can use the given information to find the volume of the 0.1 M NaOH solution required to neutralize the 25 mL of 0.05 M HCl solution.\n\nFirst, let's find the moles of HCl in the 25 mL solution:\nmoles of HCl = Molarity × Volume\nmoles of HCl = 0.05 M × 0.025 L (since 25 mL = 0.025 L)\nmoles of HCl = 0.00125 moles\n\nSince 1 mole of NaOH reacts with 1 mole of HCl, we need 0.00125 moles of NaOH to neutralize the HCl solution. Now, we can find the volume of the 0.1 M NaOH solution required:\n\nVolume = moles of NaOH / Molarity of NaOH\nVolume = 0.00125 moles / 0.1 M\nVolume = 0.0125 L\n\nTo convert this to milliliters, we can multiply by 1000:\nVolume = 0.0125 L × 1000\nVolume = 12.5 mL\n\nSo, 12.5 mL of the 0.1 M sodium hydroxide solution is required to neutralize the 25 mL of the 0.05 M hydrochloric acid solution."
