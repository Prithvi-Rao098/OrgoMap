    "message_1": "What is the polarity of the bond between hydrogen and oxygen in a water molecule?",
    "message_2": "The bond between hydrogen and oxygen in a water molecule is polar. This is because oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen, resulting in an unequal sharing of electrons between the two atoms. The oxygen atom attracts the shared electrons more strongly, creating a partial negative charge on the oxygen and a partial positive charge on the hydrogen atoms. This leads to the formation of a polar covalent bond in the water molecule."
