    "message_2": "The bond dissociation energy of the carbon-hydrogen bond in methane (CH4) is the energy required to break one mole of C-H bonds in the molecule. In this case, the bond enthalpy of the C-H bond is given as 413 kJ/mol. Therefore, the bond dissociation energy of the C-H bond in methane is 413 kJ/mol."
