    "message_1": "Sure, here is a precise problem for the student to solve:\n\nA chemist has conducted an experiment to produce methanol from carbon monoxide and hydrogen gases. The balanced equation for this reaction is:\n\nCO (g) + 2H2 (g) -> CH3OH (l)\n\nThe chemist started with 10 grams of CO and 15 grams of H2. However, after conducting the experiment, the chemist only produced 12 grams of methanol. Calculate the percent yield of this experiment.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the percent yield, we first need to determine the theoretical yield, which is the maximum amount of product that can be formed from the given reactants.\n\n1. Calculate the moles of reactants:\nMoles of CO = mass / molar mass = 10 g / (28.01 g/mol) = 0.357 mol\nMoles of H2 = mass / molar mass = 15 g / (2.02 g/mol) = 7.43 mol\n\n2. Determine the limiting reactant:\nFor every mole of CO, 2 moles of H2 are required. So, we need 0.357 mol * 2 = 0.714 mol of H2 to react with all the CO. Since we have 7.43 mol of H2, which is more than enough, CO is the limiting reactant.\n\n3. Calculate the theoretical yield:\nUsing the stoichiometry of the balanced equation, 1 mole of CO produces 1 mole of CH3OH.\nTheoretical yield of CH3OH = moles of limiting reactant * (1 mol CH3OH / 1 mol CO) = 0.357 mol\nConvert moles of CH3OH to grams: 0.357 mol * (32.04 g/mol) = 11.43 g\n\n4. Calculate the percent yield:\nPercent yield = (actual yield / theoretical yield) * 100\nPercent yield = (12 g / 11.43 g) * 100 = 104.98%\n\nHowever, the percent yield cannot be greater than 100%. This discrepancy could be due to an error in the given data or a mistake in the experiment. In this case, we will assume that the actual yield was incorrectly reported, and the maximum percent yield should be 100%."
