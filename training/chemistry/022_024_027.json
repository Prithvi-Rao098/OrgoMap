    "message_2": "To find the pH of the buffer solution, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log ([A-]/[HA])\n\nwhere pH is the pH of the solution, pKa is the negative logarithm of the acid dissociation constant (Ka), [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate ion, CH3COO-), and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid (acetic acid, CH3COOH).\n\nFirst, we need to find the pKa value from the given Ka value:\n\nKa = 1.8 x 10^-5\npKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.8 x 10^-5) â‰ˆ 4.74\n\nNow, we can plug the concentrations of acetic acid and sodium acetate into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = 4.74 + log ([CH3COO-]/[CH3COOH])\n\nSince both acetic acid and sodium acetate have the same concentration (0.10 M), the ratio of [CH3COO-] to [CH3COOH] is 1:\n\npH = 4.74 + log (1) = 4.74\n\nTherefore, the pH of the buffer solution is approximately 4.74."
