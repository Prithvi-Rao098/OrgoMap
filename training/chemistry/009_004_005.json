    "message_2": "Nuclear fusion, specifically the deuterium-tritium (D-T) reaction, requires extremely high temperatures and pressures to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged nuclei and allow them to come close enough for the strong nuclear force to bind them together.\n\nThe minimum temperature required for the D-T reaction is approximately 100 million Kelvin (100 MK or 100 million degrees Celsius). At this temperature, the kinetic energy of the particles is high enough to overcome the electrostatic repulsion and initiate the fusion process.\n\nAs for pressure, it is not as straightforward to specify a minimum value, as it depends on the confinement method used to achieve and maintain the necessary temperature and density conditions for fusion. In general, the required pressure is in the range of hundreds of atmospheres to several million atmospheres, depending on the specific approach (e.g., magnetic confinement fusion or inertial confinement fusion).\n\nIt is important to note that achieving these extreme conditions for a controlled and sustained nuclear fusion reaction is a significant challenge, and research is ongoing to develop practical fusion energy systems."
