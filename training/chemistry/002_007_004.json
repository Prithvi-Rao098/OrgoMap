    "message_2": "When sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) reacts with barium chloride (BaCl2), a double displacement reaction occurs, also known as a metathesis reaction. In this reaction, the cations and anions of the two reactants switch places, forming new products. The expected products formed are barium sulfate (BaSO4) and sodium chloride (NaCl).\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nNa2SO4 (aq) + BaCl2 (aq) â†’ BaSO4 (s) + 2 NaCl (aq)\n\nIn this equation, the (aq) denotes that the compound is in aqueous solution, while the (s) denotes that the compound is a solid. Barium sulfate forms a precipitate in this reaction, as it is insoluble in water."
