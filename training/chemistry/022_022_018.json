    "message_2": "According to Le Chatelier's principle, when a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in concentration, temperature, or pressure, the system will adjust itself to counteract the change and restore a new equilibrium.\n\nIn this case, if we add more nitrogen gas (N2) to the system, the equilibrium will shift to counteract the increase in N2 concentration. The reaction will shift to the right, towards the formation of ammonia (NH3). This is because the system will try to consume the excess N2 by producing more NH3, thus partially restoring the equilibrium.\n\nIn summary, adding more nitrogen gas to the system will cause the equilibrium to shift to the right, favoring the formation of ammonia."
