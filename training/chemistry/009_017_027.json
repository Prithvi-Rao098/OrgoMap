    "message_2": "The decay equation for the positron emission of fluorine-18 is:\n\nF-18 → O-18 + e+ + νe\n\nIn this equation, F-18 (fluorine-18) undergoes positron emission and decays into O-18 (oxygen-18), a positron (e+), and a neutrino (νe).\n\nDuring this decay process, the atomic number (Z) decreases by 1, and the mass number (A) remains the same. Fluorine-18 has an atomic number of 9 and a mass number of 18. After the decay, oxygen-18 has an atomic number of 8 and a mass number of 18."
