    "message_2": "The major product formed in the elimination reaction of 2-methylcyclohexanol with concentrated sulfuric acid at high temperature is 1-methylcyclohexene. This reaction proceeds via an E1 mechanism, where the alcohol is first protonated by the sulfuric acid to form a good leaving group (water), and then a carbocation is formed at the 2-position. Finally, a Î²-hydrogen is removed, and the double bond is formed to give the more stable alkene, which is 1-methylcyclohexene due to the Zaitsev's rule."
