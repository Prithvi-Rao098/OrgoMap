    "message_2": "To calculate the lattice energy of magnesium oxide (MgO), we can use the Born-Haber cycle and the Coulomb's law. The lattice energy (U) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nU = k * (Q1 * Q2) / r\n\nwhere k is the electrostatic constant (8.9875517923 × 10^9 N m^2 C^-2), Q1 and Q2 are the charges of the ions, and r is the distance between the ions.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the distance between the ions from Å to meters:\n\n2.1 Å = 2.1 × 10^-10 m\n\nNow, we can calculate the lattice energy:\n\nU = (8.9875517923 × 10^9 N m^2 C^-2) * ((+2e) * (-2e)) / (2.1 × 10^-10 m)\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge (1.602176634 × 10^-19 C).\n\nU = (8.9875517923 × 10^9 N m^2 C^-2) * ((3.204353268 × 10^-19 C)^2) / (2.1 × 10^-10 m)\n\nU = (8.9875517923 × 10^9 N m^2 C^-2) * (1.027376583 × 10^-37 C^2) / (2.1 × 10^-10 m)\n\nU = 9.233 × 10^-28 N m\n\nNow, we need to convert the lattice energy from N m to kJ/mol. We can do this by multiplying by Avogadro's number (6.02214076 × 10^23 mol^-1) and dividing by 1000:\n\nU = (9.233 × 10^-28 N m) * (6.02214076 × 10^23 mol^-1) / 1000\n\nU = 5555.8 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the lattice energy of magnesium oxide (MgO) is approximately 5556 kJ/mol."
