    "message_2": "To synthesize phenylalanine from benzyl chloride and ammonia, you can follow the Strecker amino acid synthesis. This method involves three main steps: nitrile formation, nitrile hydrolysis, and final purification. Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Nitrile formation:\nFirst, you need to convert benzyl chloride to benzaldehyde. This can be done by reacting benzyl chloride with an oxidizing agent like N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of a catalyst like AIBN (azobisisobutyronitrile) to form benzaldehyde.\n\nBenzyl chloride + NBS + AIBN → Benzaldehyde\n\n2. Strecker synthesis:\nNext, you need to perform the Strecker synthesis to convert benzaldehyde to phenylalanine nitrile. To do this, react benzaldehyde with ammonia and hydrogen cyanide (HCN). The ammonia will form an imine intermediate with the aldehyde, which will then react with HCN to form the nitrile.\n\nBenzaldehyde + NH3 + HCN → Phenylalanine nitrile\n\nNote: Hydrogen cyanide is highly toxic and should be handled with extreme care.\n\n3. Nitrile hydrolysis:\nNow, you need to hydrolyze the phenylalanine nitrile to obtain phenylalanine. This can be done by reacting the nitrile with a strong acid like hydrochloric acid (HCl) and water under reflux conditions. The nitrile will be hydrolyzed to the corresponding amide, which will then be further hydrolyzed to the desired amino acid.\n\nPhenylalanine nitrile + HCl + H2O → Phenylalanine\n\n4. Purification:\nFinally, you need to purify the phenylalanine product. This can be done by recrystallization from water or by using chromatographic techniques such as ion-exchange chromatography.\n\nThis method allows for the efficient synthesis of phenylalanine from benzyl chloride and ammonia. However, it is important to handle all chemicals with care and follow proper safety procedures, especially when working with toxic compounds like hydrogen cyanide."
