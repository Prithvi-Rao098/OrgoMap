    "message_1": "A sample of an element has three isotopes: A, B, and C. Isotope A has a mass of 10u and makes up 20% of the sample. Isotope B has a mass of 11u and makes up 30% of the sample. Isotope C makes up the remaining 50% of the sample. What is the mass of Isotope C?",
    "message_2": "To find the mass of Isotope C, we can first calculate the average atomic mass of the element using the given information about the isotopes A and B, and the overall percentage of Isotope C.\n\nThe average atomic mass of the element can be calculated using the formula:\n\nAverage atomic mass = (mass of isotope A × % of isotope A) + (mass of isotope B × % of isotope B) + (mass of isotope C × % of isotope C)\n\nSince we know the percentages of all three isotopes, we can write the equation as:\n\nAverage atomic mass = (10u × 0.20) + (11u × 0.30) + (mass of isotope C × 0.50)\n\nNow, we can calculate the average atomic mass of the element using the information about isotopes A and B:\n\nAverage atomic mass = (10u × 0.20) + (11u × 0.30)\nAverage atomic mass = 2u + 3.3u\nAverage atomic mass = 5.3u\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the equation and solve for the mass of isotope C:\n\n5.3u = (10u × 0.20) + (11u × 0.30) + (mass of isotope C × 0.50)\n5.3u = 2u + 3.3u + (mass of isotope C × 0.50)\n\nNow, we can subtract the values on the right side of the equation from 5.3u:\n\n0 = (mass of isotope C × 0.50)\n\nSince 0.50 is half of 1, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for the mass of isotope C:\n\n0 = mass of isotope C\n\nThis result indicates that the mass of isotope C is 0u. However, this is not physically possible, as an isotope cannot have a mass of 0u. There must be an error in the given information or the problem statement. Please double-check the information provided and try again."
