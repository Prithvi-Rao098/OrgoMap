    "message_1": "What is the equilibrium constant expression for the following reaction? \n\n2 NO(g) + O2(g) ⇌ 2 NO2(g) \n\nGiven that the initial concentrations of NO, O2, and NO2 were 0.025 M, 0.015 M, and 0 M, respectively, calculate the equilibrium constant (Kc) at 25°C.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction, we first need to write the equilibrium constant expression. The equilibrium constant expression for the reaction is:\n\nKc = [NO2]^2 / ([NO]^2 * [O2])\n\nNow, we need to find the equilibrium concentrations of each species. Let's denote the change in concentration of each species by x:\n\n2 NO(g) + O2(g) ⇌ 2 NO2(g)\n-2x      -x         +2x\n\nInitial concentrations: 0.025 M (NO), 0.015 M (O2), and 0 M (NO2)\nEquilibrium concentrations: (0.025 - 2x) M (NO), (0.015 - x) M (O2), and (2x) M (NO2)\n\nNow, we can plug the equilibrium concentrations into the Kc expression:\n\nKc = [(2x)^2] / ([(0.025 - 2x)^2] * [(0.015 - x)])\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot solve for Kc without additional information, such as the equilibrium concentrations or the initial reaction rate. If you provide that information, we can proceed with the calculation."
