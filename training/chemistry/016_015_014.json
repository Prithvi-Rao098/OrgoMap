    "message_2": "To calculate the heat released when 50 g of water freezes to ice at -10°C, we need to consider two steps:\n\n1. Cooling the water from 0°C to -10°C\n2. Freezing the water at 0°C\n\nFirst, let's calculate the moles of water:\nMolar mass of water (H2O) = 18.015 g/mol\n50 g / 18.015 g/mol = 2.776 moles of water\n\nStep 1: Cooling the water from 0°C to -10°C\nSpecific heat capacity of ice = 2.09 J/g°C\nMass of water = 50 g\nTemperature change = -10°C\n\nq1 (heat released) = mass x specific heat capacity x temperature change\nq1 = 50 g x 2.09 J/g°C x (-10°C) = -1045 J\n\nStep 2: Freezing the water at 0°C\nHeat of crystallization for water = 6.01 kJ/mol\n\nq2 (heat released) = moles x heat of crystallization\nq2 = 2.776 moles x 6.01 kJ/mol = 16.68 kJ = 16680 J\n\nTotal heat released (q_total) = q1 + q2\nq_total = -1045 J + 16680 J = 15635 J\n\nSo, 15,635 J (15.635 kJ) of heat is released when 50 g of water freezes to ice at -10°C."
