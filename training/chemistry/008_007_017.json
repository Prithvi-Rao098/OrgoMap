    "message_2": "To determine the concentration of lead in a soil sample taken from a site near a smelter plant, you would need to perform a chemical analysis on the sample. This typically involves the following steps:\n\n1. Collect a representative soil sample from the site.\n2. Dry the soil sample and remove any debris or large particles.\n3. Crush and sieve the soil to obtain a fine, homogenous powder.\n4. Perform a chemical extraction to dissolve the lead present in the soil sample. This can be done using a strong acid, such as nitric acid or hydrochloric acid.\n5. Analyze the extracted solution using an analytical technique, such as atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), or inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), to determine the concentration of lead in the sample.\n\nOnce you have the concentration of lead in the soil sample, you can compare it to the safe limits set by environmental agencies. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set a soil lead hazard standard of 400 parts per million (ppm) for play areas and 1200 ppm for non-play areas in residential settings. Other countries and organizations may have different standards.\n\nIf the concentration of lead in the soil sample is above the safe limits, it may pose a risk to human health and the environment, and remediation efforts may be necessary to reduce the lead levels."
