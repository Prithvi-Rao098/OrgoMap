    "message_2": "The balanced chemical equation for the precipitation reaction between silver nitrate (AgNO3) and sodium chloride (NaCl) is:\n\nAgNO3(aq) + NaCl(aq) → AgCl(s) + NaNO3(aq)\n\nTo determine the mass of silver chloride (AgCl) formed, first, we need to find the limiting reactant. We can do this by calculating the moles of each reactant:\n\nMoles of AgNO3 = (volume in L) × (molarity) = (25.0 mL × 0.001 L/mL) × 0.250 M = 0.00625 mol\nMoles of NaCl = (volume in L) × (molarity) = (35.0 mL × 0.001 L/mL) × 0.200 M = 0.00700 mol\n\nNow, we compare the mole ratio of the reactants to the balanced equation:\n\nMole ratio of AgNO3 to NaCl = 0.00625 mol / 0.00700 mol = 0.8929\n\nSince the mole ratio is less than 1, AgNO3 is the limiting reactant. Now, we can calculate the moles of AgCl formed using the stoichiometry from the balanced equation:\n\nMoles of AgCl = moles of AgNO3 = 0.00625 mol\n\nFinally, we can calculate the mass of AgCl formed using its molar mass (143.32 g/mol):\n\nMass of AgCl = (moles of AgCl) × (molar mass of AgCl) = 0.00625 mol × 143.32 g/mol = 0.8958 g\n\nSo, the mass of silver chloride that will be formed is approximately 0.896 g."
