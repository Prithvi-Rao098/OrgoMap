    "message_2": "Synthesis Procedure for [Cu(NH3)4(H2O)2](NO3)2:\n\n1. Start with a clean and dry 250 mL beaker.\n2. Weigh out 5 grams of copper(II) nitrate trihydrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O) and add it to the beaker.\n3. Add 100 mL of distilled water to the beaker and stir the solution until the copper(II) nitrate is completely dissolved.\n4. In a separate container, prepare a 6 M ammonia solution (NH3) by mixing 40 mL of concentrated ammonia (28-30% NH3) with 60 mL of distilled water.\n5. Slowly add the ammonia solution to the copper(II) nitrate solution while stirring continuously. The solution will initially turn dark blue, indicating the formation of the tetraamminecopper(II) complex ([Cu(NH3)4](2+)).\n6. Continue stirring for a few more minutes to ensure complete complexation.\n7. Filter the solution through a Büchner funnel and filter paper to remove any impurities or unreacted copper(II) nitrate.\n8. Allow the filtrate to evaporate slowly at room temperature. Blue crystals of [Cu(NH3)4(H2O)2](NO3)2 will form over time (usually a few days).\n9. Collect the crystals by filtration, wash them with a small amount of cold distilled water, and let them air dry.\n\nSpectroscopic Characterization:\n\nFTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy):\nThe FTIR spectrum of [Cu(NH3)4(H2O)2](NO3)2 will show characteristic peaks corresponding to the vibrational modes of the different functional groups present in the complex. Some expected peaks are:\n\n- N-H stretching vibrations of the ammonia ligands: around 3300-3400 cm-1\n- O-H stretching vibrations of the water ligands: around 3200-3600 cm-1\n- N-O stretching vibrations of the nitrate anions: around 1300-1400 cm-1\n\nUV-Vis (Ultraviolet-Visible Spectroscopy):\nThe UV-Vis spectrum of [Cu(NH3)4(H2O)2](NO3)2 will show absorption bands corresponding to the d-d electronic transitions of the Cu(II) ion in the complex. The exact position of the bands depends on the ligand field splitting and the geometry of the complex. For the tetraamminecopper(II) complex, the absorption bands are typically observed around 600-800 nm, which corresponds to the blue color of the complex."
