    "message_2": "To determine the bond order for the oxygen molecule (O2) using molecular orbital theory, we need to first understand the molecular orbital diagram for oxygen. Oxygen has a total of 12 valence electrons (6 from each oxygen atom). The molecular orbitals are formed by the combination of atomic orbitals from each oxygen atom.\n\nThe molecular orbital diagram for O2 is as follows:\n\n1. Two 2s orbitals from each oxygen atom combine to form one sigma(2s) bonding orbital and one sigma*(2s) antibonding orbital.\n2. Two 2px orbitals from each oxygen atom combine to form one sigma(2px) bonding orbital and one sigma*(2px) antibonding orbital.\n3. Four 2py and 2pz orbitals from each oxygen atom combine to form two pi(2py, 2pz) bonding orbitals and two pi*(2py, 2pz) antibonding orbitals.\n\nNow, we need to fill the molecular orbitals with the 12 valence electrons. The order of filling is:\n\n1. sigma(2s)\n2. sigma*(2s)\n3. sigma(2px)\n4. pi(2py, 2pz)\n5. pi*(2py, 2pz)\n6. sigma*(2px)\n\nFilling the orbitals, we get:\n\n1. sigma(2s) - 2 electrons\n2. sigma*(2s) - 2 electrons\n3. sigma(2px) - 2 electrons\n4. pi(2py, 2pz) - 4 electrons (2 in each)\n5. pi*(2py, 2pz) - 2 electrons (1 in each)\n6. sigma*(2px) - 0 electrons\n\nNow, we can calculate the bond order using the formula:\n\nBond order = (number of electrons in bonding orbitals - number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\n\nBond order = (2 + 2 + 4 - 2 - 2) / 2 = (8 - 4) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2\n\nSo, the bond order of the oxygen molecule (O2) is 2.\n\nThe bond order is directly related to the stability of the molecule. A higher bond order indicates a stronger bond and greater stability. In the case of O2, a bond order of 2 suggests a relatively stable molecule with a double bond between the two oxygen atoms. This double bond results in a shorter bond length and higher bond energy, contributing to the overall stability of the oxygen molecule."
