    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction, we first need to determine the equilibrium concentrations of all species involved. The balanced chemical equation is:\n\n2 NO2(g) ⇌ N2O4(g)\n\nLet's use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations:\n\nInitial concentrations:\n[NO2] = 0.50 M\n[N2O4] = 0 M\n\nChange in concentrations:\nSince 2 moles of NO2 react to form 1 mole of N2O4, the change in concentration of NO2 is -2x, and the change in concentration of N2O4 is +x.\n\nEquilibrium concentrations:\n[NO2] = 0.50 - 2x\n[N2O4] = 0 + x = x\n\nWe are given that the equilibrium concentration of N2O4 is 0.30 M, so x = 0.30 M. Now we can find the equilibrium concentration of NO2:\n\n[NO2] = 0.50 - 2(0.30) = 0.50 - 0.60 = -0.10 M\n\nHowever, this result is not physically meaningful, as concentrations cannot be negative.
