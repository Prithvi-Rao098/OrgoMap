    "message_2": "To determine the percentage composition of a mixture of unknown hydrocarbons using gas chromatography (GC), you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Prepare the sample: Dissolve the mixture in a nonpolar solvent, as you have already done, and inject it into the GC column.\n\n2. Run the GC analysis: The GC instrument will separate the individual compounds in the mixture based on their boiling points and affinity to the stationary phase of the column. The compounds with lower boiling points will elute first, followed by those with higher boiling points.\n\n3. Analyze the chromatogram: The GC instrument will produce a chromatogram, which is a graphical representation of the detector response as a function of time. Each compound in the mixture will produce a peak in the chromatogram, with the area under the peak being proportional to the amount of that compound in the mixture.\n\n4. Identify the compounds: Compare the retention times of the peaks in the chromatogram to those of known hydrocarbon standards with boiling points in the 60째C to 120째C range. This will help you identify the compounds present in the mixture.\n\n5. Calculate the percentage composition: Measure the area under each peak in the chromatogram and divide it by the total area of all peaks. Multiply the result by 100 to obtain the percentage composition of each compound in the mixture.\n\nFor example, if the total area of all peaks is 1000 units and the area under the peak for compound A is 250 units, the percentage composition of compound A in the mixture would be (250/1000) x 100 = 25%.\n\nRepeat this calculation for each compound in the mixture to determine the percentage composition of all compounds."
