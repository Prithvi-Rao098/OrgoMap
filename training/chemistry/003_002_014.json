    "message_2": "To calculate the mole fraction of each component, we first need to find the total moles of the gas mixture. \n\nTotal moles = moles of methane + moles of ethane\nTotal moles = 0.5 moles (CH4) + 0.2 moles (C2H6)\nTotal moles = 0.7 moles\n\nNow we can calculate the mole fraction of each component:\n\nMole fraction of methane (CH4) = moles of methane / total moles\nMole fraction of CH4 = 0.5 moles / 0.7 moles\nMole fraction of CH4 = 0.714 (rounded to three decimal places)\n\nMole fraction of ethane (C2H6) = moles of ethane / total moles\nMole fraction of C2H6 = 0.2 moles / 0.7 moles\nMole fraction of C2H6 = 0.286 (rounded to three decimal places)\n\nNow we can calculate the partial pressures of each component using Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures:\n\nPartial pressure of methane (P_CH4) = mole fraction of CH4 × total pressure\nP_CH4 = 0.714 × 2 atm\nP_CH4 = 1.428 atm\n\nPartial pressure of ethane (P_C2H6) = mole fraction of C2H6 × total pressure\nP_C2H6 = 0.286 × 2 atm\nP_C2H6 = 0.572 atm\n\nThe total pressure of the gas mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of each component:\n\nTotal pressure = P_CH4 + P_C2H6\nTotal pressure = 1.428 atm + 0.572 atm\nTotal pressure = 2 atm\n\nSo, the mole fractions of methane and ethane are 0.714 and 0.286, respectively, and the total pressure of the gas mixture is 2 atm."
