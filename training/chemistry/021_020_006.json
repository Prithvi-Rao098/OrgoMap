    "message_2": "To calculate the heat of formation of methane (CH4), we can use Hess's Law, which states that the total enthalpy change of a reaction is the same, regardless of the path taken. In this case, we can use the given enthalpy changes to create a reaction pathway that will allow us to calculate the heat of formation of methane.\n\nFirst, let's write down the combustion reaction of methane:\n\nCH4 (g) + 2 O2 (g) → CO2 (g) + 2 H2O (l)  ΔH = -890.4 kJ mol^-1\n\nNow, let's write down the formation reactions for water and carbon dioxide:\n\nH2 (g) + 1/2 O2 (g) → H2O (l)  ΔH = -285.8 kJ mol^-1\nC (s) + O2 (g) → CO2 (g)  ΔH = -393.5 kJ mol^-1\n\nWe want to manipulate these reactions to find the formation reaction of methane. First, we need to reverse the combustion reaction of methane:\n\nCO2 (g) + 2 H2O (l) → CH4 (g) + 2 O2 (g)  ΔH = 890.4 kJ mol^-1\n\nNext, we need to multiply the formation reaction of water by 2 to match the number of moles of water in the reversed combustion reaction:\n\n2 [H2 (g) + 1/2 O2 (g) → H2O (l)]  ΔH = 2(-285.8) kJ mol^-1 = -571.6 kJ mol^-1\n\nNow, we can add the reversed combustion reaction, the formation reaction of carbon dioxide, and the multiplied formation reaction of water together:\n\nCO2 (g) + 2 H2O (l) → CH4 (g) + 2 O2 (g)  ΔH = 890.4 kJ mol^-1\nC (s) + O2 (g) → CO2 (g)  ΔH = -393.5 kJ mol^-1\n2 H2 (g) + O2 (g) → 2 H2O (l)  ΔH = -571.6 kJ mol^-1\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nC (s) + 2 H2 (g) → CH4 (g)  ΔH = ?\n\nNow, we can sum up the enthalpy changes:\n\nΔH = 890.4 kJ mol^-1 - 393.5 kJ mol^-1 - 571.6 kJ mol^-1 = -74.7 kJ mol^-1\n\nTherefore, the heat of formation of methane (CH4) is -74.7 kJ mol^-1."
