    "message_2": "To determine the half-life of the radioactive material, we can use the formula:\n\nN(t) = N0 * (1/2)^(t/T),\n\nwhere N(t) is the remaining activity at time t, N0 is the initial activity, t is the time elapsed, and T is the half-life of the material.\n\nIn this case, we are given that the activity has decayed down to 1/8 of its original activity after 30 days. So, we can write the equation as:\n\n1/8 * N0 = N0 * (1/2)^(30/T).\n\nNow, we can solve for T:\n\n1/8 = (1/2)^(30/T).\n\nTaking the logarithm of both sides:\n\nlog(1/8) = log((1/2)^(30/T)).\n\nUsing the logarithm property log(a^b) = b * log(a):\n\nlog(1/8) = (30/T) * log(1/2).\n\nNow, we can solve for T:\n\nT = 30 * log(1/2) / log(1/8).\n\nT ≈ 30 * (-0.3010) / (-0.9031) ≈ 10 days.\n\nSo, the half-life of the radioactive material is approximately 10 days."
