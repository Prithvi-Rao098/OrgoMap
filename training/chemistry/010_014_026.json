    "message_1": "What is the mass of copper deposited on a cathode during the electrolysis of a copper sulfate solution, if a current of 2.5 A is passed through the solution for a duration of 30 minutes? The molar mass of copper is 63.55 g/mol and the valency of copper is 2.",
    "message_2": "To find the mass of copper deposited on the cathode, we can use Faraday's laws of electrolysis. First, we need to find the total charge passed through the solution.\n\nTotal charge (Q) = Current (I) × Time (t)\nQ = 2.5 A × 30 minutes × (60 seconds/minute) = 2.5 × 1800 = 4500 Coulombs\n\nNow, we can use Faraday's constant (F) which is the charge of one mole of electrons: F = 96485 Coulombs/mol.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of moles of electrons (n) that have been transferred:\n\nn = Q / F\nn = 4500 / 96485 = 0.0466 moles of electrons\n\nSince the valency of copper is 2, it means that 2 moles of electrons are required to deposit 1 mole of copper. So, we can find the moles of copper deposited (n_Cu) as follows:\n\nn_Cu = n / 2\nn_Cu = 0.0466 / 2 = 0.0233 moles of copper\n\nNow, we can find the mass of copper deposited (m_Cu) using the molar mass of copper (M_Cu = 63.55 g/mol):\n\nm_Cu = n_Cu × M_Cu\nm_Cu = 0.0233 × 63.55 = 1.48 g\n\nTherefore, the mass of copper deposited on the cathode during the electrolysis is approximately 1.48 grams."
