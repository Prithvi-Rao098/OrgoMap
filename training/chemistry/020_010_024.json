    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n\nwhere pH is the final pH of the solution, pKa is the acid dissociation constant, [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base (NH3), and [HA] is the concentration of the conjugate acid (NH4+).\n\nFirst, we need to find the pKa of the NH3/NH4+ buffer system. The Kb (base dissociation constant) of NH3 is 1.8 x 10^-5. We can find the Ka (acid dissociation constant) of NH4+ using the relationship:\n\nKa * Kb = Kw\n\nwhere Kw is the ion product of water (1.0 x 10^-14). \n\nKa = Kw / Kb = (1.0 x 10^-14) / (1.8 x 10^-5) = 5.56 x 10^-10\n\nNow we can find the pKa:\n\npKa = -log(Ka) = -log(5.56 x 10^-10) = 9.25\n\nNext, we need to find the initial moles of NH3 and NH4+ in the solution. Since the volume of the solution is constant, we can use the initial concentrations to find the moles:\n\nmoles of NH3 = 0.1 M * volume\nmoles of NH4+ = 0.1 M * volume\n\nNow, when we add 0.01 moles of HCl, it will react with NH3 to form NH4+:\n\nNH3 + HCl → NH4+ + Cl-\n\nmoles of NH3 (final) = 0.1 M * volume - 0.01 moles\nmoles of NH4+ (final) = 0.1 M * volume + 0.01 moles\n\nSince the volume is constant, we can find the final concentrations by dividing the final moles by the volume:\n\n[NH3] (final) = (0.1 M * volume - 0.01 moles) / volume\n[NH4+] (final) = (0.1 M * volume + 0.01 moles) / volume\n\nNow we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the final pH:\n\npH = pKa + log([NH3] (final) / [NH4+] (final))\n\npH = 9.25 + log(((0.1 M * volume - 0.01 moles) / volume) / ((0.1 M * volume + 0.01 moles) / volume))\n\nSince the volume is constant, we can simplify the equation:\n\npH = 9.25 + log((0.1 M * volume - 0.01 moles) / (0.1 M * volume + 0.01 moles))\n\nNow we can plug in the values and solve for the final pH:\n\npH = 9.25 + log((0.1 * volume - 0.01) / (0.1 * volume + 0.01))\n\nSince the volume is constant and we are only interested in the change in pH, we can ignore the volume term:\n\npH = 9.25 + log((0.1 - 0.01) / (0.1 + 0.01))\n\npH = 9.25 + log(0.09 / 0.11)\n\npH ≈ 9.25 - 0.10\n\npH ≈ 9.15\n\nSo, the final pH of the solution after adding 0.01 moles of HCl is approximately 9.15."
