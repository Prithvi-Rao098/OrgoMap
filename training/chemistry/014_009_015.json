    "message_2": "In the [UO2Cl4]2- complex, the coordination number of Uranium is 6. This is because Uranium is surrounded by 2 oxygen atoms and 4 chlorine atoms, making a total of 6 ligands coordinated to the central metal atom.\n\nTo determine the oxidation state of Uranium, we can use the following equation:\n\nOxidation state of Uranium (U) + 2 * Oxidation state of Oxygen (O) + 4 * Oxidation state of Chlorine (Cl) = Charge of the complex\n\nSince the oxidation state of Oxygen is typically -2 and that of Chlorine is -1, the equation becomes:\n\nOxidation state of U + 2 * (-2) + 4 * (-1) = -2\n\nOxidation state of U - 4 - 4 = -2\n\nOxidation state of U = +6\n\nSo, the oxidation state of Uranium in the [UO2Cl4]2- complex is +6."
