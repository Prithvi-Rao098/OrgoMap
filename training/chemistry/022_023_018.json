    "message_2": "To find the pH of a 0.1M solution of acetic acid, we first need to determine the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in the solution. We can use the Ka expression to do this:\n\nKa = [H+][A-]/[HA]\n\nWhere Ka is the acid dissociation constant, [H+] is the concentration of hydrogen ions, [A-] is the concentration of acetate ions, and [HA] is the concentration of acetic acid.\n\nFor acetic acid, the Ka is given as 1.8 x 10^-5. Since the initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.1M, we can set up the equation as follows:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 = [H+][0.1 - H+]/[0.1]\n\nAssuming that the change in concentration of H+ is small compared to the initial concentration of acetic acid, we can simplify the equation to:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 = [H+](0.1)/[0.1]\n\nNow, we can solve for [H+]:\n\n[H+] = 1.8 x 10^-5\n\nFinally, we can calculate the pH using the formula:\n\npH = -log10[H+]\n\npH = -log10(1.8 x 10^-5)\n\npH â‰ˆ 4.74\n\nSo, the pH of a 0.1M solution of acetic acid is approximately 4.74."
