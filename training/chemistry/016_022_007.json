    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the isomerization of butene-1 to butene-2, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH = ΣΔHf(products) - ΣΔHf(reactants)\n\nIn this case, the reactant is butene-1 and the product is butene-2. Hydrogen gas is not involved in the isomerization process, so we don't need its enthalpy of formation.\n\nLet's denote the enthalpy of formation of butene-1 as ΔHf(butene-1) and the enthalpy of formation of butene-2 as ΔHf(butene-2).\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the equation:\n\nΔH = ΔHf(butene-2) - ΔHf(butene-1)\n\nPlease provide the enthalpies of formation for butene-1 and butene-2 to calculate the enthalpy change for the isomerization."
