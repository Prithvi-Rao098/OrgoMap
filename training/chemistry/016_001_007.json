    "message_2": "The enthalpy of formation of a compound is the change in enthalpy when one mole of the compound is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states. The balanced chemical equation for the formation of CO2 is:\n\nC (graphite) + O2 (g) → CO2 (g)\n\nThe enthalpy of formation for carbon (C) in its standard state (graphite) is 0 kJ/mol, not -94 kJ/mol as mentioned in the question. The enthalpy of formation for oxygen (O2) in its standard state (gas) is also 0 kJ/mol.\n\nTo find the enthalpy of formation for CO2, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔHf (CO2) = Σ [ΔHf (products)] - Σ [ΔHf (reactants)]\n\nIn this case, the reactants are C (graphite) and O2 (g), and the product is CO2 (g). Since the enthalpy of formation for both reactants is 0 kJ/mol, the equation simplifies to:\n\nΔHf (CO2) = ΔHf (CO2) - 0\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy of formation of CO2 is equal to the enthalpy of formation of CO2 itself. The standard enthalpy of formation for CO2 (g) is -393.5 kJ/mol."
