    "message_1": "What is the energy level of a gamma photon emitted when a nucleus of carbon-12 undergoes a transition from its excited state to its ground state, and what is the corresponding wavelength of the photon?",
    "message_2": "To determine the energy level of the gamma photon emitted during the transition, we need to know the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state of the carbon-12 nucleus. This information is not provided in the question, so I will assume a hypothetical energy difference of ΔE for the purpose of explaining the calculations.\n\nThe energy of the emitted gamma photon (E) can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nE = ΔE\n\nOnce we have the energy of the gamma photon, we can determine its wavelength (λ) using the Planck's equation:\n\nE = h * c / λ\n\nWhere h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) and c is the speed of light (3.0 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for λ, we get:\n\nλ = h * c / E\n\nNow, substituting the values of h, c, and E (ΔE) into the equation, we can calculate the wavelength of the gamma photon:\n\nλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (3.0 x 10^8 m/s) / ΔE\n\nWithout the specific energy difference (ΔE) between the excited and ground states of the carbon-12 nucleus, we cannot provide an exact numerical value for the wavelength. However, the equation above can be used to calculate the wavelength once the energy difference is known."
