    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the dissolution of 10 grams of potassium hydroxide (KOH) in 100 mL of water, we first need to determine the number of moles of KOH being dissolved. \n\nThe molar mass of KOH is:\nK = 39.10 g/mol\nO = 16.00 g/mol\nH = 1.01 g/mol\nTotal = 39.10 + 16.00 + 1.01 = 56.11 g/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of moles of KOH:\nmoles of KOH = mass of KOH / molar mass of KOH\nmoles of KOH = 10 g / 56.11 g/mol = 0.1782 mol\n\nNext, we can use the molar enthalpy of dissolution to find the enthalpy change for the dissolution of 0.1782 mol of KOH:\nΔH = moles of KOH × molar enthalpy of dissolution\nΔH = 0.1782 mol × (-57.61 kJ/mol) = -10.27 kJ\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the dissolution of 10 grams of potassium hydroxide (KOH) in 100 mL of water is -10.27 kJ."
