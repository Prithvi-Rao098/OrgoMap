    "message_2": "HCl is a strong acid, which means it dissociates completely in water. Therefore, the concentration of H+ ions in the solution will be equal to the concentration of HCl. \n\n[H+] = 0.1 M\n\nTo find the pH of the solution, use the pH formula:\n\npH = -log10[H+]\n\npH = -log10(0.1)\n\npH = 1\n\nThe pH of the 0.1 M HCl solution is 1."
