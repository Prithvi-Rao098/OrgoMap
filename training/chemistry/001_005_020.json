    "message_2": "There are a total of 5 structural isomers of C6H14 that belong to the alkane and cycloalkane families. Here are the names and structures of each isomer:\n\n1. n-Hexane (straight-chain alkane)\n   Structure: CH3-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3\n\n2. 2-Methylpentane (branched-chain alkane)\n   Structure: CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3\n\n3. 3-Methylpentane (branched-chain alkane)\n   Structure: CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3\n\n4. 2,2-Dimethylbutane (branched-chain alkane)\n   Structure: CH3-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH3\n\n5. Cyclohexane (cycloalkane)\n   Structure: A six-membered ring with each carbon atom bonded to two hydrogen atoms.\n\nNote that the structures are represented in a condensed format, and you would need to draw them out to visualize their shapes."
