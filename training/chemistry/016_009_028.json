    "message_2": "To find the enthalpy of vaporization of ethanol, we need to know the amount of heat required to vaporize 50 grams of ethanol at its boiling point. We can use the formula:\n\nQ = m * ΔHvap\n\nwhere Q is the heat required, m is the mass of ethanol, and ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization.\n\nWe are given the specific heat capacity of ethanol (c) as 2.44 J/(g•°C) and the boiling point (Tb) as 78.5 °C. However, we need to know the initial temperature (Ti) of the ethanol to calculate the heat required to raise its temperature to the boiling point. Let's assume the initial temperature is 25 °C.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the heat required to raise the temperature of ethanol to its boiling point:\n\nQ1 = mcΔT = (50 g)(2.44 J/(g•°C))(78.5 °C - 25 °C) = 6537 J\n\nNow, we can use this value to find the enthalpy of vaporization:\n\nQ = m * ΔHvap\n6537 J = 50 g * ΔHvap\n\nΔHvap = 6537 J / 50 g = 130.74 J/g\n\nThe enthalpy of vaporization of ethanol is approximately 130.74 J/g."
