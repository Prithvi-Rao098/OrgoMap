    "message_2": "Temperature plays a crucial role in the phase transition of liquid crystals from the nematic to the isotropic phase. Liquid crystals are unique materials that exhibit properties between those of conventional liquids and solid crystals. In the nematic phase, the molecules are arranged in a parallel but not ordered manner, while in the isotropic phase, the molecules are randomly oriented and have no specific order.\n\nAs temperature increases, the thermal energy of the liquid crystal molecules also increases. This added energy causes the molecules to move more rapidly and randomly, which disrupts the parallel orientation of the molecules in the nematic phase. When the temperature reaches a certain threshold, known as the clearing point or nematic-isotropic transition temperature, the order of the nematic phase is lost, and the liquid crystal transitions to the isotropic phase.\n\nConversely, when the temperature is decreased, the thermal energy of the molecules decreases, and the molecules begin to align themselves in a more parallel manner, eventually transitioning back to the nematic phase when the temperature drops below the clearing point.\n\nIn summary, temperature affects the phase transition of liquid crystals from the nematic to the isotropic phase by influencing the molecular orientation and order. Increasing the temperature leads to a transition from the nematic to the isotropic phase, while decreasing the temperature results in a transition back to the nematic phase."
