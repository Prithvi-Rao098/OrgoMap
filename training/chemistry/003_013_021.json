    "message_1": "A cylinder with a volume of 2.5 L contains 1.5 moles of an ideal gas at a pressure of 5 atm. The gas is allowed to expand isothermally against a constant external pressure of 1 atm until the volume doubles. Calculate the work done by the gas during the expansion process.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the work done by the gas during the isothermal expansion, we can use the formula:\n\nW = -P_ext * ΔV\n\nwhere W is the work done, P_ext is the external pressure, and ΔV is the change in volume.\n\nSince the volume doubles, the final volume (V_f) will be:\n\nV_f = 2 * V_i = 2 * 2.5 L = 5 L\n\nThe change in volume (ΔV) is:\n\nΔV = V_f - V_i = 5 L - 2.5 L = 2.5 L\n\nNow we can calculate the work done:\n\nW = -P_ext * ΔV = -1 atm * 2.5 L\n\nTo convert the work done to joules, we need to use the conversion factor: 1 L·atm = 101.325 J\n\nW = -1 atm * 2.5 L * (101.325 J / 1 L·atm) = -253.3125 J\n\nSo, the work done by the gas during the expansion process is approximately -253.31 J. The negative sign indicates that the work is done by the gas (expansion)."
