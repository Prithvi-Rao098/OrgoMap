    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the sublimation of iodine solid to iodine gas at 298 K, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH_sublimation = ΔH_fusion + ΔH_vaporization\n\nFirst, we need to find the enthalpy of vaporization (ΔH_vaporization) using the given data. We can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nΔH_vaporization = T * (ΔS_gas - ΔS_solid)\n\nwhere T is the temperature in Kelvin, ΔS_gas is the standard molar entropy of iodine gas, and ΔS_solid is the standard molar entropy of iodine solid.\n\nΔH_vaporization = 298 K * (260.6 J/K/mol - 62.7 J/K/mol)\nΔH_vaporization = 298 K * (197.9 J/K/mol)\nΔH_vaporization = 59042 J/mol\nΔH_vaporization = 59.042 kJ/mol\n\nNow we can calculate the enthalpy change for the sublimation:\n\nΔH_sublimation = ΔH_fusion + ΔH_vaporization\nΔH_sublimation = 15.52 kJ/mol + 59.042 kJ/mol\nΔH_sublimation = 74.562 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the sublimation of iodine solid to iodine gas at 298 K is 74.562 kJ/mol."
