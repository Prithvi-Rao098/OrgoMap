    "message_1": "What is the solubility of calcium carbonate in water at 25°C and how can it be increased or decreased?",
    "message_2": "The solubility of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in water at 25°C is quite low, approximately 15 mg/L or 0.015 g/L. This means that only 15 milligrams of calcium carbonate can dissolve in 1 liter of water at this temperature.\n\nThere are several ways to increase or decrease the solubility of calcium carbonate in water:\n\n1. Temperature: Generally, the solubility of most salts increases with temperature. However, the solubility of calcium carbonate decreases with increasing temperature. So, to increase the solubility of CaCO3, you can lower the temperature, and to decrease its solubility, you can raise the temperature.\n\n2. pH: The solubility of calcium carbonate is also affected by the pH of the solution. It is more soluble in acidic solutions (lower pH) because the carbonate ion (CO3^2-) reacts with the hydrogen ions (H+) to form bicarbonate ions (HCO3^-). To increase the solubility of CaCO3, you can add an acid (e.g., hydrochloric acid, HCl) to the solution, which will lower the pH. To decrease the solubility, you can add a base (e.g., sodium hydroxide, NaOH) to increase the pH.\n\n3. Common ion effect: The presence of a common ion in the solution can also affect the solubility of calcium carbonate. According to Le Chatelier's principle, if a common ion is added to a solution, the solubility of the salt will decrease. For example, if you add calcium chloride (CaCl2) or sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) to the solution, the solubility of CaCO3 will decrease due to the common ion effect.\n\n4. Complexation: The solubility of calcium carbonate can be increased by forming soluble complexes with other ions or molecules. For example, adding a chelating agent like ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) can increase the solubility of CaCO3 by forming a soluble complex with the calcium ions."
