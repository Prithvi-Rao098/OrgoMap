    "message_2": "To find the nuclear binding energy for a single oxygen-16 atom, we need to convert the given binding energy per mole to binding energy per atom. We can do this by dividing the binding energy per mole by Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol).\n\nGiven:\nBinding energy per mole of oxygen-16 = -1.412 x 10^10 J/mol\n\nNow, divide this by Avogadro's number:\n\nBinding energy per atom = (-1.412 x 10^10 J/mol) / (6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol)\n\nBinding energy per atom = -2.344 x 10^-14 J\n\nSo, the nuclear binding energy for an oxygen-16 atom is approximately -2.344 x 10^-14 joules."
