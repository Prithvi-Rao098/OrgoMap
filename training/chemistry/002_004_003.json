    "message_1": "What is the pH of a solution prepared by mixing 50 mL of 0.1 M hydrochloric acid with 100 mL of 0.05 M sodium hydroxide?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to first determine the moles of HCl and NaOH in the solution and then find the resulting concentration of H+ or OH- ions to calculate the pH.\n\n1. Calculate the moles of HCl and NaOH:\nmoles of HCl = volume (L) × concentration (M)\nmoles of HCl = 0.050 L × 0.1 M = 0.005 moles\n\nmoles of NaOH = volume (L) × concentration (M)\nmoles of NaOH = 0.100 L × 0.05 M = 0.005 moles\n\n2. Determine the reaction between HCl and NaOH:\nHCl + NaOH → NaCl + H2O\n\nSince both HCl and NaOH have equal moles (0.005 moles), they will completely react with each other, and there will be no excess H+ or OH- ions in the solution.\n\n3. Calculate the pH of the resulting solution:\nSince there are no excess H+ or OH- ions, the resulting solution is neutral, and the pH is 7."
