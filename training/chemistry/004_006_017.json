    "message_2": "To determine the purity percentage of an unknown powdered substance X based on its melting point and comparison with a known substance of the same type, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the melting point of the known pure substance: Look up the melting point of the known pure substance in a reference book or a reliable online source. This value will be used as a reference for comparison.\n\n2. Determine the melting point of the unknown substance X: To do this, you will need to perform a melting point experiment using a melting point apparatus. Place a small amount of the unknown substance X in a capillary tube and heat it in the melting point apparatus. Record the temperature at which the substance starts to melt and the temperature at which it completely melts. The melting point is the average of these two temperatures.\n\n3. Compare the melting points: If the melting point of the unknown substance X is the same as the melting point of the known pure substance, then the unknown substance X is likely to be pure. If the melting point of the unknown substance X is lower than the melting point of the known pure substance, it indicates that the unknown substance X is impure.\n\n4. Determine the purity percentage: To determine the purity percentage, you can use the melting point depression method. This method is based on the fact that the melting point of a mixture is lower than the melting point of the pure substance. The formula for calculating the purity percentage is:\n\nPurity percentage = [(melting point of pure substance - melting point of unknown substance) / (melting point of pure substance - melting point of eutectic mixture)] Ã— 100\n\nHowever, this method requires knowing the melting point of the eutectic mixture, which is the lowest possible melting point of a mixture of the two substances. This information may not always be readily available.\n\nIt's important to note that this method provides an estimate of the purity percentage and may not be entirely accurate. Other methods, such as chromatography or spectroscopy, can provide more accurate results for determining the purity of a substance."
