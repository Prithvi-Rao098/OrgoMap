    "message_1": "What is the bond length between a carbon atom (C) and an oxygen atom (O) in a carbon dioxide molecule (CO2), given that the distance between the carbon and oxygen atoms is 1.16 Å?",
    "message_2": "The bond length between a carbon atom (C) and an oxygen atom (O) in a carbon dioxide molecule (CO2) is 1.16 Å (angstroms), as given in the problem. An angstrom (Å) is a unit of length equal to 10^-10 meters or 0.1 nanometers. So, the bond length between C and O in CO2 is 1.16 Å or 116 picometers."
