    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the dissolution of NaOH, we first need to determine the number of moles of NaOH being dissolved. \n\n1. Calculate the moles of NaOH:\nNaOH has a molar mass of 22.99 g/mol (Na) + 15.999 g/mol (O) + 1.007 g/mol (H) = 39.996 g/mol.\n\nmoles of NaOH = mass / molar mass\nmoles of NaOH = 5.36 g / 39.996 g/mol = 0.134 mol\n\n2. Calculate the enthalpy change:\nNow that we have the moles of NaOH, we can calculate the enthalpy change using the molar enthalpy of dissolution.\n\nΔH = moles × molar enthalpy of dissolution\nΔH = 0.134 mol × (-44.5 kJ/mol)\nΔH = -5.963 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the dissolution of 5.36 g of NaOH in 100.0 mL of water is -5.963 kJ."
