    "message_2": "In photochemistry, the photochemical properties of enantiomers can differ due to their chiral nature. Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, which means they have the same molecular formula and connectivity but differ in the spatial arrangement of their atoms. This difference in spatial arrangement can lead to different interactions with light and other molecules, affecting the outcome of their photochemical reactions.\n\nOne key aspect of the photochemical properties of enantiomers is their ability to interact with plane-polarized light. Enantiomers can rotate the plane of polarized light in opposite directions, a phenomenon known as optical activity. This optical activity can influence the way enantiomers absorb and emit light, as well as their ability to participate in photochemical reactions.\n\nThe photochemical reactions of enantiomers can be influenced by several factors, including the wavelength and polarization of the light source, the presence of other chiral molecules, and the specific reaction conditions. In some cases, enantiomers may undergo different photochemical reactions or produce different products due to their distinct stereochemistry.\n\nAn example of a photochemical reaction that demonstrates the differences between enantiomers is the photoisomerization of chiral cyclohexadiene derivatives. In this reaction, enantiomers of a chiral cyclohexadiene can undergo photoisomerization to form different diastereomeric products upon exposure to light. The specific diastereomeric product formed depends on the stereochemistry of the starting enantiomer and the reaction conditions.\n\nFor instance, consider a chiral cyclohexadiene derivative with a substituent at the 1-position and a double bond between the 2- and 3-positions. Upon exposure to light, one enantiomer may undergo photoisomerization to form a diastereomeric product with the substituent at the 1-position and a double bond between the 3- and 4-positions. In contrast, the other enantiomer may undergo photoisomerization to form a different diastereomeric product with the substituent at the 1-position and a double bond between the 4- and 5-positions.\n\nIn summary, the photochemical properties of enantiomers can differ due to their chiral nature, leading to different outcomes in photochemical reactions. The example of chiral cyclohexadiene photoisomerization demonstrates how enantiomers can produce different diastereomeric products upon exposure to light, highlighting the importance of stereochemistry in photochemical reactions."
