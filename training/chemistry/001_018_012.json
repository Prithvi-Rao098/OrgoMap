    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the pKa of benzoic acid. The pKa value is a measure of the acidity of a substance, with lower values indicating stronger acids.\n\nThe pKa of benzoic acid is approximately 4.20.\n\nNow, let's discuss how this pKa value affects the acidity of benzoic acid in water. The pKa value is related to the equilibrium constant (Ka) for the dissociation of the acid in water, as follows:\n\npKa = -log10(Ka)\n\nA lower pKa value means a higher Ka value, which indicates that the acid dissociates more readily in water, producing more hydronium ions (H₃O⁺) and increasing the acidity of the solution.\n\nIn the case of benzoic acid, its pKa of 4.20 indicates that it is a weak acid, meaning it does not dissociate completely in water. However, it is still acidic enough to donate a proton (H⁺) to water, forming the benzoate ion (C₇H₅O₂⁻) and a hydronium ion (H₃O⁺):\n\nC₇H₆O₂ (aq) + H₂O (l) ⇌ C₇H₅O₂⁻ (aq) + H₃O⁺ (aq)\n\nThe pKa value of benzoic acid allows us to predict the extent of this reaction and the resulting acidity of the solution. Since the pKa is 4.20, we can expect the pH of a solution of benzoic acid in water to be somewhat acidic, but not as acidic as a strong acid like hydrochloric acid (HCl) with a pKa of -6.3."
