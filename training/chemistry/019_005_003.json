    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) for the combustion of methane, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG° = Σ(ΔG°f products) - Σ(ΔG°f reactants)\n\nwhere ΔG°f represents the standard Gibbs free energy of formation for each species involved in the reaction.\n\nFor the given reaction, we have:\n\nΔG° = [1 × (-394.36 kJ/mol) + 2 × (-237.13 kJ/mol)] - [1 × (-50.8 kJ/mol) + 2 × 0 kJ/mol]\n\nΔG° = (-394.36 - 474.26 + 50.8) kJ/mol\n\nΔG° = -817.82 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the Gibbs free energy change for the combustion of methane gas to produce carbon dioxide and water vapor at a temperature of 298K and a pressure of 1 atm is -817.82 kJ/mol."
