    "message_2": "When potassium chlorate (KClO3) is heated, it undergoes a decomposition reaction to form potassium chloride (KCl) and oxygen gas (O2). The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\n2 KClO3 (s) â†’ 2 KCl (s) + 3 O2 (g)\n\nThe products formed are potassium chloride (KCl) and oxygen gas (O2)."
