    "message_2": "To calculate the formal charge of the nitrogen atom in the nitrate ion (NO3-), we will use the following formula:\n\nFormal charge = (Valence electrons of the atom) - (Non-bonding electrons) - (1/2 × Bonding electrons)\n\nIn the nitrate ion, nitrogen is bonded to three oxygen atoms through two single bonds and one double bond. Nitrogen has 5 valence electrons, and there are no non-bonding electrons on the nitrogen atom in this case.\n\nLet's count the bonding electrons:\n- Two single bonds to oxygen atoms: 2 × 2 = 4 electrons\n- One double bond to an oxygen atom: 2 × 2 = 4 electrons\n- Total bonding electrons: 4 + 4 = 8 electrons\n\nNow, we can calculate the formal charge of the nitrogen atom:\n\nFormal charge = (5) - (0) - (1/2 × 8)\nFormal charge = 5 - 0 - 4\nFormal charge = +1\n\nThe formal charge of the nitrogen atom in the nitrate ion (NO3-) is +1.\n\nNow, let's determine if the nitrate ion is a stable or unstable species based on formal charge. The overall charge of the nitrate ion is -1, which is the sum of the formal charges of all atoms in the ion. The formal charges of the three oxygen atoms are -2, -1, and -1, respectively. When we add these formal charges to the formal charge of the nitrogen atom (+1), we get:\n\nOverall charge = +1 + (-2) + (-1) + (-1) = -1\n\nSince the overall charge of the nitrate ion is equal to its actual charge (-1), the nitrate ion is considered a stable species. The formal charges are distributed in such a way that they minimize the overall charge and follow the octet rule, making the nitrate ion a stable and common polyatomic ion."
