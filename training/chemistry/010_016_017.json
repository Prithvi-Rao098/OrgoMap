    "message_1": "A copper electrode is immersed in a 0.1M solution of CuSO4 and a zinc electrode is immersed in 0.1M solution of ZnSO4. Both the solutions are connected with a salt bridge. If the standard reduction potentials of Cu2+/Cu and Zn2+/Zn are +0.34V and -0.76 V respectively, calculate the potential difference between the two electrodes at 25°C.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the potential difference between the two electrodes, we can use the Nernst equation. However, since both solutions have the same concentration (0.1M), the Nernst equation simplifies to the difference in standard reduction potentials.\n\nThe cell potential (E_cell) can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nE_cell = E_cathode - E_anode\n\nIn this case, the copper electrode has a higher standard reduction potential, so it will act as the cathode, and the zinc electrode will act as the anode.\n\nE_cathode = +0.34 V (Cu2+/Cu)\nE_anode = -0.76 V (Zn2+/Zn)\n\nNow, we can calculate the cell potential:\n\nE_cell = (+0.34 V) - (-0.76 V)\nE_cell = 0.34 V + 0.76 V\nE_cell = 1.10 V\n\nThe potential difference between the two electrodes at 25°C is 1.10 V."
