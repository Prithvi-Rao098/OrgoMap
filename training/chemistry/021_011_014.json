    "message_2": "The bond dissociation energy (BDE) of a molecule is the energy required to break a specific chemical bond and form isolated atoms. In the case of methane (CH4), there are four C-H bonds. The BDE of a single C-H bond in methane is approximately 435 kJ/mol.\n\nSince there are four C-H bonds in methane, we need to multiply the BDE of a single C-H bond by the number of bonds:\n\nBDE (CH4) = BDE (C-H) × number of C-H bonds\nBDE (CH4) = 435 kJ/mol × 4\nBDE (CH4) = 1740 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the bond dissociation energy of a methane molecule (CH4) is approximately 1740 kJ/mol, assuming that all the bonds are broken simultaneously and the products are isolated atoms."
