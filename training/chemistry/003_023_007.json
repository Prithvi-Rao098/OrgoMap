    "message_2": "To calculate the heat evolved when NaOH is dissolved in water, we need to determine the number of moles of NaOH and then use the enthalpy of solution to find the heat evolved.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of moles of NaOH:\n\nNaOH has a molar mass of 22.99 g/mol (Na) + 15.999 g/mol (O) + 1.007 g/mol (H) = 39.996 g/mol.\n\nNow, we can find the number of moles:\n\nmoles of NaOH = mass / molar mass\nmoles of NaOH = 25 g / 39.996 g/mol = 0.625 mol\n\nNow, we can use the enthalpy of solution to find the heat evolved:\n\nHeat evolved = moles of NaOH × enthalpy of solution\nHeat evolved = 0.625 mol × -44.5 kJ/mol = -27.8125 kJ\n\nSince the enthalpy of solution is negative, the heat is evolved (exothermic reaction), and the heat evolved is 27.8125 kJ."
