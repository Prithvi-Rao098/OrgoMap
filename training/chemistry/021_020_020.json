    "message_2": "The heat of formation of water (H2O) can be calculated using the given enthalpy change of the reaction:\n\n2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(l); ΔH = -484 kJ/mol\n\nSince the reaction produces 2 moles of H2O, we need to divide the enthalpy change by 2 to find the heat of formation for 1 mole of H2O:\n\nHeat of formation of H2O = (-484 kJ/mol) / 2 = -242 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the heat of formation of water (H2O) at standard conditions (25°C and 1 atm pressure) is -242 kJ/mol."
