What is the value of the enthalpy of fusion of ice, given that the specific heat of ice is 2.09 J/g°C, the specific heat of liquid water is 4.18 J/g°C, and the heat capacity of the calorimeter used is 10.0 J/°C?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total heat absorbed by the ice during the entire process. This process consists of three steps:\n\n1. Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C\n2. Melting the ice at 0°C\n3. Heating the liquid water from 0°C to 20°C\n\nStep 1: Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C\nq1 = (mass of ice) × (specific heat of ice) × (change in temperature)\nq1 = 25 g × 2.09 J/g°C × (0°C - (-10°C))\nq1 = 25 g × 2.09 J/g°C × 10°C\nq1 = 522.5 J\n\nStep 2: Melting the ice at 0°C\nWe will denote the enthalpy of fusion of ice as ΔHfus. This is the value we need to find.\n\nq2 = (mass of ice) × ΔHfus\nq2 = 25 g × ΔHfus\n\nStep 3: Heating the liquid water from 0°C to 20°C\nq3 = (mass of water) × (specific heat of water) × (change in temperature)\nq3 = 25 g × 4.18 J/g°C × (20°C - 0°C)\nq3 = 25 g × 4.18 J/g°C × 20°C\nq3 = 2090 J\n\nNow, we need to consider the heat capacity of the calorimeter. The total heat absorbed by the calorimeter is equal to the sum of the heat absorbed in each step.\n\nq_total = q1 + q2 + q3\nq_total = 522.5 J + 25 g × ΔHfus + 2090 J\n\nSince the calorimeter absorbs all the heat, we can use its heat capacity to find the total heat absorbed:\n\nq_total = (heat capacity of calorimeter) × (change in temperature)\nq_total = 10.0 J/°C × (20°C - (-10°C))\nq_total = 10.0 J/°C × 30°C\nq_total = 300 J\n\nNow, we can solve for ΔHfus:\n\n300 J = 522.5 J + 25 g × ΔHfus + 2090 J\n-2312.5 J = 25 g × ΔHfus\nΔHfus = -2312.5 J / 25 g\nΔHfus = -92.5 J/g\n\nThe enthalpy of fusion of ice is -92.5 J/g."
