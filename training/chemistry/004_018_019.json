    "message_1": "A 5 g sample of a mixture containing sand and salt is dissolved in water. The solution is filtered, and the sand is collected and dried. The dried sand has a mass of 3 g. Using mass balance calculations, determine the percentage of salt in the original mixture.",
    "message_2": "To determine the percentage of salt in the original mixture, we can use mass balance calculations. The mass of the original mixture is 5 g, and the mass of the sand is 3 g. Therefore, the mass of the salt can be calculated as follows:\n\nMass of salt = Mass of original mixture - Mass of sand\nMass of salt = 5 g - 3 g\nMass of salt = 2 g\n\nNow, we can calculate the percentage of salt in the original mixture:\n\nPercentage of salt = (Mass of salt / Mass of original mixture) * 100\nPercentage of salt = (2 g / 5 g) * 100\nPercentage of salt = 0.4 * 100\nPercentage of salt = 40%\n\nThus, the percentage of salt in the original mixture is 40%."
