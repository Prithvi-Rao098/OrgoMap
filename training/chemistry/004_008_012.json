    "message_2": "As the unknown compound is not provided, I cannot specifically identify the functional groups present in it. However, I can guide you on how to identify functional groups using infrared (IR) spectroscopy.\n\nInfrared spectroscopy is a technique used to identify functional groups in a compound by analyzing the absorption of infrared light by the molecule. Different functional groups have characteristic absorption bands in the IR spectrum, which can be used to identify them. Here are some common functional groups and their characteristic IR absorption bands:\n\n1. Alcohols and Phenols: Broad absorption band around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹ due to O-H stretching.\n\n2. Carboxylic Acids: Broad absorption band around 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ due to O-H stretching, and a sharp band around 1700-1720 cm⁻¹ due to C=O stretching.\n\n3. Amines: Absorption bands around 3300-3500 cm⁻¹ (primary amines show two bands, while secondary amines show one) due to N-H stretching.\n\n4. Aldehydes: Absorption band around 2700-2900 cm⁻¹ due to C-H stretching in the aldehyde group, and a strong band around 1700-1720 cm⁻¹ due to C=O stretching.\n\n5. Ketones and Esters: Strong absorption band around 1700-1720 cm⁻¹ due to C=O stretching.\n\n6. Amides: Absorption bands around 3300-3500 cm⁻¹ due to N-H stretching (primary amides show two bands, while secondary amides show one), and a strong band around 1630-1690 cm⁻¹ due to C=O stretching.\n\n7. Nitriles: Absorption band around 2210-2260 cm⁻¹ due to C≡N stretching.\n\n8. Alkenes: Absorption bands around 3000-3100 cm⁻¹ due to C-H stretching in the alkene group, and a band around 1600-1680 cm⁻¹ due to C=C stretching.\n\n9. Alkynes: Absorption bands around 3300 cm⁻¹ due to C-H stretching in the alkyne group, and a band around 2100-2260 cm⁻¹ due to C≡C stretching.\n\n10. Aromatic Compounds: Absorption bands around 3000-3100 cm⁻¹ due to C-H stretching in the aromatic ring, and multiple bands between 1400-1600 cm⁻¹ due to C=C stretching in the aromatic ring.\n\nTo identify the functional groups in an unknown compound, obtain its IR spectrum and look for the characteristic absorption bands mentioned above. Compare the observed bands with the known bands for each functional group to determine which groups are present in the compound."
