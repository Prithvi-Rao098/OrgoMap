    "message_2": "To calculate the vibrational frequency of HCl in its ground state, we can use the following formula:\n\nv = (1/2π) * √(k/μ)\n\nwhere v is the vibrational frequency, k is the force constant, and μ is the reduced mass of the HCl molecule.\n\nFirst, we need to find the reduced mass (μ) of the HCl molecule. The reduced mass is given by the formula:\n\nμ = (m1 * m2) / (m1 + m2)\n\nwhere m1 and m2 are the masses of the hydrogen and chlorine atoms, respectively. The atomic mass of hydrogen is approximately 1 amu, and the atomic mass of chlorine is approximately 35.5 amu. Converting these values to kilograms (1 amu = 1.66 x 10^-27 kg), we get:\n\nm1 = 1.66 x 10^-27 kg\nm2 = 35.5 * 1.66 x 10^-27 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the reduced mass:\n\nμ = (1.66 x 10^-27 kg * 35.5 * 1.66 x 10^-27 kg) / (1.66 x 10^-27 kg + 35.5 * 1.66 x 10^-27 kg)\nμ ≈ 1.626 x 10^-27 kg\n\nNext, we need to find the force constant (k) for the HCl molecule. The force constant can be experimentally determined or found in literature. For HCl, the force constant is approximately 480 N/m.\n\nNow we can calculate the vibrational frequency (v):\n\nv = (1/2π) * √(480 N/m / 1.626 x 10^-27 kg)\nv ≈ 8.57 x 10^13 Hz\n\nSo, the vibrational frequency of HCl in its ground state is approximately 8.57 x 10^13 Hz."
