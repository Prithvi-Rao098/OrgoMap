    "message_2": "To determine the amount of phenol and nitric acid needed to prepare 10 grams of 2,4-dinitrophenol, we need to consider the stoichiometry of the reaction and the molecular weights of the reactants and product.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the nitration of phenol to form 2,4-dinitrophenol is:\n\nC6H5OH (phenol) + 2 HNO3 (nitric acid) → C6H3(NO2)2OH (2,4-dinitrophenol) + 2 H2O (water)\n\nNow, we need to calculate the molecular weights of phenol, nitric acid, and 2,4-dinitrophenol:\n\nPhenol (C6H5OH): (6 × 12.01) + (6 × 1.01) + 16.00 = 94.11 g/mol\nNitric acid (HNO3): 1.01 + 14.01 + (3 × 16.00) = 63.01 g/mol\n2,4-Dinitrophenol (C6H3(NO2)2OH): (6 × 12.01) + (3 × 1.01) + (2 × 14.01) + (4 × 16.00) + 16.00 = 184.11 g/mol\n\nWe are given that we want to prepare 10 grams of 2,4-dinitrophenol. To find the moles of 2,4-dinitrophenol, we can use the formula:\n\nmoles = mass / molecular weight\n\nmoles of 2,4-dinitrophenol = 10 g / 184.11 g/mol = 0.0543 mol\n\nFrom the balanced chemical equation, we can see that 1 mole of phenol reacts with 2 moles of nitric acid to produce 1 mole of 2,4-dinitrophenol. Therefore, we need 0.0543 moles of phenol and 2 × 0.0543 = 0.1086 moles of nitric acid.\n\nNow, we can calculate the mass of phenol and nitric acid needed:\n\nmass of phenol = moles × molecular weight = 0.0543 mol × 94.11 g/mol = 5.11 g\nmass of nitric acid = moles × molecular weight = 0.1086 mol × 63.01 g/mol = 6.84 g\n\nSo, to prepare 10 grams of 2,4-dinitrophenol, you will need approximately 5.11 grams of phenol and 6.84 grams of nitric acid."
