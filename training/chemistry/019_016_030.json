    "message_2": "The standard enthalpy change for the vaporization of water at its boiling point (100°C) and standard pressure (1 atm) is 40.7 kJ/mol. To calculate the enthalpy change for 50 grams of water, we need to convert grams to moles and then multiply by the enthalpy change per mole.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of water:\n50 grams / (18.015 g/mol) = 2.775 moles of water\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change:\n2.775 moles * 40.7 kJ/mol = 112.94 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the vaporization of 50 grams of water at its boiling point (100°C) and standard pressure (1 atm) is approximately 112.94 kJ."
