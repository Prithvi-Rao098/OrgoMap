    "message_2": "Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are hormone-like substances that play a key role in generating pain, inflammation, and fever in the body.\n\nProstaglandins are produced by the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX). There are two main types of COX enzymes: COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 is responsible for maintaining the normal lining of the stomach and supporting platelet function, while COX-2 is primarily involved in the production of prostaglandins in response to inflammation or injury.\n\nIbuprofen works by blocking both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, which in turn reduces the production of prostaglandins. As a result, it helps to alleviate pain, inflammation, and fever. However, since it also inhibits COX-1, it can cause side effects such as gastrointestinal irritation and bleeding in some individuals.\n\nIn summary, ibuprofen alleviates pain and inflammation in the body by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins through the blockade of COX enzymes. This leads to a reduction in pain, inflammation, and fever, providing relief for various conditions such as headaches, muscle aches, arthritis, and menstrual cramps."
