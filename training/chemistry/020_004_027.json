    "message_1": "How does the presence of a catalyst affect the equilibrium position of a chemical reaction and what is its impact on the reaction rate? Provide an example of a chemical equation and calculate the equilibrium constant (Kc) before and after the addition of a catalyst. Also, determine the percentage change in the equilibrium constant and explain the reason for the observed change.",
    "message_2": "The presence of a catalyst in a chemical reaction does not affect the equilibrium position of the reaction. However, it does impact the reaction rate by lowering the activation energy required for the reaction to proceed. This results in an increase in the rate at which the reaction reaches equilibrium, but the final equilibrium concentrations of reactants and products remain unchanged.\n\nLet's consider the following example of a chemical reaction:\n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g)\n\nSuppose the equilibrium constant (Kc) for this reaction is 0.5 at a certain temperature. This means that at equilibrium, the ratio of the concentrations of products to reactants is 0.5.\n\nNow, let's say we add a catalyst to the reaction. The catalyst will increase the reaction rate, allowing the reaction to reach equilibrium faster. However, the equilibrium constant (Kc) will remain the same (0.5) even after the addition of the catalyst. This is because the catalyst does not change the thermodynamics of the reaction, only the kinetics.\n\nTo determine the percentage change in the equilibrium constant, we can use the following formula:\n\nPercentage change in Kc = [(Kc after catalyst - Kc before catalyst) / Kc before catalyst] × 100\n\nIn this case, the Kc before and after the addition of the catalyst is the same (0.5), so the percentage change in Kc is:\n\nPercentage change in Kc = [(0.5 - 0.5) / 0.5] × 100 = 0%\n\nThe reason for the observed change (or lack thereof) in the equilibrium constant is that the catalyst only affects the reaction rate, not the equilibrium position. The catalyst lowers the activation energy required for the reaction to proceed, allowing the reaction to reach equilibrium faster, but it does not change the final equilibrium concentrations of reactants and products."
