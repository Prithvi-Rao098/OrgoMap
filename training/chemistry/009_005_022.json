    "message_2": "To calculate the binding energy per nucleon, we simply need to divide the total binding energy by the number of nucleons (protons and neutrons) in the nucleus.\n\nGiven:\nTotal mass of the nucleus = 24 atomic mass units (amu)\nTotal binding energy = 200 MeV\n\nSince the mass of the nucleus is given in atomic mass units, we can assume that there are 24 nucleons (protons and neutrons) in the nucleus.\n\nNow, we can calculate the binding energy per nucleon:\n\nBinding energy per nucleon = Total binding energy / Number of nucleons\nBinding energy per nucleon = 200 MeV / 24 nucleons\n\nBinding energy per nucleon = 8.333 MeV/nucleon\n\nSo, the binding energy per nucleon for this nucleus is approximately 8.333 MeV/nucleon."
