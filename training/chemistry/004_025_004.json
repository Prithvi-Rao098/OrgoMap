    "message_2": "To determine the concentration of an unknown metal ion in a sample solution using voltammetry, follow these steps:\n\n1. Prepare the sample solution: First, ensure that the sample solution is properly prepared. This may involve filtering, diluting, or adjusting the pH to optimize the conditions for the voltammetric analysis.\n\n2. Choose the appropriate electrode: Select a suitable working electrode, such as a glassy carbon, platinum, or gold electrode, depending on the metal ion of interest and the type of voltammetry technique to be used.\n\n3. Set up the electrochemical cell: Assemble the electrochemical cell, which typically consists of a working electrode, a reference electrode (e.g., Ag/AgCl or saturated calomel electrode), and a counter electrode (e.g., platinum wire). Connect these electrodes to a potentiostat, which will control the applied potential and measure the current response.\n\n4. Perform a voltammetric scan: Carry out a voltammetric scan by applying a potential sweep to the working electrode while monitoring the current response. The potential is varied linearly with time, and the resulting current-potential curve (voltammogram) will show peaks corresponding to the reduction or oxidation of the metal ion.\n\n5. Identify the metal ion: Analyze the voltammogram to identify the unknown metal ion based on the characteristic peak potential. Compare the peak potential with known standard values or perform additional experiments with known metal ions to confirm the identity of the unknown ion.\n\n6. Calibration curve: Prepare a series of standard solutions containing known concentrations of the identified metal ion. Perform voltammetric scans for each standard solution and plot the peak current as a function of the metal ion concentration. This will generate a calibration curve.\n\n7. Determine the concentration: Measure the peak current for the unknown metal ion in the sample solution and use the calibration curve to determine its concentration. Ensure that the peak current falls within the linear range of the calibration curve for accurate quantification.\n\n8. Validate the results: Perform additional experiments, such as replicate measurements or recovery studies, to validate the accuracy and precision of the voltammetric determination.\n\nBy following these steps, the concentration of an unknown metal ion in a sample solution can be determined using voltammetry."
