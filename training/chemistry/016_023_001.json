    "message_2": "To determine the enthalpy change of the hydrolysis of acetic anhydride, we need to first find the balanced chemical equation for the reaction. The reaction is as follows:\n\n(CH3CO)2O + H2O â†’ CH3COOH + CH3COOH\n\nNow, we need to find the moles of acetic anhydride, acetic acid, and the other product (which is also acetic acid in this case) involved in the reaction.\n\nThe molar mass of acetic anhydride (C4H6O3) is:\n(4 * 12.01) + (6 * 1.01) + (3 * 16.00) = 102.09 g/mol\n\nThe molar mass of acetic acid (C2H4O2) is:\n(2 * 12.01) + (4 * 1.01) + (2 * 16.00) = 60.05 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the moles of each substance:\n\nMoles of acetic anhydride = 5 g / 102.09 g/mol = 0.0489 mol\nMoles of acetic acid = 2.2 g / 60.05 g/mol = 0.0366 mol\n\nSince the balanced equation shows that 1 mole of acetic anhydride reacts to produce 2 moles of acetic acid, we can find the moles of acetic acid produced from the reaction:\n\nMoles of acetic acid produced = 0.0489 mol * 2 = 0.0978 mol\n\nNow, we can find the enthalpy change of the reaction using the heat of combustion of acetic acid:\n\nEnthalpy change = moles of acetic acid produced * heat of combustion of acetic acid\nEnthalpy change = 0.0978 mol * -871 kJ/mol = -85.2 kJ\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy change of the hydrolysis of acetic anhydride is -85.2 kJ."
