    "message_2": "Sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is a strong acid, which means it dissociates completely in water. The balanced equation for the dissociation of H2SO4 is:\n\nH2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-\n\nIn a 0.1M solution of sulfuric acid, the concentration of H2SO4 is 0.1 moles per liter. Since each molecule of H2SO4 dissociates into 2 moles of H+ ions, the concentration of H+ ions in the solution will be:\n\n[ H+ ] = 2 * [ H2SO4 ] = 2 * 0.1M = 0.2M\n\nNow, we can calculate the pH of the solution using the formula:\n\npH = -log10([H+])\n\npH = -log10(0.2)\n\npH ≈ 0.7\n\nSo, the pH of a 0.1M solution of sulfuric acid is approximately 0.7, which indicates that it is a highly acidic solution."
