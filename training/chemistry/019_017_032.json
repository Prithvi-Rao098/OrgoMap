    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the sublimation of iodine, we need to consider the enthalpy changes for both fusion and vaporization. Sublimation is the process of a solid turning directly into a gas, bypassing the liquid phase. In this case, iodine (I2) will first undergo fusion (melting) and then vaporization (boiling).\n\nThe enthalpy change for sublimation (ΔH_sub) can be calculated by adding the enthalpy of fusion (ΔH_fus) and the enthalpy of vaporization (ΔH_vap):\n\nΔH_sub = ΔH_fus + ΔH_vap\n\nGiven the enthalpy of fusion for iodine is 15.52 kJ/mol and the enthalpy of vaporization for iodine is 41.57 kJ/mol, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔH_sub = 15.52 kJ/mol + 41.57 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_sub = 57.09 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the sublimation of iodine (I2) is 57.09 kJ/mol."
