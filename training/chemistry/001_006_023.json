    "message_2": "To differentiate between alkenes and alkynes using chemical tests, you can perform the following step-wise procedure:\n\n1. Bromine water test (for unsaturation): \nAdd a few drops of bromine water to the unknown organic compound. If the bromine water loses its color (reddish-brown to colorless), it indicates the presence of unsaturation (either an alkene or alkyne) in the compound.\n\n2. Baeyer's test (for unsaturation): \nIf bromine water is not available, you can perform Baeyer's test. Add a few drops of an alkaline potassium permanganate (KMnO4) solution to the unknown organic compound. If the purple color of the KMnO4 solution disappears, it indicates the presence of unsaturation (either an alkene or alkyne) in the compound.\n\nIf the compound does not show any reaction in the above tests, it is likely an alkane, and further testing for alkenes or alkynes is not necessary.\n\nIf unsaturation is confirmed, proceed to the following tests to differentiate between alkenes and alkynes:\n\n3. Tollen's reagent test (for terminal alkynes): \nPrepare Tollen's reagent by mixing equal volumes of 0.1 M silver nitrate (AgNO3) and 0.1 M ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH). Add a few drops of the reagent to the unknown organic compound and gently heat the mixture. If a silver mirror forms on the inner surface of the test tube, it indicates the presence of a terminal alkyne (alkynes with a triple bond at the end of the carbon chain). If no silver mirror forms, proceed to the next test.\n\n4. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) and potassium permanganate (KMnO4) test (for alkenes): \nAdd a few drops of concentrated HCl to the unknown organic compound, followed by a few drops of 0.1 M KMnO4 solution. If the purple color of the KMnO4 solution disappears and a brown precipitate forms, it indicates the presence of an alkene.\n\nBased on the results of these tests, you can confirm the presence of either alkenes or alkynes in the unknown organic compound."
