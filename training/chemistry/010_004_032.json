    "message_2": "To find the cell potential for the reaction, we need to determine which half-reaction will act as the anode (oxidation) and which will act as the cathode (reduction). The half-reaction with the lower standard reduction potential will act as the anode, and the half-reaction with the higher standard reduction potential will act as the cathode.\n\nIn this case, the Cu²⁺/Cu half-reaction has a lower standard reduction potential (E° = +0.34 V) compared to the Ag⁺/Ag half-reaction (E° = +0.80 V). Therefore, the Cu²⁺/Cu half-reaction will act as the anode (oxidation) and the Ag⁺/Ag half-reaction will act as the cathode (reduction).\n\nNow, we need to reverse the anode half-reaction to represent oxidation:\n\nCu (s) → Cu²⁺ (aq) + 2e⁻\n\nThe cell potential (E°cell) can be calculated by subtracting the standard reduction potential of the anode (E°anode) from the standard reduction potential of the cathode (E°cathode):\n\nE°cell = E°cathode - E°anode\n\nE°cell = (+0.80 V) - (+0.34 V)\n\nE°cell = +0.46 V\n\nThe cell potential for the reaction when a copper electrode is paired with a silver electrode in a standard electrochemical cell is +0.46 V."
