    "message_2": "For a molecule with one chiral carbon, there can be two possible stereoisomers: one with the R configuration and one with the S configuration. Here are the possible structures for a molecule with the molecular formula C5H10O containing one chiral carbon:\n\n1. 2-pentanol:\n   Chiral carbon is at position 2.\n   R-2-pentanol: H-C(=O)-C(R)-C-C-C\n   S-2-pentanol: H-C(=O)-C(S)-C-C-C\n\n2. 3-methyl-2-butanol:\n   Chiral carbon is at position 3.\n   R-3-methyl-2-butanol: H-C(=O)-C-C(R)-C-C\n   S-3-methyl-2-butanol: H-C(=O)-C-C(S)-C-C\n\nIn total, there are four possible stereoisomers for a molecule with the molecular formula C5H10O that contains one chiral carbon."
