    "message_2": "The addition of a catalyst to a reaction does not affect the equilibrium position of the reaction. Catalysts work by lowering the activation energy of a reaction, which increases the rate at which the reaction proceeds. However, catalysts do not change the thermodynamics of the reaction, meaning that the equilibrium constant (K) remains the same.\n\nIn the redox reaction between iron(III) ions and iodide ions in aqueous solution, the addition of a catalyst would increase the rate at which the reaction reaches equilibrium, but it would not change the equilibrium position itself. The concentrations of the reactants and products at equilibrium would remain the same with or without the catalyst."
