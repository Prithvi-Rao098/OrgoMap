    "message_2": "To calculate the number of electrons transferred during the electrochemical reaction, we need to look at the oxidation states of the elements involved in the reaction.\n\nIn the given reaction:\n\nMg(s) + 2H+(aq) → Mg2+(aq) + H2(g)\n\n1. Magnesium (Mg) is in its elemental form with an oxidation state of 0.\n2. Hydrogen ions (H+) have an oxidation state of +1.\n3. Magnesium ions (Mg2+) have an oxidation state of +2.\n4. Hydrogen gas (H2) is in its elemental form with an oxidation state of 0.\n\nNow, let's identify the oxidation and reduction processes:\n\nOxidation: Mg(s) → Mg2+(aq) + 2e-\nIn this process, magnesium loses 2 electrons and its oxidation state changes from 0 to +2.\n\nReduction: 2H+(aq) + 2e- → H2(g)\nIn this process, two hydrogen ions gain 2 electrons in total and their oxidation state changes from +1 to 0.\n\nSince the number of electrons lost in the oxidation process is equal to the number of electrons gained in the reduction process, the number of electrons transferred during the electrochemical reaction is 2."
