    "message_2": "The balanced chemical equation for the preparation of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene from nitrobenzene and chlorine gas is:\n\nC6H5NO2 + 2 Cl2 → C6H3Cl2NO2 + 2 HCl\n\nTo calculate the theoretical yield of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene, we first need to determine the number of moles of nitrobenzene. The molecular weight of nitrobenzene (C6H5NO2) is:\n\n(6 × 12.01) + (5 × 1.01) + (14.01) + (2 × 16.00) = 123.11 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the number of moles of nitrobenzene:\n\nmoles of nitrobenzene = mass / molecular weight\nmoles of nitrobenzene = 10 g / 123.11 g/mol = 0.0812 mol\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1 between nitrobenzene and 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene, the number of moles of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene produced is also 0.0812 mol.\n\nThe molecular weight of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene (C6H3Cl2NO2) is:\n\n(6 × 12.01) + (3 × 1.01) + (2 × 35.45) + (14.01) + (2 × 16.00) = 176.02 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the theoretical yield of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene:\n\ntheoretical yield = moles × molecular weight\ntheoretical yield = 0.0812 mol × 176.02 g/mol = 14.29 g\n\nHowever, the reaction has a 90% yield, so we need to account for this:\n\nactual yield = theoretical yield × percentage yield\nactual yield = 14.29 g × 0.90 = 12.86 g\n\nTherefore, the theoretical yield of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene when 10 grams of nitrobenzene reacts with excess chlorine gas with a 90% yield is 12.86 grams."
