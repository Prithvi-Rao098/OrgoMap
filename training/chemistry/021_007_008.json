    "message_2": "To calculate the formal charge of the nitrogen atom in NO₂, we can use the following formula:\n\nFormal charge = (Valence electrons of the atom) - (Non-bonding electrons) - 0.5 * (Bonding electrons)\n\nIn the case of nitrogen, the number of valence electrons is 5. In the NO₂ molecule, nitrogen forms two bonds with oxygen atoms: one single bond and one double bond. This means there are 2 (from the single bond) + 4 (from the double bond) = 6 bonding electrons.\n\nThere are no non-bonding electrons on the nitrogen atom in NO₂, as all its valence electrons are involved in bonding.\n\nNow, we can calculate the formal charge:\n\nFormal charge = 5 (valence electrons) - 0 (non-bonding electrons) - 0.5 * 6 (bonding electrons)\nFormal charge = 5 - 0 - 3\nFormal charge = +2\n\nSo, the formal charge of the nitrogen atom in the NO₂ molecule is +2."
