    "message_1": "What is the energy (in MeV) of a gamma ray emitted from a nucleus that undergoes a gamma decay and transitions from an excited state to the ground state, when the wavelength (λ) of the gamma ray is measured to be 0.0812 nm? (Hint: Use the formula E = hc/λ, where h is the Planck's constant and c is the speed of light.)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the energy of the gamma ray, we can use the formula E = hc/λ, where E is the energy, h is the Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.\n\nThe Planck's constant (h) is 6.626 x 10^-34 Js, and the speed of light (c) is 3 x 10^8 m/s. The wavelength (λ) is given as 0.0812 nm, which is equal to 0.0812 x 10^-9 m.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nE = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) x (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (0.0812 x 10^-9 m)\n\nE = 2.453 x 10^-25 J\n\nTo convert the energy from joules to MeV (mega-electron volts), we can use the conversion factor 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J. Therefore, 1 MeV = 1.602 x 10^-13 J.\n\nE (in MeV) = (2.453 x 10^-25 J) / (1.602 x 10^-13 J/MeV)\n\nE (in MeV) ≈ 0.0153 MeV\n\nSo, the energy of the gamma ray is approximately 0.0153 MeV."
