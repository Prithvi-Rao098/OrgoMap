    "message_2": "Copper sulfate (CuSO4) exhibits both ionic and covalent bonding. The bonding between the copper (Cu) cation and the sulfate (SO4) anion is ionic, while the bonding within the sulfate anion itself is covalent.\n\nIonic bonding occurs between a metal and a non-metal, where electrons are transferred from the metal to the non-metal. In CuSO4, copper (Cu) is a metal that loses two electrons to form a Cu2+ cation, while the sulfate (SO4) is a polyatomic anion formed by the combination of sulfur (S) and oxygen (O) atoms. The electrostatic attraction between the Cu2+ cation and the SO4^2- anion results in the ionic bond.\n\nCovalent bonding, on the other hand, occurs between non-metals, where electrons are shared between the atoms. Within the sulfate anion (SO4^2-), sulfur (S) is covalently bonded to four oxygen (O) atoms through the sharing of electrons. This forms a tetrahedral structure with covalent bonds between the sulfur and oxygen atoms.\n\nIn summary, copper sulfate (CuSO4) exhibits both ionic bonding (between the Cu2+ cation and the SO4^2- anion) and covalent bonding (within the sulfate anion itself)."
