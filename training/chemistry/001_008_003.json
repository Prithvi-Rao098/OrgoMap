    "message_2": "Alcohols and phenols are both organic compounds containing hydroxyl (-OH) functional groups. However, they differ in terms of their molecular structure and reactivity.\n\n1. Functional groups:\n- Alcohols: In alcohols, the hydroxyl group is bonded to an aliphatic carbon atom (sp3 hybridized carbon). Alcohols can be classified as primary (1°), secondary (2°), or tertiary (3°) depending on the number of carbon atoms bonded to the carbon atom attached to the hydroxyl group. The general formula for alcohols is R-OH, where R represents an alkyl group.\n\nExample: Methanol (CH3OH), Ethanol (C2H5OH)\n\n- Phenols: In phenols, the hydroxyl group is bonded to an aromatic carbon atom (sp2 hybridized carbon) in a benzene ring. The general formula for phenols is Ar-OH, where Ar represents an aryl group.\n\nExample: Phenol (C6H5OH), Cresol (CH3-C6H4OH)\n\n2. Reactivity:\n- Alcohols: Alcohols are generally less acidic than phenols due to the electron-donating nature of the alkyl group. They can undergo reactions such as dehydration, oxidation, and substitution. The reactivity of alcohols depends on the type (primary, secondary, or tertiary) and the presence of any other functional groups in the molecule.\n\n- Phenols: Phenols are more acidic than alcohols because the aromatic ring stabilizes the negative charge on the oxygen atom after losing a proton. Phenols can undergo electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions, such as nitration, halogenation, and sulfonation, due to the electron-donating nature of the hydroxyl group. They can also undergo oxidation reactions.\n\n3. Industrial uses:\n- Alcohols:\n  - Methanol: Used as a solvent, antifreeze, and fuel, as well as a feedstock for producing formaldehyde and other chemicals.\n  - Ethanol: Used as a solvent, fuel (gasoline additive), and in the production of alcoholic beverages. It is also used as a feedstock for producing ethylene and other chemicals.\n\n- Phenols:\n  - Phenol: Used as a precursor for producing plastics (e.g., polycarbonate, epoxy resins), pharmaceuticals, and other chemicals. It is also used as a disinfectant.\n  - Cresol: Used as a disinfectant, solvent, and in the production of antioxidants, resins, and other chemicals."
