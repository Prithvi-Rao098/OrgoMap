    "message_2": "Greenhouse gases contribute to global warming by trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere. They absorb and re-emit infrared radiation, which increases the overall temperature of the planet. The primary greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and fluorinated gases. Their relative influence on the Earth's atmosphere can be measured using their Global Warming Potential (GWP), which is a measure of how much heat a greenhouse gas traps in the atmosphere compared to carbon dioxide over a specific time period (usually 100 years).\n\n1. Carbon dioxide (CO2): CO2 is the most significant greenhouse gas, primarily released through the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and various industrial processes. It has a GWP of 1, which serves as the baseline for comparing other greenhouse gases. CO2 is responsible for approximately 76% of global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n2. Methane (CH4): Methane is released during the production and transport of coal, oil, and natural gas, as well as from livestock and other agricultural practices, and the decay of organic waste in landfills. Methane has a GWP of 28-36, meaning it is 28-36 times more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere than CO2 over a 100-year period. However, methane has a shorter atmospheric lifetime than CO2, breaking down in about 12 years. Methane accounts for approximately 16% of global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n3. Nitrous oxide (N2O): Nitrous oxide is released from agricultural and industrial activities, as well as from burning fossil fuels. It has a GWP of 265-298, making it much more potent than CO2 in terms of heat-trapping capability. However, N2O is less abundant in the atmosphere and accounts for about 6% of global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n4. Fluorinated gases: These are synthetic gases, including hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), which are released from various industrial processes. Although they are less common than the other greenhouse gases, they have much higher GWPs, ranging from 1,000 to over 23,000 times more potent than CO2. Due to their low concentration in the atmosphere, they contribute to less than 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn summary, while CO2 is the most abundant greenhouse gas and has the largest overall impact on global warming, other gases like methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases have a much higher warming potential per unit. Reducing emissions of all these greenhouse gases is crucial for mitigating global warming and its consequences on the Earth's atmosphere and climate."
