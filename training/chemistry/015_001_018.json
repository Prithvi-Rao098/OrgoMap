    "message_2": "To calculate the molecular orbital energies and electron distribution of a water molecule (H2O) using the Hartree-Fock (HF) method, we first need to understand the molecular structure and atomic orbitals involved. Water has an oxygen atom bonded to two hydrogen atoms in a bent structure with a bond angle of approximately 104.5 degrees.\n\nThe oxygen atom has the following electron configuration: 1s² 2s² 2p⁴. The two hydrogen atoms each have an electron configuration of 1s¹. In the water molecule, the oxygen atom forms two sigma bonds with the hydrogen atoms using its 2s and one of the 2p orbitals. The remaining three 2p orbitals on the oxygen atom form two non-bonding orbitals and one pi orbital.\n\nUsing the Hartree-Fock method, we can calculate the molecular orbital energies and electron distribution by solving the Roothaan-Hall equations. However, this process is computationally intensive and requires specialized software to perform the calculations. Here, we will provide a qualitative description of the molecular orbitals and their energies.\n\n1. The lowest energy molecular orbital is the 1a₁ orbital, which is primarily derived from the oxygen 1s orbital. This is a non-bonding orbital and is fully occupied with two electrons.\n\n2. The next higher energy molecular orbitals are the 2a₁ and 1b₂ orbitals. The 2a₁ orbital is a bonding orbital formed by the overlap of the oxygen 2s orbital and the hydrogen 1s orbitals. The 1b₂ orbital is a non-bonding orbital derived from one of the oxygen 2p orbitals. Both of these orbitals are fully occupied with two electrons each.\n\n3. The next higher energy molecular orbitals are the 3a₁ and 1b₁ orbitals. The 3a₁ orbital is a bonding orbital formed by the overlap of one of the oxygen 2p orbitals and the hydrogen 1s orbitals. The 1b₁ orbital is a non-bonding orbital derived from one of the oxygen 2p orbitals. Both of these orbitals are fully occupied with two electrons each.\n\n4. The highest energy molecular orbital is the 2b₂ orbital, which is a pi* anti-bonding orbital derived from the remaining oxygen 2p orbital. This orbital is unoccupied.\n\nBased on this electronic structure, the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) is the 3a₁ orbital, and the LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) is the 2b₂ orbital. The bonding interactions in the water molecule are primarily due to the overlap of the oxygen 2s and 2p orbitals with the hydrogen 1s orbitals, resulting in the formation of the 2a₁ and 3a₁ molecular orbitals. The non-bonding interactions are due to the oxygen 1s, 1b₂, and 1b₁ orbitals, which do not participate in bonding with the hydrogen atoms."
