    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction, we can use the expression:\n\nKc = [N2O4] / [NO2]^2\n\nwhere [N2O4] is the concentration of N2O4 at equilibrium and [NO2] is the concentration of NO2 at equilibrium.\n\nGiven the concentrations of NO2 (0.25 M) and N2O4 (0.10 M), we can plug these values into the expression:\n\nKc = (0.10) / (0.25)^2\n\nKc = 0.10 / 0.0625\n\nKc ≈ 1.6\n\nThe equilibrium constant for the reaction is approximately 1.6."
