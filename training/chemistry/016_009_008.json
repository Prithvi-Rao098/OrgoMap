    "message_2": "To calculate the energy required to vaporize 100 grams of liquid water, we need to first determine the number of moles of water present and then use the enthalpy of vaporization to find the energy.\n\n1. Calculate the number of moles of water:\nThe molar mass of water (H2O) is 18.015 g/mol.\nNumber of moles = mass / molar mass\nNumber of moles = 100 g / 18.015 g/mol = 5.551 moles\n\n2. Calculate the energy required using the enthalpy of vaporization:\nEnergy = number of moles × enthalpy of vaporization\nEnergy = 5.551 moles × 40.7 kJ/mol = 225.93 kJ\n\nTherefore, the amount of energy required to vaporize 100 grams of liquid water at its boiling point is approximately 225.93 kJ."
