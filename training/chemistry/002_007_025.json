    "message_2": "The reaction between sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and copper (II) sulfate (CuSO₄) is a double displacement reaction, also known as a metathesis reaction. The products of this reaction are copper (II) hydroxide (Cu(OH)₂) and sodium sulfate (Na₂SO₄). The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\n2 NaOH + CuSO₄ → Cu(OH)₂ + Na₂SO₄"
