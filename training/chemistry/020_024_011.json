    "message_2": "The redox reaction between iodine (I2) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) can be represented as follows:\n\nI2 + 2HCl → 2HI + Cl2\n\nA catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without being consumed in the process. It does so by lowering the activation energy of the reaction. Importantly, a catalyst affects both the forward and reverse reactions equally, so it does not change the equilibrium position of the reaction.\n\nThe equilibrium constant (K) for a reaction at a given temperature is defined as the ratio of the concentrations of the products to the concentrations of the reactants, each raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients:\n\nK = [HI]^2 [Cl2] / ([I2] [HCl]^2)\n\nTo calculate the equilibrium constant at 25°C, we need the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) for the reaction at this temperature. Unfortunately, you have not provided this information. If you have the ΔG° value, you can use the following equation to calculate the equilibrium constant:\n\nK = exp(-ΔG° / (RT))\n\nwhere R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K) and T is the temperature in Kelvin (25°C = 298.15 K).\n\nIn summary, the addition of a catalyst will not affect the equilibrium position of the redox reaction between iodine and hydrochloric acid. It will only increase the rate at which the reaction reaches equilibrium. To determine whether the catalyst will favor the forward or reverse reaction, you need to calculate the equilibrium constant using the standard Gibbs free energy change for the reaction at the given temperature."
