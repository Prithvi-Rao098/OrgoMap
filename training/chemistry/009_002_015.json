    "message_2": "The final product of the decay series of Uranium-238 is stable Lead-206 (Pb-206). The decay chain, also known as the Uranium series or 4n+2 decay chain, consists of several alpha (α) and beta (β) decays. Here is a simplified list of the decay chain, including the radioactive emissions at each step:\n\n1. Uranium-238 (U-238) undergoes α decay to form Thorium-234 (Th-234).\n   Emission: Alpha particle (α)\n\n2. Thorium-234 (Th-234) undergoes β decay to form Protactinium-234 (Pa-234).\n   Emission: Beta particle (β)\n\n3. Protactinium-234 (Pa-234) undergoes β decay to form Uranium-234 (U-234).\n   Emission: Beta particle (β)\n\n4. Uranium-234 (U-234) undergoes α decay to form Thorium-230 (Th-230).\n   Emission: Alpha particle (α)\n\n5. Thorium-230 (Th-230) undergoes α decay to form Radium-226 (Ra-226).\n   Emission: Alpha particle (α)\n\n6. Radium-226 (Ra-226) undergoes α decay to form Radon-222 (Rn-222).\n   Emission: Alpha particle (α)\n\n7. Radon-222 (Rn-222) undergoes α decay to form Polonium-218 (Po-218).\n   Emission: Alpha particle (α)\n\n8. Polonium-218 (Po-218) undergoes α decay to form Lead-214 (Pb-214).\n   Emission: Alpha particle (α)\n\n9. Lead-214 (Pb-214) undergoes β decay to form Bismuth-214 (Bi-214).\n   Emission: Beta particle (β)\n\n10. Bismuth-214 (Bi-214) undergoes β decay to form Polonium-214 (Po-214).\n    Emission: Beta particle (β)\n\n11. Polonium-214 (Po-214) undergoes α decay to form Lead-210 (Pb-210).\n    Emission: Alpha particle (α)\n\n12. Lead-210 (Pb-210) undergoes β decay to form Bismuth-210 (Bi-210).\n    Emission: Beta particle (β)\n\n13. Bismuth-210 (Bi-210) undergoes β decay to form Polonium-210 (Po-210).\n    Emission: Beta particle (β)\n\n14. Polonium-210 (Po-210) undergoes α decay to form stable Lead-206 (Pb-206).\n    Emission: Alpha particle (α)\n\nIn summary, the decay chain of Uranium-238 involves 8 alpha decays and 6 beta decays, ultimately resulting in the stable isotope Lead-206."
