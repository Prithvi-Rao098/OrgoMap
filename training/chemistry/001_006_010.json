    "message_2": "The hydration reaction of propyne (also known as prop-1-yne or methylacetylene) involves the addition of water (H₂O) across the triple bond of the alkyne to form an alcohol. The reaction mechanism proceeds through the following steps:\n\n1. Acid-catalyzed hydration: The reaction is typically carried out in the presence of an acid catalyst, such as sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) or phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄), which protonates the alkyne to form a resonance-stabilized carbocation.\n\nPropyne + H⁺ → Resonance-stabilized carbocation\n\n2. Nucleophilic attack: The oxygen atom of a water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbocation, forming a bond with the positively charged carbon atom.\n\nResonance-stabilized carbocation + H₂O → Oxonium ion intermediate\n\n3. Deprotonation: Another water molecule acts as a base and deprotonates the oxonium ion intermediate, resulting in the formation of an enol.\n\nOxonium ion intermediate + H₂O → Enol + H₃O⁺\n\n4. Tautomerization: The enol undergoes keto-enol tautomerization, which is an equilibrium process that involves the migration of a hydrogen atom and a double bond. This results in the formation of a ketone as the major product.\n\nEnol ⇌ Ketone\n\nSo, the overall reaction is:\n\nPropyne + H₂O (in the presence of an acid catalyst) → 2-propanone (acetone)\n\nThe product formed in the hydration reaction of propyne is 2-propanone, also known as acetone, which is a common solvent and the simplest ketone."
