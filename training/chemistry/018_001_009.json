    "message_1": "What is the rate law expression for the reaction between iodine and propanone, if the experimental data suggests that the reaction follows the rate equation: Rate = k[I2]^2[CH3COCH3]? Determine the numerical value of the rate constant (k) by analyzing the data obtained from experiments.",
    "message_2": "The rate law expression for the reaction between iodine and propanone is already given as:\n\nRate = k[I2]^2[CH3COCH3]\n\nTo determine the numerical value of the rate constant (k), you need to provide the experimental data obtained from the experiments. This data should include the concentrations of the reactants and the corresponding reaction rates. Once you provide the data, I can help you calculate the value of k."
