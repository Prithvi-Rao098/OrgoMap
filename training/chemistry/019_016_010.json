    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the vaporization of 50 grams of water, we first need to determine the number of moles of water present. The molar mass of water (H2O) is 18.015 g/mol.\n\nNumber of moles = mass / molar mass\nNumber of moles = 50 g / 18.015 g/mol = 2.775 moles\n\nNow, we can use the molar enthalpy of vaporization to calculate the standard enthalpy change.\n\nStandard enthalpy change = number of moles × molar enthalpy of vaporization\nStandard enthalpy change = 2.775 moles × 40.7 kJ/mol = 112.9415 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the vaporization of 50 grams of water at 100°C and 1 atm pressure is approximately 112.94 kJ."
