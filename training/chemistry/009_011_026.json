    "message_2": "To determine the age of a fossil based on its remaining carbon-14 content, we can use the formula:\n\nAge = (t1/2 / ln(2)) * ln(N0/N)\n\nwhere:\n- Age is the age of the fossil\n- t1/2 is the half-life of carbon-14 (5,730 years)\n- ln is the natural logarithm\n- N0 is the original amount of carbon-14\n- N is the remaining amount of carbon-14\n\nIn this case, the fossil has decayed to 75% of its original carbon-14 content, so N = 0.75 * N0.\n\nAge = (5730 / ln(2)) * ln(N0 / (0.75 * N0))\n\nWe can simplify this expression by canceling out N0:\n\nAge = (5730 / ln(2)) * ln(1 / 0.75)\n\nNow we can plug in the values and solve for the age:\n\nAge = (5730 / ln(2)) * ln(1 / 0.75)\nAge ≈ (5730 / 0.693) * ln(1.333)\nAge ≈ 8267 * 0.287\nAge ≈ 2370 years\n\nSo, the age of the fossil is approximately 2370 years old."
