    "message_2": "To calculate the total amount of heat absorbed, we need to consider three steps:\n\n1. Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C\n2. Melting the ice at 0°C\n3. Heating the water from 0°C to 30°C\n\nStep 1: Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C\nq1 = mass x specific heat of ice x ΔT\nq1 = 20 g x 2.09 J/g°C x (0 - (-10))°C\nq1 = 20 g x 2.09 J/g°C x 10°C\nq1 = 418 J\n\nStep 2: Melting the ice at 0°C\nFirst, we need to find the moles of ice:\nMolar mass of water (H2O) = 18.015 g/mol\nmoles of ice = mass / molar mass\nmoles of ice = 20 g / 18.015 g/mol\nmoles of ice = 1.11 mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat absorbed during melting:\nq2 = moles x enthalpy of fusion\nq2 = 1.11 mol x 6.01 kJ/mol\nq2 = 6.67 kJ\nConvert kJ to J:\nq2 = 6.67 kJ x 1000 J/kJ\nq2 = 6670 J\n\nStep 3: Heating the water from 0°C to 30°C\nq3 = mass x specific heat of water x ΔT\nq3 = 20 g x 4.18 J/g°C x (30 - 0)°C\nq3 = 20 g x 4.18 J/g°C x 30°C\nq3 = 2512 J\n\nNow, we can find the total heat absorbed by adding the heat absorbed in each step:\nq_total = q1 + q2 + q3\nq_total = 418 J + 6670 J + 2512 J\nq_total = 9600 J\n\nSo, the total amount of heat absorbed is 9600 J."
