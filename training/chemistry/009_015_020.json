    "message_2": "To determine the concentration of gold (in ppm) in a soil sample using neutron activation analysis (NAA), you would need to follow these general steps:\n\n1. Collect a representative soil sample and record its mass.\n2. Irradiate the soil sample with neutrons in a nuclear reactor, which will cause the gold atoms to become radioactive.\n3. Allow the irradiated sample to decay for a specific period of time, which will allow the radioactive gold isotopes to emit gamma rays.\n4. Measure the gamma-ray spectrum of the decayed sample using a gamma-ray spectrometer.\n5. Identify the gamma-ray peaks corresponding to the radioactive gold isotopes (e.g., 198Au, 199Au) and determine their intensities.\n6. Compare the measured intensities to those of known standards to determine the concentration of gold in the soil sample.\n\nHowever, without specific data on the mass of the soil sample, the irradiation conditions, the decay time, and the gamma-ray spectrum, it is not possible to provide a numerical value for the concentration of gold in ppm."
