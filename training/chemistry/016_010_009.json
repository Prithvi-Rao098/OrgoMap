    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change, we first need to determine the number of moles of potassium chloride (KCl) being dissolved. \n\n1. Calculate the moles of KCl:\nMolar mass of KCl = 39.10 g/mol (for K) + 35.45 g/mol (for Cl) = 74.55 g/mol\n\nGiven mass of KCl = 25.0 g\n\nNumber of moles = (mass) / (molar mass)\nNumber of moles = 25.0 g / 74.55 g/mol = 0.335 moles of KCl\n\n2. Calculate the enthalpy change:\nEnthalpy of solution of KCl = -56.7 kJ/mol\n\nEnthalpy change = (number of moles) × (enthalpy of solution)\nEnthalpy change = 0.335 moles × -56.7 kJ/mol = -18.99 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change when 25.0 g of potassium chloride is dissolved in 250 mL of water at 25°C is approximately -18.99 kJ."
