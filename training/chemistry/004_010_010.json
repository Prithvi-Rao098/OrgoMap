    "message_1": "A chemistry student wants to determine the concentration of a solution containing iron (III) ions. Using colorimetry, they measure the absorbance of the solution at a specific wavelength and plot a calibration curve with solutions of known iron (III) ion concentration. The student then measures the absorbance of their unknown solution at the same wavelength and uses the calibration curve to determine the concentration of iron (III) ions in the sample. What is the concentration of iron (III) ions in the unknown solution, in units of moles per liter?",
    "message_2": "To determine the concentration of iron (III) ions in the unknown solution, we need the absorbance value of the unknown solution and the calibration curve equation. The calibration curve equation is usually in the form of y = mx + b, where y is the absorbance, x is the concentration, m is the slope, and b is the y-intercept.\n\nPlease provide the absorbance value of the unknown solution and the calibration curve equation."
