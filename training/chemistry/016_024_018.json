The specific heat capacity of the solution is 4.18 J/g °C and the density is 1 g/mL. (Assume the reaction goes to completion and all volumes are additive.)",
    "message_2": "First, let's write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nNa2SO4 (aq) + Ba(NO3)2 (aq) → BaSO4 (s) + 2 NaNO3 (aq)\n\nNow, we need to find the limiting reactant. Since both solutions have the same concentration and volume, the limiting reactant will be the one with the smaller stoichiometric coefficient, which is sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) in this case.\n\nNext, we'll calculate the moles of the limiting reactant:\n\nmoles of Na2SO4 = (0.1 mol/L) * (0.050 L) = 0.005 mol\n\nSince the volumes are additive, the total volume of the solution is:\n\ntotal volume = 50 mL + 50 mL = 100 mL\n\nNow, we'll calculate the mass of the solution using the density:\n\nmass of solution = (100 mL) * (1 g/mL) = 100 g\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat change (q) using the specific heat capacity, mass, and temperature change:\n\nq = (mass of solution) * (specific heat capacity) * (ΔT)\nq = (100 g) * (4.18 J/g °C) * (25°C - 30°C)\nq = 100 g * 4.18 J/g °C * (-5°C)\nq = -2090 J\n\nSince the reaction is exothermic, the heat change will be negative. Now, we can calculate the enthalpy change of precipitation (ΔH) by dividing the heat change by the moles of the limiting reactant:\n\nΔH = q / moles of limiting reactant\nΔH = -2090 J / 0.005 mol\nΔH = -418000 J/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change of precipitation for the reaction between 50 mL of 0.1 M sodium sulfate and 50 mL of 0.1 M barium nitrate is -418 kJ/mol."
