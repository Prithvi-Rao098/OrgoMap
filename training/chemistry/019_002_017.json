    "message_2": "To determine the standard enthalpy of formation for hydrogen chloride gas (HCl(g)), we can use Hess's Law, which states that the total enthalpy change for a reaction is the same, regardless of the pathway taken. We can manipulate the given reactions to create a new reaction that represents the formation of HCl(g) from its constituent elements.\n\nFirst, let's write down the target reaction we want to find the enthalpy change for:\n\n1/2H2(g) + 1/2Cl2(g) → HCl(g)   ΔH = ?\n\nNow, let's manipulate the given reactions to create the target reaction:\n\n1. H2(g) + Cl2(g) → 2HCl(g)    ΔH = -184.6 kJ/mol\nSince we want only 1 mole of HCl(g) in the target reaction, we can divide this reaction by 2:\n\n1/2H2(g) + 1/2Cl2(g) → HCl(g)   ΔH = -92.3 kJ/mol\n\n2. H2(g) + 1/2O2(g) → H2O(l)  ΔH = -285.8 kJ/mol\nWe don't need this reaction for the target reaction, so we can ignore it.\n\n3. 2HCl(g) + O2(g) → 2ClO(g) + H2O(l)   ΔH = -518.2 kJ/mol\nWe need to reverse this reaction and divide it by 2 to get the desired reactants and products:\n\nHCl(g) → 1/2H2(g) + 1/2Cl2(g) + 1/2O2(g) - 1/2H2O(l)   ΔH = 259.1 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can add the manipulated reactions to get the target reaction:\n\n1/2H2(g) + 1/2Cl2(g) → HCl(g)   ΔH = -92.3 kJ/mol\nHCl(g) → 1/2H2(g) + 1/2Cl2(g) + 1/2O2(g) - 1/2H2O(l)   ΔH = 259.1 kJ/mol\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n1/2H2(g) + 1/2Cl2(g) → HCl(g)   ΔH = -92.3 + 259.1 = 166.8 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy of formation for hydrogen chloride gas (HCl(g)) is 166.8 kJ/mol."
