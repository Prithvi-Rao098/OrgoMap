    "message_2": "To calculate the heat required to raise the temperature of the water, we can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere:\nq = heat required (Joules)\nm = mass of the water (grams)\nc = specific heat capacity of water (J/g°C)\nΔT = change in temperature (°C)\n\nGiven:\nm = 25.0 g\nc = 4.18 J/g°C\nInitial temperature (T1) = 25°C\nFinal temperature (T2) = 60°C\n\nFirst, we need to find the change in temperature (ΔT):\nΔT = T2 - T1\nΔT = 60°C - 25°C\nΔT = 35°C\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\nq = (25.0 g)(4.18 J/g°C)(35°C)\n\nq = 25.0 * 4.18 * 35\nq = 3662.5 J\n\nSo, the heat required to raise the temperature of 25.0 g of water from 25°C to 60°C is 3662.5 Joules."
