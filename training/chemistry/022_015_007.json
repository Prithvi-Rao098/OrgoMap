    "message_2": "To calculate the percent yield, we first need to determine the theoretical yield of alum from the given amount of potassium hydroxide.\n\n1. Calculate the moles of potassium hydroxide (KOH):\nKOH molar mass = 39.1 (K) + 15.999 (O) + 1.008 (H) = 56.107 g/mol\nmoles of KOH = (12 g) / (56.107 g/mol) = 0.2139 mol\n\n2. Write the balanced chemical equation for the synthesis of alum:\n2 KOH + Al2(SO4)3 + 12 H2O → 2 KAl(SO4)2·12H2O\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 2 moles of KOH react to produce 2 moles of alum. Therefore, the mole ratio of KOH to alum is 1:1.\n\n3. Calculate the moles of alum (KAl(SO4)2·12H2O) produced:\nSince the mole ratio is 1:1, the moles of alum produced are equal to the moles of KOH used: 0.2139 mol.\n\n4. Calculate the theoretical yield of alum:\nAlum molar mass = 39.1 (K) + 26.98 (Al) + (4 × 32.07) (S) + (24 × 15.999) (O) + (24 × 1.008) (H) = 474.4 g/mol\ntheoretical yield = (0.2139 mol) × (474.4 g/mol) = 101.5 g\n\n5. Calculate the percent yield:\npercent yield = (actual yield / theoretical yield) × 100\npercent yield = (9.3 g / 101.5 g) × 100 = 9.16%\n\nThe percent yield of this reaction is 9.16%."
