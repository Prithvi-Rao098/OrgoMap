Given the molar enthalpies of formation of AgCl(s) and HCl(g) are -127.01 kJ/mol and -92.31 kJ/mol, respectively. The balanced equation for the reaction is: AgNO3(aq) + HCl(aq) → AgCl(s) + HNO3(aq)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the precipitation reaction, we need to use Hess's Law, which states that the enthalpy change for a reaction is the same whether it occurs in one step or several steps. We can use the enthalpies of formation of the reactants and products to determine the enthalpy change for the reaction.\n\nΔH_reaction = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nFirst, we need the enthalpies of formation for all the reactants and products. We are given the values for AgCl(s) and HCl(g), but we need the values for AgNO3(aq) and HNO3(aq). The standard enthalpies of formation for AgNO3(aq) and HNO3(aq) are -124.41 kJ/mol and -174.1 kJ/mol, respectively.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔH_reaction = [ΔH_f(AgCl) + ΔH_f(HNO3)] - [ΔH_f(AgNO3) + ΔH_f(HCl)]\n\nΔH_reaction = [(-127.01 kJ/mol) + (-174.1 kJ/mol)] - [(-124.41 kJ/mol) + (-92.31 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH_reaction = (-301.11 kJ/mol) - (-216.72 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH_reaction = -84.39 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the precipitation reaction of solid silver chloride (AgCl) from the aqueous solution with the precipitation agent, hydrochloric acid (HCl) is -84.39 kJ/mol."
