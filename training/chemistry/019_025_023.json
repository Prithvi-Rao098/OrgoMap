    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction, we need to use the following equation:\n\nΔH° = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH° is the standard enthalpy change, and ΔHf° is the standard enthalpy of formation for each substance.\n\nFirst, let's write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nCuSO4·5H2O (s) + 2 KOH (s) → Cu(OH)2 (s) + K2SO4 (s) + 5 H2O (l)\n\nNow, we need the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) for each substance involved in the reaction. These values can be found in standard thermodynamic tables:\n\nΔHf°(CuSO4·5H2O) = -1540 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(KOH) = -425.8 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(Cu(OH)2) = -1004 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(K2SO4) = -1438 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(H2O) = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔH° = [1(-1004) + 1(-1438) + 5(-285.8)] - [1(-1540) + 2(-425.8)]\n\nΔH° = [-1004 - 1438 - 1429] - [-1540 - 851.6]\n\nΔH° = [-3871] - [-2391.6]\n\nΔH° = -1479.4 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the reaction between copper sulfate pentahydrate and potassium hydroxide to form copper hydroxide and potassium sulfate at 25°C is -1479.4 kJ/mol."
