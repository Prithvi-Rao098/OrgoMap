    "message_2": "To calculate the standard electrode potential for the given reaction, we need to subtract the standard electrode potential of the oxidation half-reaction from the standard electrode potential of the reduction half-reaction.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the oxidation and reduction half-reactions. In this case, Zn is being oxidized (losing electrons) and Cu2+ is being reduced (gaining electrons).\n\nOxidation half-reaction: Zn(s) → Zn2+(aq) + 2e- (reverse of the given Zn half-reaction)\nReduction half-reaction: Cu2+(aq) + 2e- → Cu(s) (given Cu half-reaction)\n\nNow, we need to find the standard electrode potential for the oxidation half-reaction. Since the given Zn half-reaction is the reverse of the oxidation half-reaction, we need to change the sign of its standard electrode potential:\n\nEtheta(oxidation) = -(-0.76 V) = 0.76 V\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard electrode potential for the overall reaction:\n\nEtheta(reaction) = Etheta(reduction) - Etheta(oxidation)\nEtheta(reaction) = 0.34 V - 0.76 V\nEtheta(reaction) = -0.42 V\n\nSo, the standard electrode potential for the given reaction is -0.42 V."
