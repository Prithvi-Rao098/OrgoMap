    "message_2": "There are five main types of chemical reactions: synthesis, decomposition, single displacement, double displacement, and combustion. Here are their associated equations and examples:\n\n1. Synthesis (combination) reaction:\nGeneral equation: A + B → AB\nIn a synthesis reaction, two or more reactants combine to form a single product.\n\nExample: \nN₂(g) + 3H₂(g) → 2NH₃(g)\nIn this example, nitrogen gas (N₂) reacts with hydrogen gas (H₂) to form ammonia (NH₃).\n\nIdentification: Look for two or more reactants combining to form a single product.\n\n2. Decomposition reaction:\nGeneral equation: AB → A + B\nIn a decomposition reaction, a single reactant breaks down into two or more simpler products.\n\nExample:\n2H₂O(l) → 2H₂(g) + O₂(g)\nIn this example, water (H₂O) decomposes into hydrogen gas (H₂) and oxygen gas (O₂).\n\nIdentification: Look for a single reactant breaking down into two or more simpler products.\n\n3. Single displacement (replacement) reaction:\nGeneral equation: A + BC → B + AC\nIn a single displacement reaction, one element replaces another element in a compound.\n\nExample:\nZn(s) + 2HCl(aq) → ZnCl₂(aq) + H₂(g)\nIn this example, zinc (Zn) displaces hydrogen (H) in hydrochloric acid (HCl) to form zinc chloride (ZnCl₂) and hydrogen gas (H₂).\n\nIdentification: Look for an element replacing another element in a compound.\n\n4. Double displacement (metathesis) reaction:\nGeneral equation: AB + CD → AD + CB\nIn a double displacement reaction, the positive ions of two compounds exchange places, forming two new compounds.\n\nExample:\nAgNO₃(aq) + NaCl(aq) → AgCl(s) + NaNO₃(aq)\nIn this example, silver nitrate (AgNO₃) and sodium chloride (NaCl) exchange ions to form silver chloride (AgCl) and sodium nitrate (NaNO₃).\n\nIdentification: Look for two compounds exchanging ions to form two new compounds.\n\n5. Combustion reaction:\nGeneral equation: CxHy + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O\nIn a combustion reaction, a hydrocarbon (compound containing carbon and hydrogen) reacts with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water.\n\nExample:\nCH₄(g) + 2O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\nIn this example, methane (CH₄) combusts in the presence of oxygen (O₂) to produce carbon dioxide (CO₂) and water (H₂O).\n\nIdentification: Look for a hydrocarbon reacting with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water."
