    "message_2": "To calculate the heat of neutralization, we first need to determine the amount of heat released during the reaction. We can do this using the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat released, m is the mass of the solution, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nFirst, let's find the mass of the solution. Since the density of the mixture is 1 g/mL, the mass of the solution is equal to its volume:\n\nmass = 50 mL HCl + 50 mL NaOH = 100 mL = 100 g\n\nNext, we'll find the change in temperature:\n\nΔT = T_final - T_initial = 32°C - 25°C = 7°C\n\nNow we can calculate the heat released:\n\nq = mcΔT = (100 g)(4.18 J/g°C)(7°C) = 2926 J\n\nNow we need to find the moles of HCl and NaOH that reacted. Since both solutions have a concentration of 2 M and a volume of 50 mL, we can calculate the moles as follows:\n\nmoles HCl = (2 mol/L)(0.05 L) = 0.1 mol\nmoles NaOH = (2 mol/L)(0.05 L) = 0.1 mol\n\nSince HCl and NaOH react in a 1:1 ratio, all of the moles of both reactants will be consumed in the reaction. Therefore, 0.1 mol of HCl and 0.1 mol of NaOH will react.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the heat of neutralization per mole of reaction:\n\nHeat of neutralization = q / moles of reaction = 2926 J / 0.1 mol = 29,260 J/mol\n\nSo, the heat of neutralization when 50 mL of 2 M HCl solution is mixed with 50 mL of 2 M NaOH solution and the temperature rises from 25°C to 32°C is 29,260 J/mol."
