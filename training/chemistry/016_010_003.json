The initial temperature of the water was 25.0°C and the final temperature after dissolving NaOH was 31.0°C. Assume the specific heat capacity of the solution is the same as that of water (4.18 J/g°C) and the density of the solution is 1.00 g/mL.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change, we can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat absorbed or released, m is the mass of the solution, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nFirst, we need to find the mass of the solution. Since the density of the solution is 1.00 g/mL, we can convert the volume of the solution (350.0 mL) to mass:\n\nmass of solution = volume × density\nmass of solution = 350.0 mL × 1.00 g/mL = 350.0 g\n\nNext, we need to find the change in temperature (ΔT):\n\nΔT = T_final - T_initial\nΔT = 31.0°C - 25.0°C = 6.0°C\n\nNow we can calculate the heat absorbed or released (q):\n\nq = mcΔT\nq = (350.0 g)(4.18 J/g°C)(6.0°C)\nq = 8742 J\n\nSince the temperature of the solution increased, the reaction is exothermic, and the enthalpy change is negative:\n\nΔH = -8742 J\n\nSo, the enthalpy change when 14.0 g of sodium hydroxide dissolves in 350.0 mL of water is -8742 J."
