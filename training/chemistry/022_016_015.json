    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction when 4.5 moles of hydrogen gas and 2.25 moles of oxygen gas react to form water, we need to first determine the limiting reactant. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\n2 H2 (g) + O2 (g) → 2 H2O (l)\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that the stoichiometric ratio of H2 to O2 is 2:1. Now, let's find the limiting reactant:\n\nFor H2: 4.5 moles H2 * (1 mole O2 / 2 moles H2) = 2.25 moles O2 required\nFor O2: 2.25 moles O2 * (2 moles H2 / 1 mole O2) = 4.5 moles H2 required\n\nSince both reactants are present in the exact stoichiometric ratio, neither is in excess, and both will be completely consumed in the reaction.\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction. We know that the enthalpy change for the reaction between 2 moles of H2 and 1 mole of O2 is -484 kJ. We can use this information to find the enthalpy change for the reaction with 4.5 moles of H2 and 2.25 moles of O2:\n\nΔH = (-484 kJ) * (4.5 moles H2 / 2 moles H2) = -484 kJ * 2.25 = -1089 kJ\n\nSo, the enthalpy change for the reaction when 4.5 moles of hydrogen gas and 2.25 moles of oxygen gas react to form water is -1089 kJ."
