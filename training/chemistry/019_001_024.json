Given the following balanced chemical equation: \n\nCH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(g)\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation for methane gas is -74.8 kJ/mol, carbon dioxide gas is -393.5 kJ/mol, and water vapor is -241.8 kJ/mol.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of methane gas, we can use the following formula:\n\nΔH_combustion = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nFirst, we need to determine the number of moles of methane (CH4) in 10 grams. The molar mass of CH4 is 12.01 g/mol (C) + 4 * 1.01 g/mol (H) = 16.05 g/mol.\n\nmoles of CH4 = mass / molar mass = 10 g / 16.05 g/mol ≈ 0.623 moles\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of methane:\n\nΔH_combustion = [1 * ΔH_f(CO2) + 2 * ΔH_f(H2O)] - [ΔH_f(CH4) + 2 * ΔH_f(O2)]\n\nSince the standard enthalpy of formation for oxygen gas (O2) is zero (it is in its standard state), the formula becomes:\n\nΔH_combustion = [1 * (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 * (-241.8 kJ/mol)] - [(-74.8 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH_combustion = (-393.5 - 2 * 241.8 + 74.8) kJ/mol ≈ -802.9 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of 0.623 moles of methane:\n\nΔH = ΔH_combustion * moles of CH4 = -802.9 kJ/mol * 0.623 mol ≈ -500.2 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change for the combustion of 10 grams of methane gas is approximately -500.2 kJ."
