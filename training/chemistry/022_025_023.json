    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of titration and the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH):\n\nH₂SO₄ + 2NaOH → Na₂SO₄ + 2H₂O\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of H₂SO₄ reacts with 2 moles of NaOH. We can use this stoichiometry to find the concentration of the sulfuric acid solution.\n\nFirst, let's find the moles of NaOH used in the titration:\n\nmoles of NaOH = (volume of NaOH) × (concentration of NaOH)\nmoles of NaOH = (32.5 mL) × (0.125 mol/L)\n\nSince 1 mL = 0.001 L, we can convert the volume to liters:\n\nmoles of NaOH = (0.0325 L) × (0.125 mol/L)\nmoles of NaOH = 0.0040625 mol\n\nNow, we can use the stoichiometry from the balanced equation to find the moles of H₂SO₄:\n\nmoles of H₂SO₄ = (moles of NaOH) / 2\nmoles of H₂SO₄ = 0.0040625 mol / 2\nmoles of H₂SO₄ = 0.00203125 mol\n\nFinally, we can find the concentration of the sulfuric acid solution:\n\nconcentration of H₂SO₄ = (moles of H₂SO₄) / (volume of H₂SO₄)\n\nAgain, we need to convert the volume to liters:\n\nconcentration of H₂SO₄ = (0.00203125 mol) / (0.025 L)\nconcentration of H₂SO₄ = 0.08125 mol/L\n\nSo, the concentration of the sulfuric acid solution is 0.08125 M."
