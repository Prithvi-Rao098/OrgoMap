    "message_1": "How much chlorine gas is needed to prepare 5 grams of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid from benzoic acid if the yield of the reaction is 85%?",
    "message_2": "To determine the amount of chlorine gas needed, we first need to calculate the moles of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid that we want to prepare and then determine the moles of chlorine gas required for the reaction. Finally, we will convert the moles of chlorine gas to grams.\n\n1. Calculate the moles of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid:\nMolecular weight of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid = 12.01 (C) x 7 + 1.01 (H) x 2 + 16.00 (O) x 2 + 35.45 (Cl) x 2 = 197.00 g/mol\n\n5 g of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid / 197.00 g/mol = 0.02538 moles\n\n2. Calculate the moles of benzoic acid needed considering the 85% yield:\n0.02538 moles / 0.85 = 0.02986 moles of benzoic acid needed\n\n3. Calculate the moles of chlorine gas required:\nThe reaction between benzoic acid and chlorine gas to form 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid requires 2 moles of chlorine gas for each mole of benzoic acid.\n\n0.02986 moles of benzoic acid x 2 moles of chlorine gas = 0.05972 moles of chlorine gas\n\n4. Convert moles of chlorine gas to grams:\nMolecular weight of chlorine gas (Cl2) = 35.45 (Cl) x 2 = 70.90 g/mol\n\n0.05972 moles of chlorine gas x 70.90 g/mol = 4.23 g of chlorine gas\n\nTherefore, 4.23 grams of chlorine gas is needed to prepare 5 grams of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid from benzoic acid with an 85% yield."
