    "message_2": "To determine the concentration of iron (II) ions in the water sample using colorimetry, we can use the Beer-Lambert Law, which states:\n\nA = ε * c * l\n\nwhere A is the absorbance, ε is the molar extinction coefficient, c is the concentration of the solute (in this case, iron (II) ions), and l is the path length of the cuvette (usually in cm).\n\nWe are given the following values:\nA = 0.295\nε = 11,300 M^-1cm^-1\nl = 1 cm (assuming a standard cuvette)\n\nNow, we can rearrange the equation to solve for the concentration (c):\n\nc = A / (ε * l)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nc = 0.295 / (11,300 M^-1cm^-1 * 1 cm)\n\nc ≈ 0.0000261 M\n\nSo, the concentration of iron (II) ions in the water sample is approximately 0.0000261 M or 26.1 µM."
