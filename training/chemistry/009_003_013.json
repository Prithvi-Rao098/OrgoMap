    "message_2": "To calculate the energy released in a nuclear fission reaction, we need to know the energy released per fission event and the number of fission events that occur. \n\n1. Energy released per fission event:\nFor uranium-235, the energy released per fission event is approximately 200 MeV (million electron volts).\n\n2. Number of fission events:\nFirst, we need to find the number of uranium-235 atoms in 1.5 grams. To do this, we'll use the molar mass of uranium-235, which is 235 g/mol.\n\n1.5 g U-235 * (1 mol U-235 / 235 g U-235) = 0.00638 mol U-235\n\nNow, we'll use Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol) to find the number of uranium-235 atoms in 1.5 grams.\n\n0.00638 mol U-235 * (6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol) = 3.84 x 10^21 atoms U-235\n\n3. Calculate the total energy released:\nNow that we have the energy released per fission event and the number of fission events, we can calculate the total energy released.\n\nTotal energy released = (Energy per fission event) x (Number of fission events)\nTotal energy released = (200 MeV/atom) x (3.84 x 10^21 atoms)\n\nTo convert MeV to Joules, we use the conversion factor 1 MeV = 1.602 x 10^-13 Joules.\n\nTotal energy released = (200 MeV/atom) x (3.84 x 10^21 atoms) x (1.602 x 10^-13 J/MeV)\nTotal energy released = 1.23 x 10^11 Joules\n\nSo, the energy released in a nuclear fission reaction in which 1.5 grams of uranium-235 undergoes complete fission is approximately 1.23 x 10^11 Joules."
