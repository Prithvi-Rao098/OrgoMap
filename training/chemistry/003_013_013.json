How would this compare to the maximum work that could be extracted from the same process if it were reversible?",
    "message_2": "The maximum work that can be extracted from a non-equilibrium, irreversible process occurring in a closed system with fixed initial and final states can be determined using the concept of exergy. Exergy is the maximum useful work that can be obtained from a system as it comes to equilibrium with its surroundings.\n\nFor an irreversible process, the exergy (E) can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nE = ΔG = ΔH - TΔS\n\nwhere ΔG is the change in Gibbs free energy, ΔH is the change in enthalpy, T is the temperature, and ΔS is the change in entropy.\n\nFor a reversible process, the maximum work (W) that can be extracted is equal to the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) of the process:\n\nW = ΔG\n\nIn a reversible process, the system is always in equilibrium with its surroundings, and the process occurs infinitely slowly. As a result, the maximum work that can be extracted from a reversible process is always greater than or equal to the maximum work that can be extracted from an irreversible process with the same initial and final states.\n\nIn summary, the maximum work that can be extracted from a non-equilibrium, irreversible process occurring in a closed system with fixed initial and final states is given by the exergy (E) of the process, which is generally less than the maximum work that can be extracted from the same process if it were reversible. The difference between the maximum work for the reversible and irreversible processes is due to the irreversibilities (such as friction, heat losses, and other dissipative effects) that occur during the irreversible process."
