    "message_1": "Calculate the standard enthalpy change (∆H) for the vaporization of 25.0 g of water at its boiling point (100°C) and 1 atm pressure assuming the heat capacity of water to be constant. \n\nGiven: The heat of vaporization for water is 40.7 kJ/mol and the molar mass of water is 18.015 g/mol.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the vaporization of 25.0 g of water, we first need to determine the number of moles of water present. We can do this using the molar mass of water:\n\nmoles of water = mass of water / molar mass of water\nmoles of water = 25.0 g / 18.015 g/mol\nmoles of water ≈ 1.387 moles\n\nNow that we have the number of moles, we can calculate the enthalpy change using the heat of vaporization:\n\n∆H = moles of water × heat of vaporization\n∆H = 1.387 moles × 40.7 kJ/mol\n∆H ≈ 56.5 kJ\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the vaporization of 25.0 g of water at its boiling point and 1 atm pressure is approximately 56.5 kJ."
