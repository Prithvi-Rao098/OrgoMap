    "message_2": "In nuclear medicine and cancer treatment, one of the most commonly used radioactive isotopes is Iodine-131 (I-131). It is primarily used in the treatment of thyroid cancer, as well as some non-cancerous thyroid conditions.\n\nIodine-131 works to destroy cancer cells without damaging healthy cells due to its selective uptake by the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland has a unique ability to absorb and concentrate iodine, which is essential for the production of thyroid hormones. When I-131 is administered, it is absorbed by the thyroid gland, including any cancerous thyroid cells that may be present.\n\nOnce inside the cancer cells, the radioactive iodine emits beta particles, which are a form of ionizing radiation. These beta particles damage the DNA of the cancer cells, eventually leading to cell death. The range of beta particles is relatively short, typically only a few millimeters, which helps to minimize damage to surrounding healthy cells.\n\nIn some cases, other radioactive isotopes may be used for cancer treatment, such as Lutetium-177 (Lu-177) for neuroendocrine tumors or Radium-223 (Ra-223) for bone metastases from prostate cancer. These isotopes work in a similar way, emitting ionizing radiation that damages the DNA of cancer cells and leads to cell death while minimizing damage to healthy cells. However, Iodine-131 remains one of the most widely used radioactive isotopes in cancer treatment due to its effectiveness in treating thyroid cancer."
