    "message_2": "The rate of reaction can be determined using the formula:\n\nRate of reaction = (change in concentration) / (change in time)\n\nFirst, we need to find the change in concentration of hydrogen peroxide. The balanced equation for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide is:\n\n2H2O2 → 2H2O + O2\n\nFrom the stoichiometry of the reaction, we can see that for every 2 moles of hydrogen peroxide, 1 mole of oxygen gas is produced. So, if 0.02 moles of oxygen gas are produced, the amount of hydrogen peroxide decomposed is:\n\n0.02 moles O2 × (2 moles H2O2 / 1 mole O2) = 0.04 moles H2O2\n\nNow, we need to find the change in concentration of hydrogen peroxide. Since the initial concentration is 0.1 M, we can calculate the final concentration as follows:\n\nFinal concentration = (Initial moles - Decomposed moles) / Volume\n\nWe are not given the volume, so we can use the variable V for the volume:\n\nFinal concentration = (0.1V - 0.04) / V\n\nNow, we can find the change in concentration:\n\nChange in concentration = Initial concentration - Final concentration\nChange in concentration = 0.1V - (0.1V - 0.04) / V\n\nThe change in time is given as 30 seconds. Now we can find the rate of reaction:\n\nRate of reaction = (change in concentration) / (change in time)\nRate of reaction = (0.04 / V) / 30\n\nSince we don't have the volume, the rate of reaction can be expressed as:\n\nRate of reaction = (0.04 / (30V)) M/s"
