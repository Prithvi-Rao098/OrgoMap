    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction, we can use the formula:\n\nKc = [Products] / [Reactants]\n\nFor the given reaction, the balanced equation is:\n\n2NO2(g) ⇌ N2O4(g)\n\nThe equilibrium expression for this reaction is:\n\nKc = [N2O4] / [NO2]^2\n\nAt equilibrium, the concentrations are given as [NO2] = 0.25 M and [N2O4] = 0.10 M. Plug these values into the equilibrium expression:\n\nKc = (0.10) / (0.25)^2\n\nKc = 0.10 / 0.0625\n\nKc ≈ 1.6\n\nThe equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction is approximately 1.6."
