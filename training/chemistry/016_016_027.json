All other substances are in their standard state.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH° = Σ ΔH°(products) - Σ ΔH°(reactants)\n\nThe enthalpy of formation for Fe2O3(s) is -824.2 kJ/mol, and the enthalpy of formation for CO2(g) is -393.5 kJ/mol. The enthalpy of formation for elements in their standard state, such as C(s) and Fe(s), is 0 kJ/mol.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the equation:\n\nΔH° = [4 × 0 (Fe) + 3 × (-393.5) (CO2)] - [2 × (-824.2) (Fe2O3) + 3 × 0 (C)]\n\nΔH° = [0 + (-1180.5)] - [(-1648.4) + 0]\n\nΔH° = -1180.5 + 1648.4\n\nΔH° = 467.9 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the reduction of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) to iron (Fe) is 467.9 kJ."
