    "message_2": "In NaNO3 (sodium nitrate), the oxidation state of sodium (Na) is +1, and the oxidation state of oxygen (O) is -2. To determine the oxidation state of nitrogen (N), we can use the formula:\n\nOverall charge = (oxidation state of Na) + (oxidation state of N) + 3 * (oxidation state of O)\n\nSince sodium nitrate is a neutral compound, the overall charge is 0. Therefore:\n\n0 = (+1) + (oxidation state of N) + 3 * (-2)\n\n0 = 1 + (oxidation state of N) - 6\n\n5 = oxidation state of N\n\nSo, the oxidation state of nitrogen in NaNO3 is +5."
