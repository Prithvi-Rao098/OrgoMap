    "message_2": "To calculate the activation energy (Ea) of the reaction, we can use the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk = A * exp(-Ea / R * T)\n\nwhere k is the rate constant, A is the pre-exponential factor, Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant (8.314 J mol^-1 K^-1), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nWe have two sets of data: k1 = 0.00313 L mol^-1 s^-1 at T1 = 25°C (298.15 K) and k2 = 0.05012 L mol^-1 s^-1 at T2 = 35°C (308.15 K). We can set up two equations using the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk1 = A * exp(-Ea / R * T1)\nk2 = A * exp(-Ea / R * T2)\n\nNow, we can divide the first equation by the second equation to eliminate the pre-exponential factor (A):\n\nk1 / k2 = exp(-Ea / R * (1/T1 - 1/T2))\n\nWe can rearrange the equation to solve for Ea:\n\nEa = R * ln(k1 / k2) / (1/T1 - 1/T2)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nEa = 8.314 J mol^-1 K^-1 * ln(0.00313 / 0.05012) / (1/298.15 - 1/308.15)\n\nEa ≈ -8.314 * ln(0.0624) / (-0.0034)\n\nEa ≈ 68.5 kJ/mol\n\nThe activation energy of the reaction is approximately 68.5 kJ/mol at room temperature."
