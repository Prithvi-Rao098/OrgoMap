    "message_2": "The predicted molecular geometry of the carbon dioxide (CO2) molecule is linear. The bond angle between the carbon and the two oxygen atoms is 180 degrees. This is because carbon has four valence electrons and forms two double bonds with the two oxygen atoms, resulting in a linear arrangement with no lone pairs on the central carbon atom."
