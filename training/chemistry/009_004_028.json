    "message_2": "Nuclear fusion reactions require extremely high temperatures to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between positively charged nuclei. The minimum temperature required to initiate a nuclear fusion reaction between two deuterium nuclei is around 15 million Kelvin (15 x 10^6 K). This temperature is necessary for the deuterium-deuterium (D-D) fusion reaction to occur.\n\nIn comparison, the fusion reaction between two hydrogen nuclei (protons) is called the proton-proton (p-p) chain reaction, which occurs in the core of the Sun. The minimum temperature required for this reaction is around 4 million Kelvin (4 x 10^6 K). \n\nSo, the temperature required for a fusion reaction between two deuterium nuclei is significantly higher than the temperature required for a fusion reaction between two hydrogen nuclei."
