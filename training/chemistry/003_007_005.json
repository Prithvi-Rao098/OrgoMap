    "message_2": "To calculate the average energy and specific heat capacity of the system, we first need to determine the degrees of freedom for the gas molecules. Since it is an ideal gas, we can assume that the gas molecules are non-linear and have 3 translational degrees of freedom.\n\nFor an isochoric process, the volume remains constant, and only the translational degrees of freedom contribute to the internal energy and specific heat capacity.\n\n1. Average energy:\nThe average energy (E) of an ideal gas can be calculated using the equipartition theorem, which states that the average energy per molecule is given by:\n\nE = (f/2) * k * T\n\nwhere f is the degrees of freedom (f = 3 for translational degrees of freedom), k is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10^(-23) J/K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nE = (3/2) * (1.38 × 10^(-23) J/K) * 300 K\nE ≈ 6.21 × 10^(-21) J\n\nThe average energy per molecule is approximately 6.21 × 10^(-21) J.\n\n2. Specific heat capacity:\nThe specific heat capacity at constant volume (Cv) for an ideal gas can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nCv = (f/2) * R\n\nwhere f is the degrees of freedom (f = 3 for translational degrees of freedom) and R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J/mol K).\n\nCv = (3/2) * 8.314 J/mol K\nCv ≈ 12.471 J/mol K\n\nThe specific heat capacity at constant volume for the gas is approximately 12.471 J/mol K.\n\nNow, we have the average energy per molecule and the specific heat capacity at constant volume for the system."
