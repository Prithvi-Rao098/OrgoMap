    "message_2": "To determine the maximum yield of nylon-6,6, we first need to find the limiting reagent in the reaction. The molecular weights of adipic acid (C6H10O4) and hexamethylenediamine (C6H16N2) are:\n\nMolecular weight of adipic acid = (6 × 12.01) + (10 × 1.01) + (4 × 16.00) = 146.14 g/mol\nMolecular weight of hexamethylenediamine = (6 × 12.01) + (16 × 1.01) + (2 × 14.01) = 116.21 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the moles of each reactant:\n\nMoles of adipic acid = 100 g / 146.14 g/mol = 0.684 moles\nMoles of hexamethylenediamine = 100 g / 116.21 g/mol = 0.860 moles\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the formation of nylon-6,6 is:\n\nC6H10O4 + C6H16N2 → C12H22N2O4 + 2 H2O\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that the mole ratio of adipic acid to hexamethylenediamine is 1:1. Since there are fewer moles of adipic acid, it is the limiting reagent.\n\nNow, we can calculate the maximum yield of nylon-6,6 using the moles of the limiting reagent (adipic acid) and the molecular weight of nylon-6,6:\n\nMolecular weight of nylon-6,6 = (12 × 12.01) + (22 × 1.01) + (2 × 14.01) + (4 × 16.00) = 226.32 g/mol\n\nMaximum yield of nylon-6,6 = 0.684 moles × 226.32 g/mol = 154.80 g\n\nTherefore, the maximum yield of nylon-6,6 that can be obtained from 100 grams of adipic acid and 100 grams of hexamethylenediamine is 154.80 grams, assuming a perfect reaction with no byproducts."
