    "message_2": "The addition of a catalyst to the decomposition reaction of hydrogen peroxide significantly increases the reaction rate. A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without being consumed in the process. It achieves this by providing an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy, which allows more reactant molecules to have sufficient energy to undergo the reaction.\n\nIn the case of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) decomposition, the reaction can be slow at room temperature without a catalyst. The reaction is as follows:\n\n2H2O2 â†’ 2H2O + O2\n\nWhen a catalyst, such as manganese dioxide (MnO2), potassium iodide (KI), or catalase (an enzyme found in living organisms), is added to the reaction, the activation energy is lowered, and the reaction rate increases significantly. This results in a faster production of water (H2O) and oxygen gas (O2).\n\nThe catalyst achieves this by forming intermediate species during the reaction, which quickly break down to form the products and regenerate the catalyst. In this way, the catalyst remains unchanged at the end of the reaction and can continue to catalyze further decomposition of hydrogen peroxide."
