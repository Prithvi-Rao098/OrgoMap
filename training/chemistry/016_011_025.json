    "message_2": "To calculate the standard heat of mixing, we first need to determine the number of moles of HCl and NaOH that are reacting.\n\nNumber of moles of HCl = (concentration of HCl) x (volume of HCl)\nNumber of moles of HCl = (1 mol/L) x (50 mL) x (1 L/1000 mL) = 0.05 mol\n\nNumber of moles of NaOH = (concentration of NaOH) x (volume of NaOH)\nNumber of moles of NaOH = (1 mol/L) x (100 mL) x (1 L/1000 mL) = 0.1 mol\n\nSince HCl and NaOH react in a 1:1 ratio, the limiting reactant is HCl with 0.05 mol. Therefore, 0.05 mol of HCl will react with 0.05 mol of NaOH.\n\nNow we can calculate the heat of mixing using the standard heat of neutralization:\n\nHeat of mixing = (moles of HCl) x (standard heat of neutralization)\nHeat of mixing = (0.05 mol) x (-57.32 kJ/mol) = -2.866 kJ\n\nThe standard heat of mixing when 50 mL of 1 M HCl is mixed with 100 mL of 1 M NaOH at 25°C is -2.866 kJ."
