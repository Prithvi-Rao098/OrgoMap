    "message_1": "How does the addition of a catalyst affect the position of equilibrium in a redox reaction mixture, and can you calculate the change in equilibrium constant (Kc) with the aid of Le Chatelier's principle? Use the following reaction as an example to illustrate your solution:\n\n2H2O2 (aq) ⟶ 2 H2O (l) + O2 (g)\n\nAssume the standard equilibrium constant, Kc = [H2O]2[O2] / [H2O2]2, is 1.6 x 103, and calculate the new value of Kc if a catalyst that increases the rate of decomposition of hydrogen peroxide is added.",
    "message_2": "The addition of a catalyst to a reaction mixture does not affect the position of equilibrium or the equilibrium constant (Kc). A catalyst works by lowering the activation energy of the reaction, which increases the rate at which the reaction proceeds. However, it does not change the relative stability of the reactants and products, so the equilibrium constant remains the same.\n\nIn the case of the given reaction:\n\n2H2O2 (aq) ⟶ 2 H2O (l) + O2 (g)\n\nThe equilibrium constant, Kc, is given as 1.6 x 10^3. If a catalyst is added that increases the rate of decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, the reaction will reach equilibrium more quickly, but the value of Kc will not change. Therefore, the new value of Kc after adding the catalyst will still be 1.6 x 10^3.\n\nLe Chatelier's principle states that if a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in concentration, temperature, or pressure, the system will adjust to counteract the change and restore a new equilibrium. However, since the catalyst does not change the position of equilibrium, Le Chatelier's principle does not apply in this case."
