    "message_2": "The most effective catalyst for the oxidation reaction of carbon monoxide (CO) to carbon dioxide (CO2) in a gas mixture containing both CO and CO2 is platinum (Pt) supported on a metal oxide, such as alumina (Al2O3) or ceria (CeO2). This catalyst is widely used in automotive catalytic converters to reduce harmful emissions, including converting CO to CO2. Other noble metals, such as palladium (Pd) and rhodium (Rh), can also be effective catalysts for this reaction."
