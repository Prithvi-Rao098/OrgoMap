    "message_1": "What is the new equilibrium constant at 500°C for the reaction N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g) if the original equilibrium constant at 300°C was 4.34 x 10^-3 and the enthalpy change of the reaction is -92.4 kJ/mol? (Assuming ΔH° and ΔS° do not change with temperature)",
    "message_2": "To find the new equilibrium constant at 500°C, we can use the van't Hoff equation:\n\nln(K2/K1) = -ΔH°/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere K1 is the original equilibrium constant at 300°C, K2 is the new equilibrium constant at 500°C, ΔH° is the enthalpy change of the reaction, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T1 is the original temperature (300°C) in Kelvin, and T2 is the new temperature (500°C) in Kelvin.\n\nFirst, convert the temperatures to Kelvin:\nT1 = 300°C + 273.15 = 573.15 K\nT2 = 500°C + 273.15 = 773.15 K\n\nNext, convert the enthalpy change to J/mol:\nΔH° = -92.4 kJ/mol * 1000 J/kJ = -92400 J/mol\n\nNow, plug the values into the van't Hoff equation:\nln(K2/4.34 x 10^-3) = -(-92400 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K) * (1/773.15 K - 1/573.15 K)\n\nSolve for K2:\nln(K2/4.34 x 10^-3) = 15.99\nK2/4.34 x 10^-3 = e^15.99\nK2 = 4.34 x 10^-3 * e^15.99\nK2 ≈ 1.47 x 10^4\n\nThe new equilibrium constant at 500°C for the reaction is approximately 1.47 x 10^4."
