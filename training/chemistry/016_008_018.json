    "message_1": "What is the enthalpy of fusion (in kJ/mol) for water at a temperature of 0°C, given that the specific heat capacity of ice is 2.09 J/g°C, the specific heat capacity of liquid water is 4.18 J/g°C, and the heat of vaporization of water is 40.7 kJ/mol? (The heat of fusion of water is 6.01 kJ/mol)",
    "message_2": "The enthalpy of fusion for water at 0°C is already given in the problem statement. It is 6.01 kJ/mol. This value represents the energy required to convert 1 mole of ice at 0°C to liquid water at 0°C."
