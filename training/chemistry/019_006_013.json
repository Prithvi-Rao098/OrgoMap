    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction, we first need to determine the changes in the concentrations of the reactants and products at equilibrium. \n\nGiven the balanced equation: N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g)\n\nAt equilibrium, the concentration of NH3 is 0.3 M. Since 2 moles of NH3 are produced for every mole of N2 and 3 moles of H2 consumed, we can determine the changes in the concentrations of N2 and H2.\n\nChange in NH3 concentration = +0.3 M (since it increased from 0 to 0.3 M)\nChange in N2 concentration = -0.15 M (since 0.3 M NH3 / 2 = 0.15 M N2)\nChange in H2 concentration = -0.45 M (since 0.3 M NH3 * 3/2 = 0.45 M H2)\n\nNow, we can find the equilibrium concentrations of N2 and H2:\n\n[N2] = initial concentration - change in concentration = 0.1 M - (-0.15 M) = 0.25 M\n[H2] = initial concentration - change in concentration = 0.2 M - (-0.45 M) = 0.65 M\n\nNow we can calculate the equilibrium constant (Kc) using the equilibrium concentrations:\n\nKc = [NH3]^2 / ([N2] * [H2]^3) = (0.3)^2 / (0.25 * (0.65)^3) = 0.09 / (0.25 * 0.274625) = 1.31\n\nThe equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g) at 298 K is approximately 1.31."
