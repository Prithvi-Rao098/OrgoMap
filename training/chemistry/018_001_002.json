    "message_2": "Given that the reaction is first-order with respect to H2O2 concentration and zero-order with respect to [I-] concentration, the rate law can be written as:\n\nrate = k[H2O2]^1[I-]^0\n\nSince [I-] is zero-order, its concentration does not affect the rate, so the rate law simplifies to:\n\nrate = k[H2O2]\n\nNow, we need to determine the rate constant, k. We can use the data provided to calculate the rate between two time points. Let's use the data between 0 and 100 seconds:\n\nrate = (0.16 M - 0.2 M) / (100 s - 0 s) = -0.04 M / 100 s = -0.0004 M/s\n\nNote that the rate is negative because the concentration of H2O2 is decreasing over time. Since the rate is constant for a first-order reaction, we can use this rate to find the rate constant, k:\n\n-0.0004 M/s = k(0.2 M)\n\nk = -0.0004 M/s / 0.2 M = -0.002 s^(-1)\n\nNow we have the rate constant, k, and we can write the complete rate law:\n\nrate = -0.002 s^(-1)[H2O2]"
