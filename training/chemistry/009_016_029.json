    "message_1": "A student needs to determine the concentration of a particular radioactive isotope in a sample using gamma spectroscopy. The student has access to a gamma spectrometer with appropriate software that can analyze the gamma spectrum of the sample collected using a suitable detector. Write an equation to calculate the concentration of the radioactive isotope given the activity measured by the spectrometer and include all necessary parameters and units.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the concentration of the radioactive isotope, we can use the following equation:\n\nConcentration (C) = Activity (A) / (Specific Activity (SA) * Mass (m))\n\nWhere:\n- Concentration (C) is the concentration of the radioactive isotope in the sample (Bq/g or Ci/g)\n- Activity (A) is the activity measured by the gamma spectrometer (Bq or Ci)\n- Specific Activity (SA) is the activity per unit mass of the radioactive isotope (Bq/g or Ci/g)\n- Mass (m) is the mass of the sample (g)\n\nThe specific activity can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nSpecific Activity (SA) = Decay Constant (λ) * Avogadro's Number (N_A) / Molar Mass (M)\n\nWhere:\n- Decay Constant (λ) is the decay constant of the radioactive isotope (s⁻¹)\n- Avogadro's Number (N_A) is the number of atoms per mole (6.022 x 10²³ atoms/mol)\n- Molar Mass (M) is the molar mass of the radioactive isotope (g/mol)\n\nBy combining these equations, we can calculate the concentration of the radioactive isotope in the sample."
