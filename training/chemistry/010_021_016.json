    "message_2": "To determine the corrosion potential of the copper electrode when coupled with a zinc electrode in a 1M ZnSO₄ solution at 25°C, we can use the Nernst equation. The Nernst equation relates the reduction potential of an electrochemical reaction to the standard reduction potential, temperature, and concentrations of the reactants and products.\n\nThe Nernst equation is:\n\nE = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\n\nWhere:\nE = reduction potential of the cell\nE° = standard reduction potential of the cell\nR = gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\nT = temperature in Kelvin (25°C = 298K)\nn = number of electrons transferred in the redox reaction\nF = Faraday's constant (96,485 C/mol)\nQ = reaction quotient, which is the ratio of the concentrations of the products to the reactants\n\nFor a Cu/Zn galvanic cell, the overall redox reaction is:\n\nZn(s) + Cu²⁺(aq) → Zn²⁺(aq) + Cu(s)\n\nThe standard reduction potential of the cell (E°) is the difference between the standard reduction potentials of the two half-reactions:\n\nE° = E°(Cu²⁺/Cu) - E°(Zn²⁺/Zn) = 0.337V - (-0.763V) = 1.100V\n\nIn this reaction, 2 electrons are transferred (n = 2). Since the solution is 1M ZnSO₄, we can assume that the concentration of Zn²⁺ ions is 1M. The concentration of Cu²⁺ ions is not given, but since the copper electrode is not corroding, we can assume that the concentration of Cu²⁺ ions is very low and can be neglected in the reaction quotient (Q).\n\nTherefore, Q ≈ [Zn²⁺]/[Cu²⁺] ≈ 1/0 ≈ ∞, and ln(Q) ≈ ∞.\n\nAs ln(Q) approaches infinity, the term (RT/nF) * ln(Q) will also approach infinity, making the reduction potential (E) of the cell very large and positive. This means that the corrosion potential of the copper electrode when coupled with a zinc electrode in a 1M ZnSO₄ solution at 25°C is very high, and the copper electrode will not corrode under these conditions."
