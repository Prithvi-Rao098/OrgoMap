    "message_2": "To determine the maximum yield of benzocaine, we need to first find the limiting reagent in the reaction between p-aminobenzoic acid and ethanol. We will use the stoichiometry of the reaction and the molecular weights of the compounds involved to calculate the theoretical yield of benzocaine.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the synthesis of benzocaine (C9H11NO2) from p-aminobenzoic acid (C7H7NO2) and ethanol (C2H5OH) is as follows:\n\nC7H7NO2 + C2H5OH → C9H11NO2 + H2O\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that the mole ratio of p-aminobenzoic acid to ethanol to benzocaine is 1:1:1.\n\nFirst, we need to find the molecular weights of the compounds involved:\n\nMolecular weight of p-aminobenzoic acid (C7H7NO2) = (7 × 12.01) + (7 × 1.01) + (1 × 14.01) + (2 × 16.00) = 137.14 g/mol\nMolecular weight of ethanol (C2H5OH) = (2 × 12.01) + (6 × 1.01) + (1 × 16.00) = 46.07 g/mol\nMolecular weight of benzocaine (C9H11NO2) = (9 × 12.01) + (11 × 1.01) + (1 × 14.01) + (2 × 16.00) = 165.19 g/mol\n\nNext, we will calculate the moles of p-aminobenzoic acid and ethanol:\n\nMoles of p-aminobenzoic acid = 10 g / 137.14 g/mol = 0.0729 mol\nMoles of ethanol = 20 g / 46.07 g/mol = 0.434 mol\n\nNow, we will determine the limiting reagent by comparing the mole ratio of p-aminobenzoic acid to ethanol:\n\nMole ratio = moles of p-aminobenzoic acid / moles of ethanol = 0.0729 mol / 0.434 mol = 0.168\n\nSince the mole ratio is less than 1, p-aminobenzoic acid is the limiting reagent. Therefore, the maximum yield of benzocaine will be determined by the amount of p-aminobenzoic acid available.\n\nFinally, we will calculate the theoretical yield of benzocaine:\n\nTheoretical yield of benzocaine = moles of p-aminobenzoic acid × molecular weight of benzocaine = 0.0729 mol × 165.19 g/mol = 12.03 g\n\nThus, the maximum yield of benzocaine that can be obtained from 10 grams of p-aminobenzoic acid and 20 grams of ethanol is 12.03 grams."
