    "message_2": "The effect of different light sources (UV, visible, and dark) on the reaction rate of the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by potassium iodide can be investigated through a series of experiments. The reaction can be represented as:\n\n2H2O2 (aq) â†’ 2H2O (l) + O2 (g)\n\nIn this reaction, potassium iodide (KI) acts as a catalyst, which speeds up the reaction without being consumed in the process. The reaction rate can be affected by various factors, including temperature, concentration, and light exposure.\n\n1. UV light: Ultraviolet (UV) light has higher energy than visible light, and it can break chemical bonds and initiate reactions. When hydrogen peroxide is exposed to UV light, it can decompose into water and oxygen more rapidly. The presence of potassium iodide as a catalyst further increases the reaction rate. Therefore, under UV light, the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide is expected to be faster compared to other light conditions.\n\n2. Visible light: Visible light has less energy than UV light, but it can still affect the reaction rate. The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide under visible light is slower than under UV light. However, the presence of potassium iodide as a catalyst can still increase the reaction rate compared to the reaction without a catalyst.\n\n3. Dark: In the absence of light, the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide is slower compared to when it is exposed to light. However, the presence of potassium iodide as a catalyst can still increase the reaction rate compared to the reaction without a catalyst.\n\nIn conclusion, the reaction rate of the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by potassium iodide is expected to be the fastest under UV light, followed by visible light, and slowest in the dark. However, the presence of potassium iodide as a catalyst will increase the reaction rate in all light conditions compared to the reaction without a catalyst."
