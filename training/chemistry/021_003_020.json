    "message_2": "To determine the predicted bond angle in a molecule of methane (CH4), we first need to examine its molecular geometry and hybridization.\n\nMolecular Geometry:\nMethane has a central carbon atom bonded to four hydrogen atoms. The electron domain geometry around the central carbon atom is tetrahedral, as there are four electron domains (four single bonds to hydrogen atoms).\n\nHybridization:\nThe central carbon atom in methane has four valence electrons, which are involved in forming four sigma bonds with the hydrogen atoms. To accommodate these four sigma bonds, the carbon atom undergoes sp3 hybridization, which means that one s orbital and three p orbitals combine to form four equivalent sp3 hybrid orbitals.\n\nBond Angle:\nIn a tetrahedral molecular geometry, the bond angles are determined by the repulsion between the electron domains (in this case, the four sigma bonds). According to the valence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory, the electron domains will arrange themselves to minimize repulsion, resulting in a bond angle of approximately 109.5 degrees.\n\nSo, the predicted bond angle in a molecule of methane (CH4) based on its molecular geometry and hybridization is approximately 109.5 degrees."
