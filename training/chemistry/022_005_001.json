    "message_2": "The balanced chemical equation for the complete combustion of pentane (C5H12) is:\n\nC5H12 + 8O2 â†’ 5CO2 + 6H2O\n\nThis equation shows that one mole of pentane reacts with eight moles of oxygen to produce five moles of carbon dioxide and six moles of water. Therefore, eight moles of oxygen are required to burn one mole of pentane completely."
