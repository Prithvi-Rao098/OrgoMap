    "message_1": "Calculate the standard enthalpy change for the sublimation of iodine at 25°C, given that the standard enthalpy of fusion of iodine is 15.7 kJ/mol and the standard enthalpy of vaporization of iodine is 41.0 kJ/mol. (The molar mass of iodine is 126.90 g/mol)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the sublimation of iodine at 25°C, we need to consider the two processes involved in sublimation: fusion (melting) and vaporization. The enthalpy change for sublimation is the sum of the enthalpy changes for these two processes.\n\nΔH_sublimation = ΔH_fusion + ΔH_vaporization\n\nGiven that the standard enthalpy of fusion of iodine is 15.7 kJ/mol and the standard enthalpy of vaporization of iodine is 41.0 kJ/mol, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔH_sublimation = 15.7 kJ/mol + 41.0 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_sublimation = 56.7 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the sublimation of iodine at 25°C is 56.7 kJ/mol."
