    "message_2": "The problem asks for the standard enthalpy change for the fusion of 1 mole of solid water (ice) at 0°C to liquid water at 0°C. We are given the enthalpy of fusion of solid water as 6.01 kJ/mol and the specific heat capacity of water as 4.18 J/g°C.\n\nSince the temperature remains constant at 0°C during the fusion process, we do not need to consider the specific heat capacity of water in this calculation. The enthalpy change for the fusion of 1 mole of ice to liquid water at 0°C is simply equal to the enthalpy of fusion of solid water.\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the fusion of 1 mole of solid water (ice) at 0°C to liquid water at 0°C is 6.01 kJ/mol."
