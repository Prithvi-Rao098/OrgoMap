    "message_2": "To determine the chemical structure of a compound containing a methyl group based on NMR spectrum data, you would need to provide the specific NMR data, including chemical shifts (in ppm) and coupling constants (in Hz) for both 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR, if available. Additionally, information from other NMR techniques, such as DEPT, COSY, HSQC, and HMBC, can be helpful in solving the structure.\n\nOnce the NMR data is provided, the chemical shifts and coupling constants can be analyzed to identify the functional groups, the connectivity of the atoms, and the overall structure of the compound."
