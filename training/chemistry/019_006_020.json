    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction, we can use the formula:\n\nKc = [Products]^coefficients / [Reactants]^coefficients\n\nFor the reaction H2(g) + Br2(g) ⇌ 2HBr(g), the formula becomes:\n\nKc = [HBr]^2 / ([H2] * [Br2])\n\nGiven the concentrations at equilibrium, we can plug in the values:\n\nKc = (0.08)^2 / (0.02 * 0.03)\n\nKc = 0.0064 / 0.0006\n\nKc ≈ 10.67\n\nThe equilibrium constant for the reaction at 298 K is approximately 10.67."
