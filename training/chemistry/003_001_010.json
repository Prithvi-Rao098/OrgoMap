    "message_2": "To find the change in enthalpy (ΔH) for the combustion of 2 moles of methane (CH4) gas at standard conditions, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane:\n\nCH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l)\n\nNext, we need to find the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) for each substance involved in the reaction. The standard enthalpies of formation are as follows:\n\nΔHf°(CH4) = -74.8 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(O2) = 0 kJ/mol (since O2 is in its standard state)\nΔHf°(CO2) = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(H2O) = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the change in enthalpy (ΔH) for the reaction using the following formula:\n\nΔH = Σ [ΔHf°(products)] - Σ [ΔHf°(reactants)]\n\nΔH = [1 mol × (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 mol × (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [1 mol × (-74.8 kJ/mol) + 2 mol × 0 kJ/mol]\n\nΔH = (-393.5 kJ + 2 × -285.8 kJ) - (-74.8 kJ)\n\nΔH = (-393.5 kJ - 571.6 kJ) + 74.8 kJ\n\nΔH = -890.3 kJ\n\nHowever, this is the change in enthalpy for the combustion of 1 mole of methane. Since we are asked for the change in enthalpy for the combustion of 2 moles of methane, we need to multiply the result by 2:\n\nΔH (2 moles of CH4) = 2 × -890.3 kJ = -1780.6 kJ\n\nSo, the change in enthalpy (ΔH) for the combustion of 2 moles of methane (CH4) gas at standard conditions is -1780.6 kJ."
