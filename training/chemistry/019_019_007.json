    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the given reaction, we can use the equation:\n\nΔH° = Σ [ΔHf° (products)] - Σ [ΔHf° (reactants)]\n\nFor the reaction 2 SO2(g) + O2(g) → 2 SO3(g), we have:\n\nΔH° = [2 × ΔHf° (SO3)] - [2 × ΔHf° (SO2) + ΔHf° (O2)]\n\nSince O2 is an element in its standard state, its enthalpy of formation is 0 kJ/mol. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\nΔH° = [2 × (-396.2 kJ/mol)] - [2 × (-296.8 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH° = (-792.4 kJ) - (-593.6 kJ)\n\nΔH° = -198.8 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the reaction is -198.8 kJ."
