    "message_2": "Benzene (C6H6) is an aromatic compound with a hexagonal ring structure consisting of six carbon atoms and six hydrogen atoms. The carbon atoms are sp2 hybridized, and each carbon atom forms three sigma bonds: one with a hydrogen atom and two with adjacent carbon atoms. The remaining unhybridized p-orbital on each carbon atom contains one electron.\n\nThere are two resonance structures for benzene, which can be represented as follows:\n\n1. Structure 1: The double bonds are located between C1-C2, C3-C4, and C5-C6.\n2. Structure 2: The double bonds are located between C2-C3, C4-C5, and C6-C1.\n\nThese two resonance structures can be represented by a single structure with a circle inside the hexagon, indicating the delocalization of the pi electrons over all six carbon atoms.\n\nThe delocalization of electrons in benzene occurs due to the overlapping of the p-orbitals of the carbon atoms, which creates a continuous pi electron cloud above and below the plane of the carbon atoms. This delocalization of electrons provides benzene with its characteristic stability and aromaticity."
