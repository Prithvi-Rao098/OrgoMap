    "message_2": "The preparation of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline from aniline and chlorine gas involves a two-step process: nitration of aniline followed by chlorination of the resulting 4-nitroaniline. Here's the step-by-step procedure:\n\nStep 1: Nitration of aniline\n1. Dissolve 10 g of aniline in 50 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl) to form anilinium chloride.\n2. Cool the solution in an ice bath to maintain a temperature below 5°C.\n3. Slowly add a nitrating mixture of 25 mL concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and 25 mL concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) to the anilinium chloride solution, while maintaining the temperature below 5°C.\n4. Stir the reaction mixture for 30 minutes, maintaining the temperature below 5°C.\n5. Pour the reaction mixture into 200 mL of crushed ice and water, and allow the precipitate to form.\n6. Filter the precipitate and wash it with cold water to obtain crude 4-nitroaniline.\n7. Recrystallize the crude 4-nitroaniline from hot water to obtain pure 4-nitroaniline.\n\nStep 2: Chlorination of 4-nitroaniline\n1. Dissolve 10 g of 4-nitroaniline in 100 mL of glacial acetic acid.\n2. Cool the solution in an ice bath to maintain a temperature below 5°C.\n3. Slowly bubble chlorine gas (Cl2) into the solution, while maintaining the temperature below 5°C, until the solution turns yellowish-green.\n4. Stir the reaction mixture for 30 minutes, maintaining the temperature below 5°C.\n5. Pour the reaction mixture into 200 mL of crushed ice and water, and allow the precipitate to form.\n6. Filter the precipitate and wash it with cold water to obtain crude 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline.\n7. Recrystallize the crude 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline from hot water to obtain pure 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline.\n\nSafety measures:\n1. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment, including gloves, goggles, and a lab coat.\n2. Perform the experiment in a well-ventilated area or under a fume hood, as chlorine gas is toxic and corrosive.\n3. Be cautious when handling concentrated acids, as they can cause severe burns.\n\nExpected yield:\nThe yield of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline depends on the efficiency of the nitration and chlorination steps. Typically, the yield for nitration is around 70-80%, and the yield for chlorination is around 60-70%. Overall, the expected yield for the synthesis of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline from aniline is approximately 40-50%."
