    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the vaporization of 25 grams of water, we need to first determine the number of moles of water and then use the given standard enthalpy of vaporization.\n\n1. Calculate the number of moles of water:\nThe molar mass of water (H2O) is 18.015 g/mol (1.008 g/mol for hydrogen and 15.999 g/mol for oxygen).\nNumber of moles = mass / molar mass\nNumber of moles = 25 g / 18.015 g/mol = 1.387 moles\n\n2. Calculate the standard enthalpy change:\nStandard enthalpy change = number of moles × standard enthalpy of vaporization\nStandard enthalpy change = 1.387 moles × 40.7 kJ/mol = 56.47 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the vaporization of 25 grams of water at 100°C and 1 atm pressure is approximately 56.47 kJ."
