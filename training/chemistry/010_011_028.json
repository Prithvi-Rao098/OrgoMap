    "message_2": "To calculate the efficiency of an electrochemical cell, we need to determine the actual amount of metal deposited on the electrodes and compare it to the theoretical amount that should be deposited based on the current and duration of the experiment.\n\nFirst, let's find the charge (Q) passed through the cell:\nQ = current × time\nQ = 2 mA × 3 hours\nQ = 2 × 10⁻³ A × 3 × 3600 s (1 hour = 3600 seconds)\nQ = 21.6 C (Coulombs)\n\nNow, let's find the theoretical amount of metal deposited using Faraday's law of electrolysis:\nM = (Q × Molar mass) / (n × F)\n\nFor Cu²⁺ (copper):\nn = 2 (Cu²⁺ has a charge of +2)\nMolar mass = 63.5 g/mol\nF = Faraday's constant = 96485 C/mol\n\nM_Cu = (21.6 C × 63.5 g/mol) / (2 × 96485 C/mol)\nM_Cu = 0.0071 g\n\nFor Ag⁺ (silver):\nn = 1 (Ag⁺ has a charge of +1)\nMolar mass = 107.9 g/mol\n\nM_Ag = (21.6 C × 107.9 g/mol) / (1 × 96485 C/mol)\nM_Ag = 0.024 g\n\nNow, let's find the actual amount of metal deposited. We'll assume that the cell is 100% efficient, meaning that all the current goes into depositing the metals. In this case, the actual amount of metal deposited is equal to the theoretical amount.\n\nActual M_Cu = 0.0071 g\nActual M_Ag = 0.024 g\n\nTo find the efficiency of the cell, we'll compare the actual amount of metal deposited to the theoretical amount:\n\nEfficiency = (Actual amount of metal deposited / Theoretical amount of metal deposited) × 100\n\nEfficiency_Cu = (0.0071 g / 0.0071 g) × 100 = 100%\nEfficiency_Ag = (0.024 g / 0.024 g) × 100 = 100%\n\nSince both copper and silver have 100% efficiency, the overall efficiency of the electrochemical cell is 100%."
