    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of oxidation of methane gas (CH4), we need to consider the balanced chemical equation for the complete combustion of methane:\n\nCH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l)\n\nNow, we can use Hess's Law to calculate the enthalpy change for this reaction. The enthalpy change for the reaction (ΔH) is equal to the sum of the enthalpies of formation of the products minus the sum of the enthalpies of formation of the reactants:\n\nΔH = [ΔHf(CO2) + 2 * ΔHf(H2O)] - [ΔHf(CH4) + 2 * ΔHf(O2)]\n\nSince O2 is in its standard state, its enthalpy of formation is 0 kJ/mol. Now, we can plug in the given values:\n\nΔH = [(-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 * (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [(-74.8 kJ/mol) + 2 * (0 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH = (-393.5 - 571.6 + 74.8) kJ/mol\n\nΔH = -890.3 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the enthalpy of oxidation of methane gas (CH4) at standard conditions is -890.3 kJ/mol."
