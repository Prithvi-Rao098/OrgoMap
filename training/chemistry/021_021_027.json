    "message_2": "Ethene (C2H4) is an organic molecule with a double bond between the two carbon atoms. To determine the hybrid orbital types present in this molecule, we need to examine the electron configuration and bonding of the carbon atoms.\n\nEach carbon atom in ethene has four valence electrons, and they form bonds with two hydrogen atoms and one other carbon atom. The carbon-carbon double bond consists of one sigma (σ) bond and one pi (π) bond. The sigma bond is formed by the overlap of hybrid orbitals, while the pi bond is formed by the overlap of unhybridized p orbitals.\n\nTo accommodate the three electron domains (two single bonds to hydrogen and one sigma bond to another carbon), carbon atoms in ethene use three of their valence electrons to form sp2 hybrid orbitals. The remaining valence electron occupies an unhybridized p orbital, which is involved in the formation of the pi bond.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of the hybrid orbitals in ethene:\n\n1. sp2 hybrid orbitals: Each carbon atom forms three sp2 hybrid orbitals by mixing one s orbital and two p orbitals. These sp2 orbitals are involved in forming sigma bonds with two hydrogen atoms and the other carbon atom. The sp2 hybrid orbitals are planar and have bond angles of approximately 120°.\n\n2. Unhybridized p orbital: The remaining p orbital on each carbon atom does not participate in hybridization. These unhybridized p orbitals are perpendicular to the plane of the sp2 orbitals and overlap side-by-side to form the pi bond in the carbon-carbon double bond.\n\nIn summary, the hybrid orbital types present in the ethene molecule are sp2 hybrid orbitals for the sigma bonds and unhybridized p orbitals for the pi bond in the carbon-carbon double bond."
