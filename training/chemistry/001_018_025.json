    "message_2": "The pKa value of acetic acid (CH3COOH) is approximately 4.76.\n\nTo calculate the pH of a 0.1 M acetic acid solution in equilibrium with its conjugate base (acetate ion), we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log ([A-]/[HA])\n\nwhere pH is the solution's pH, pKa is the acid dissociation constant, [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate ion), and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid (acetic acid).\n\nIn this case, since the solution is in equilibrium, the concentration of acetic acid and acetate ion will be equal. Therefore, the ratio [A-]/[HA] will be 1.\n\npH = 4.76 + log (1)\npH = 4.76 + 0\npH = 4.76\n\nSo, the pH of a 0.1 M acetic acid solution in equilibrium with its conjugate base is approximately 4.76."
