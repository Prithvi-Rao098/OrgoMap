    "message_2": "To calculate the surface tension of water using the capillary rise method, we can use the Jurin's Law formula:\n\nh = (2 * S * cosθ) / (ρ * g * r)\n\nwhere:\nh = height of the water column (2.8 cm)\nS = surface tension (in dynes/cm, which we want to find)\nθ = contact angle between the water and the capillary tube (for water and glass, it is approximately 0°, so cosθ = 1)\nρ = density of water (1 g/cm³)\ng = acceleration due to gravity (980 cm/s²)\nr = radius of the capillary tube (0.5 mm = 0.05 cm)\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for S, we get:\n\nS = (h * ρ * g * r) / (2 * cosθ)\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nS = (2.8 cm * 1 g/cm³ * 980 cm/s² * 0.05 cm) / (2 * 1)\n\nS = (137.2 dynes) / 2\n\nS ≈ 68.6 dynes/cm\n\nThe surface tension of water in this experiment is approximately 68.6 dynes/cm."
