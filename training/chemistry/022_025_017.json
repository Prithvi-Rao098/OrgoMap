    "message_1": "What is the concentration (in mol/L) of a hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution if 25 mL of this solution requires 35 mL of a 0.1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution to reach the equivalence point in a titration reaction?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of stoichiometry and the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH):\n\nHCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H2O(l)\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that the mole ratio between HCl and NaOH is 1:1.\n\nFirst, let's find the moles of NaOH used in the reaction:\n\nmoles of NaOH = (volume of NaOH) × (concentration of NaOH)\nmoles of NaOH = (35 mL) × (0.1 mol/L)\n\nSince 1 L = 1000 mL, we need to convert the volume to liters:\n\nmoles of NaOH = (0.035 L) × (0.1 mol/L)\nmoles of NaOH = 0.0035 mol\n\nSince the mole ratio between HCl and NaOH is 1:1, the moles of HCl are equal to the moles of NaOH:\n\nmoles of HCl = 0.0035 mol\n\nNow, we can find the concentration of HCl using the formula:\n\nconcentration of HCl = (moles of HCl) / (volume of HCl)\n\nFirst, convert the volume of HCl to liters:\n\nvolume of HCl = 25 mL = 0.025 L\n\nNow, calculate the concentration of HCl:\n\nconcentration of HCl = (0.0035 mol) / (0.025 L)\nconcentration of HCl = 0.14 mol/L\n\nSo, the concentration of the hydrochloric acid solution is 0.14 mol/L."
