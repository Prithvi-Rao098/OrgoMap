    "message_2": "To calculate the theoretical yield of 2,4-dinitrophenol, we first need to determine the balanced chemical equation for the reaction. For simplicity, let's assume the reaction is as follows:\n\nPhenol (C6H5OH) + 2 HNO3 â†’ 2,4-Dinitrophenol (C6H3(NO2)2OH) + H2O\n\nNext, we need to find the molar mass of phenol and 2,4-dinitrophenol:\n\nPhenol (C6H5OH): (6 * 12.01) + (6 * 1.01) + 16.00 = 94.11 g/mol\n2,4-Dinitrophenol (C6H3(NO2)2OH): (6 * 12.01) + (3 * 1.01) + (2 * (14.01 + 2 * 16.00)) + 16.00 = 184.11 g/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the moles of phenol used:\n\nmoles of phenol = mass of phenol / molar mass of phenol\nmoles of phenol = 10 g / 94.11 g/mol = 0.106 mol\n\nAccording to the balanced equation, 1 mole of phenol produces 1 mole of 2,4-dinitrophenol. Therefore, the theoretical yield of 2,4-dinitrophenol is:\n\nmoles of 2,4-dinitrophenol = 0.106 mol\nmass of 2,4-dinitrophenol = moles of 2,4-dinitrophenol * molar mass of 2,4-dinitrophenol\nmass of 2,4-dinitrophenol = 0.106 mol * 184.11 g/mol = 19.52 g\n\nHowever, the problem states that the yield is 85%. To find the actual yield, we multiply the theoretical yield by the percentage yield:\n\nactual yield = theoretical yield * percentage yield\nactual yield = 19.52 g * 0.85 = 16.59 g\n\nSo, the theoretical yield of 2,4-dinitrophenol is 19.52 g, and the actual yield obtained is 16.59 g."
