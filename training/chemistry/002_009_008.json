    "message_2": "To determine the empirical formula of the compound, we need to find the simplest whole number ratio of moles of iron (Fe) to moles of sulfur (S).\n\n1. Assume we have 100 grams of the compound. This means we have 72.4 grams of iron and 27.6 grams of sulfur.\n\n2. Convert the mass of each element to moles using their molar masses:\n- Molar mass of iron (Fe) = 55.85 g/mol\n- Molar mass of sulfur (S) = 32.07 g/mol\n\nMoles of Fe = (72.4 g) / (55.85 g/mol) = 1.296 moles\nMoles of S = (27.6 g) / (32.07 g/mol) = 0.860 moles\n\n3. Divide both mole values by the smallest value to find the mole ratio:\nMole ratio of Fe to S = (1.296 moles / 0.860 moles) : (0.860 moles / 0.860 moles) = 1.51 : 1\n\n4. Round the mole ratio to the nearest whole number:\nMole ratio of Fe to S = 2 : 1\n\nSo, the empirical formula of the compound is Feâ‚‚S."
