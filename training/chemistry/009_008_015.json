    "message_2": "To calculate the efficiency of the radiation detector, we need to first determine the total number of counts recorded by the detector and the total number of particles emitted by the radioactive source.\n\n1. Total counts recorded by the detector:\nCounts per minute = 800 counts\nExposure time = 10 minutes\nTotal counts = Counts per minute × Exposure time\nTotal counts = 800 counts/minute × 10 minutes = 8000 counts\n\n2. Total particles emitted by the radioactive source:\nActivity of the source = 2 µCi (microcuries)\nKnown activity = 3 µCi (microcuries)\nConversion factor: 1 µCi = 3.7 × 10^4 disintegrations per minute (dpm)\n\nActual activity of the source in dpm = Activity of the source × Conversion factor\nActual activity = 2 µCi × 3.7 × 10^4 dpm/µCi = 7.4 × 10^4 dpm\n\nTotal particles emitted during exposure time = Actual activity × Exposure time\nTotal particles emitted = 7.4 × 10^4 dpm × 10 minutes = 7.4 × 10^5 particles\n\n3. Efficiency of the radiation detector:\nEfficiency = (Total counts recorded by the detector / Total particles emitted) × 100%\nEfficiency = (8000 counts / 7.4 × 10^5 particles) × 100%\nEfficiency ≈ 1.08%\n\nThe efficiency of the radiation detector is approximately 1.08%."
