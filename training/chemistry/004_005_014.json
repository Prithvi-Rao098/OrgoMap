    "message_2": "To calculate the pH of a 0.1 M hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution, we can use the formula:\n\npH = -log10[H+]\n\nHydrochloric acid is a strong acid, meaning it dissociates completely in water to form H+ and Cl- ions. In this case, the concentration of H+ ions is equal to the concentration of the HCl solution, which is 0.1 M.\n\nSo, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\npH = -log10(0.1)\n\npH = -(-1)\n\npH = 1\n\nTherefore, the pH of a 0.1 M hydrochloric acid solution when measured with a pH meter at 25°C is 1."
