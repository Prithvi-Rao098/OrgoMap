    "message_2": "The concentration of the pesticide residue Chlorpyrifos in commercially available apples can vary depending on the country, region, and specific farming practices. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set a tolerance level for Chlorpyrifos residues in apples at 0.01 parts per million (ppm) or 10 parts per billion (ppb).\n\nThe potential health impacts of consuming apples with Chlorpyrifos residues on a daily basis depend on the concentration of the pesticide and the individual's susceptibility to its effects. Chlorpyrifos is a neurotoxic pesticide that can affect the nervous system by inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, which is essential for the proper functioning of the nervous system.\n\nShort-term exposure to high levels of Chlorpyrifos can cause symptoms such as nausea, dizziness, headaches, and muscle twitching. Long-term exposure to lower levels of the pesticide can lead to more severe health effects, including developmental delays, cognitive impairments, and behavioral issues.\n\nFor most adults, consuming apples with Chlorpyrifos residues at or below the EPA's tolerance level is unlikely to cause significant health problems. However, certain populations, such as pregnant women, infants, and young children, may be more susceptible to the harmful effects of Chlorpyrifos. Additionally, individuals who consume large quantities of apples or other fruits and vegetables with pesticide residues may be at a higher risk of experiencing adverse health effects.\n\nTo minimize the potential health risks associated with pesticide residues, it is recommended to wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly before consumption, and to consider purchasing organic produce when possible."
