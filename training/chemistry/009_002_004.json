    "message_1": "What is the half-life of Thorium-230 in the radioactive decay series of Uranium-238, if it undergoes alpha decay to produce Radium-226? Given the initial amount of Thorium-230 present is 4 milligrams, and after 12.5 days only 1 milligram of Thorium-230 remains.",
    "message_2": "To determine the half-life of Thorium-230, we can use the half-life formula:\n\nN = N0 * (1/2)^(t/T)\n\nwhere:\nN = the final amount of Thorium-230 remaining (1 mg)\nN0 = the initial amount of Thorium-230 (4 mg)\nt = the time elapsed (12.5 days)\nT = the half-life of Thorium-230 (which we want to find)\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for T, we get:\n\nT = t / (log2(N0/N))\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nT = 12.5 days / (log2(4/1))\n\nT = 12.5 days / (log2(4))\n\nT = 12.5 days / 2\n\nT = 6.25 days\n\nThe half-life of Thorium-230 in the radioactive decay series of Uranium-238 is 6.25 days."
