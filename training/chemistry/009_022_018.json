    "message_2": "External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for prostate cancer using high-energy photons typically involves delivering a total absorbed dose of radiation to the tumor in the range of 70-80 Gray (Gy), divided into smaller doses called fractions, usually given over 7-9 weeks. The minimum and maximum absorbed doses can vary depending on the specific treatment plan, the type of radiation therapy used (such as 3D conformal radiation therapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy, or stereotactic body radiation therapy), and the individual patient's anatomy and tumor characteristics.\n\nThe absorbed dose limit for normal tissue adjacent to the prostate gland, such as the rectum and bladder, is generally lower than the dose delivered to the tumor. The goal of radiation therapy is to maximize the dose to the tumor while minimizing the dose to the surrounding healthy tissue. The dose constraints for normal tissue depend on the specific organ and the volume of the organ receiving a certain dose. For example, the dose constraint for the rectum is typically around 50-60 Gy for a certain volume (e.g., no more than 50% of the rectum should receive more than 50 Gy), while the dose constraint for the bladder is around 65 Gy for a certain volume (e.g., no more than 50% of the bladder should receive more than 65 Gy).\n\nIn summary, the minimum and maximum absorbed doses for a patient receiving external beam radiation therapy for prostate cancer using high-energy photons are typically in the range of 70-80 Gy, while the absorbed dose limits for the normal tissue adjacent to the prostate gland are lower, generally around 50-65 Gy depending on the specific organ and volume. The goal of treatment planning is to optimize the dose distribution to achieve the desired tumor control while minimizing the risk of side effects and complications related to radiation exposure to the surrounding healthy tissue."
