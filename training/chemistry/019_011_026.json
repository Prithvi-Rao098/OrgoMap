    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change of formation for methane (CH4), we can use the following combustion reaction:\n\nCH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(l)\n\nThe enthalpy change for this reaction is given as -890.4 kJ/mol. We can use Hess's Law to find the enthalpy change of formation for methane. According to Hess's Law, the enthalpy change of a reaction is the sum of the enthalpy changes of formation of the products minus the sum of the enthalpy changes of formation of the reactants.\n\nΔH(reaction) = Σ ΔHf(products) - Σ ΔHf(reactants)\n\nWe are given the standard enthalpy change of formation for CO2 (-393.5 kJ/mol) and H2O (-285.8 kJ/mol). The enthalpy change of formation for O2 is 0 kJ/mol since it is an element in its standard state. We can now plug in the values into the equation:\n\n-890.4 kJ/mol = [(-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2(-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [ΔHf(CH4) + 2(0 kJ/mol)]\n\n-890.4 kJ/mol = -393.5 kJ/mol - 571.6 kJ/mol - ΔHf(CH4)\n\nNow, solve for ΔHf(CH4):\n\nΔHf(CH4) = -393.5 kJ/mol - 571.6 kJ/mol + 890.4 kJ/mol\nΔHf(CH4) = -74.7 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change of formation for methane (CH4) is -74.7 kJ/mol."
