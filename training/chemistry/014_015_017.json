    "message_2": "Cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) is a metalloenzyme that plays a crucial role in the respiratory process of living organisms. The active site of CcO contains two metal ions: a copper ion (CuB) and a heme iron (Fea3).\n\nThe coordination geometry of the heme iron (Fea3) is typically square pyramidal. The iron is coordinated to a histidine residue, a porphyrin ring, and a water molecule or hydroxide ion. The copper ion (CuB) has a distorted tetrahedral coordination geometry, being coordinated to three histidine residues and a water molecule or hydroxide ion.\n\nThe oxidation state of the heme iron (Fea3) in the active site of cytochrome c oxidase can vary between +2 (ferrous) and +3 (ferric) during the catalytic cycle. The copper ion (CuB) also undergoes redox changes, with its oxidation state varying between +1 (cuprous) and +2 (cupric)."
