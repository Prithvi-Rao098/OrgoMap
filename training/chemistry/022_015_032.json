    "message_1": "What is the percent yield of carbon dioxide if 25 grams of magnesium carbonate react with excess hydrochloric acid, and 7.5 grams of carbon dioxide are produced? The theoretical yield of carbon dioxide for this reaction is 10 grams.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the percent yield of carbon dioxide, you can use the following formula:\n\nPercent Yield = (Actual Yield / Theoretical Yield) x 100\n\nIn this case, the actual yield is 7.5 grams of carbon dioxide, and the theoretical yield is 10 grams.\n\nPercent Yield = (7.5 / 10) x 100 = 0.75 x 100 = 75%\n\nThe percent yield of carbon dioxide in this reaction is 75%."
