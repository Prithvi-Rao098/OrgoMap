    "message_1": "What mass of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine can be produced from 5.0 grams of hydrazine and excess 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene if the yield is 85%?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use stoichiometry and the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between hydrazine (N2H4) and 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (C6H3ClN2O4) to produce 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (C6H6N4O4) and hydrochloric acid (HCl).\n\nThe balanced chemical equation is:\n\nN2H4 + C6H3ClN2O4 → C6H6N4O4 + HCl\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the moles of hydrazine (N2H4) using its molar mass:\n\nMolar mass of N2H4 = (2 × 14.01) + (4 × 1.01) = 32.05 g/mol\n\nMoles of N2H4 = mass / molar mass\nMoles of N2H4 = 5.0 g / 32.05 g/mol = 0.156 mol\n\nAccording to the balanced chemical equation, 1 mole of N2H4 reacts with 1 mole of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene to produce 1 mole of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine. Therefore, the moles of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine produced are equal to the moles of hydrazine used:\n\nMoles of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine = 0.156 mol\n\nNow, we need to calculate the mass of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine produced using its molar mass:\n\nMolar mass of C6H6N4O4 = (6 × 12.01) + (6 × 1.01) + (4 × 14.01) + (4 × 16.00) = 198.14 g/mol\n\nMass of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine = moles × molar mass\nMass of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine = 0.156 mol × 198.14 g/mol = 30.91 g\n\nHowever, the yield of the reaction is 85%, so we need to adjust the mass of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine accordingly:\n\nActual mass of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine = 30.91 g × 0.85 = 26.27 g\n\nSo, 26.27 grams of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine can be produced from 5.0 grams of hydrazine and excess 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene if the yield is 85%."
