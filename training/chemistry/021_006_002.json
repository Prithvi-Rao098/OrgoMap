    "message_2": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a linear molecule with a carbon atom in the center and two oxygen atoms on either side. The carbon atom forms double bonds with each oxygen atom. \n\nTo predict the dipole moment of a molecule, we need to consider the electronegativity values of the atoms involved and the molecular geometry. Electronegativity is a measure of the tendency of an atom to attract a bonding pair of electrons. In CO2, the electronegativity values are as follows:\n\n- Carbon (C): 2.55\n- Oxygen (O): 3.44\n\nSince oxygen is more electronegative than carbon, the electrons in the C=O bonds will be attracted more towards the oxygen atoms, creating bond dipoles. However, due to the linear geometry of the CO2 molecule, these bond dipoles are exactly opposite to each other and have the same magnitude. As a result, they cancel each other out.\n\nTherefore, the net dipole moment of a carbon dioxide molecule is 0 Debye. This means that CO2 is a nonpolar molecule, despite having polar C=O bonds, because the bond dipoles cancel each other out due to the molecule's linear geometry."
