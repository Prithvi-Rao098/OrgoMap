    "message_2": "The standard enthalpy change for the phase transition from liquid water to steam at 100°C and 1 atm pressure is equal to the molar heat of vaporization of water. In this case, the molar heat of vaporization is given as 40.7 kJ/mol. Therefore, the standard enthalpy change for this phase transition is:\n\nΔH = 40.7 kJ/mol"
