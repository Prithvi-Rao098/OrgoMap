    "message_2": "To determine the pH of a 0.1 M hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution, we can use the formula:\n\npH = -log10[H+]\n\nHydrochloric acid is a strong acid, which means it completely dissociates in water:\n\nHCl â†’ H+ + Cl-\n\nIn a 0.1 M HCl solution, the concentration of H+ ions is also 0.1 M. Now we can use the formula to calculate the pH:\n\npH = -log10(0.1)\npH = -(-1)\npH = 1\n\nSo, the pH of a 0.1 M hydrochloric acid solution is 1. However, to measure the pH using a pH meter, you would need to calibrate the meter and then immerse the electrode in the solution to obtain the pH reading. The pH meter should give you a reading close to 1 for a 0.1 M HCl solution."
