    "message_2": "To calculate the molar mass of sodium chloride (NaCl), we need to find the molar mass of each element (sodium and chlorine) and then add them together. \n\nStep 1: Find the molar mass of sodium (Na)\nThe molar mass of sodium can be found on the periodic table. Sodium has an atomic mass of approximately 22.99 g/mol.\n\nStep 2: Find the molar mass of chlorine (Cl)\nThe molar mass of chlorine can also be found on the periodic table. Chlorine has an atomic mass of approximately 35.45 g/mol.\n\nStep 3: Add the molar masses of sodium and chlorine together\nMolar mass of NaCl = (molar mass of Na) + (molar mass of Cl)\nMolar mass of NaCl = 22.99 g/mol + 35.45 g/mol\nMolar mass of NaCl = 58.44 g/mol\n\nSo, the molar mass of sodium chloride (NaCl) is approximately 58.44 g/mol."
