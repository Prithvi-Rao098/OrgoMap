    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the melting of 10 grams of ice at -10°C to liquid water at 20°C, we need to consider three steps:\n\n1. Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C.\n2. Melting the ice at 0°C.\n3. Heating the liquid water from 0°C to 20°C.\n\nStep 1: Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C\nq1 = mass x specific heat capacity of ice x temperature change\nq1 = 10 g x 2.09 J/g°C x (0 - (-10))°C\nq1 = 10 g x 2.09 J/g°C x 10°C\nq1 = 209 J\n\nStep 2: Melting the ice at 0°C\nFirst, we need to find the moles of ice:\nMolar mass of water (H2O) = 18.015 g/mol\nmoles = mass / molar mass\nmoles = 10 g / 18.015 g/mol\nmoles = 0.555 mol\n\nNow, we can find the enthalpy change for melting the ice:\nq2 = moles x enthalpy of fusion\nq2 = 0.555 mol x 6.01 kJ/mol\nq2 = 3.334 kJ\nConvert to Joules:\nq2 = 3.334 kJ x 1000 J/kJ\nq2 = 3334 J\n\nStep 3: Heating the liquid water from 0°C to 20°C\nq3 = mass x specific heat capacity of water x temperature change\nq3 = 10 g x 4.18 J/g°C x (20 - 0)°C\nq3 = 10 g x 4.18 J/g°C x 20°C\nq3 = 836 J\n\nNow, we can find the total enthalpy change by adding the enthalpy changes for each step:\nTotal enthalpy change = q1 + q2 + q3\nTotal enthalpy change = 209 J + 3334 J + 836 J\nTotal enthalpy change = 4379 J\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the melting of 10 grams of ice at -10°C to liquid water at 20°C is 4379 J."
