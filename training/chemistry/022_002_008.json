    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the stoichiometry method. First, we need to find the molar mass of each compound involved in the reaction.\n\nCopper(II) sulfate (CuSO4):\nCu = 63.55 g/mol\nS = 32.07 g/mol\nO4 = 4 * 16.00 g/mol = 64.00 g/mol\nMolar mass of CuSO4 = 63.55 + 32.07 + 64.00 = 159.62 g/mol\n\nCopper(II) hydroxide (Cu(OH)2):\nCu = 63.55 g/mol\nO2 = 2 * 16.00 g/mol = 32.00 g/mol\nH4 = 4 * 1.01 g/mol = 4.04 g/mol\nMolar mass of Cu(OH)2 = 63.55 + 32.00 + 4.04 = 99.59 g/mol\n\nNow, we will use the stoichiometry of the balanced equation to find the mass of copper(II) sulfate needed to produce 12 grams of copper(II) hydroxide.\n\n1 mol CuSO4 / 1 mol Cu(OH)2\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of copper(II) hydroxide to moles:\n12 g Cu(OH)2 * (1 mol Cu(OH)2 / 99.59 g Cu(OH)2) = 0.1204 mol Cu(OH)2\n\nNow, we can find the moles of copper(II) sulfate needed:\n0.1204 mol Cu(OH)2 * (1 mol CuSO4 / 1 mol Cu(OH)2) = 0.1204 mol CuSO4\n\nFinally, we can convert the moles of copper(II) sulfate to mass:\n0.1204 mol CuSO4 * (159.62 g CuSO4 / 1 mol CuSO4) = 19.21 g CuSO4\n\nTherefore, 19.21 grams of copper(II) sulfate are needed to react with an excess of sodium hydroxide to produce 12 grams of copper(II) hydroxide."
