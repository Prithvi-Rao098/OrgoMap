    "message_2": "To synthesize aspirin with maximum yield, you need to use stoichiometric amounts of salicylic acid and acetic anhydride. The balanced chemical equation for the synthesis of aspirin is:\n\nC7H6O3 (salicylic acid) + C4H6O3 (acetic anhydride) → C9H8O4 (aspirin) + C2H4O2 (acetic acid)\n\nFrom the equation, you can see that one mole of salicylic acid reacts with one mole of acetic anhydride to produce one mole of aspirin. To determine the optimal amounts, you need to know the amount of aspirin you want to synthesize.\n\nLet's say you want to synthesize 10 grams of aspirin. First, calculate the moles of aspirin:\n\nMoles of aspirin = mass (g) / molar mass (g/mol)\nMolar mass of aspirin (C9H8O4) = 180.16 g/mol\nMoles of aspirin = 10 g / 180.16 g/mol = 0.0555 mol\n\nSince the stoichiometry is 1:1, you need 0.0555 moles of both salicylic acid and acetic anhydride.\n\nNow, calculate the mass of salicylic acid and acetic anhydride needed:\n\nMolar mass of salicylic acid (C7H6O3) = 138.12 g/mol\nMass of salicylic acid = moles × molar mass = 0.0555 mol × 138.12 g/mol = 7.66 g\n\nMolar mass of acetic anhydride (C4H6O3) = 102.09 g/mol\nMass of acetic anhydride = moles × molar mass = 0.0555 mol × 102.09 g/mol = 5.67 g\n\nSo, the optimal amounts are 7.66 grams of salicylic acid and 5.67 grams of acetic anhydride to synthesize 10 grams of aspirin with maximum yield."
