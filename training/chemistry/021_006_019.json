    "message_2": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a linear molecule with a carbon atom in the center and an oxygen atom on each side. The electronegativity of carbon is 2.55, and the electronegativity of oxygen is 3.44. The difference in electronegativity between carbon and oxygen is 3.44 - 2.55 = 0.89.\n\nDipole moment (μ) is calculated using the formula:\n\nμ = bond length (d) × bond dipole (Q)\n\nThe bond length (d) between carbon and oxygen in CO2 is approximately 1.16 Å (1.16 × 10^-10 m). The bond dipole (Q) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nQ = charge (e) × electronegativity difference\n\nThe charge (e) of an electron is 1.6 × 10^-19 C. Therefore, the bond dipole (Q) is:\n\nQ = (1.6 × 10^-19 C) × 0.89 = 1.424 × 10^-19 C\n\nNow, we can calculate the dipole moment (μ) for one C=O bond:\n\nμ = (1.16 × 10^-10 m) × (1.424 × 10^-19 C) = 1.65 × 10^-29 Cm\n\nHowever, since CO2 is a linear molecule, the dipole moments of the two C=O bonds are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. This means that the overall dipole moment of the CO2 molecule is zero:\n\nμ_total = μ1 + μ2 = 1.65 × 10^-29 Cm - 1.65 × 10^-29 Cm = 0 Cm\n\nSince the overall dipole moment of the CO2 molecule is zero, it is a nonpolar molecule."
