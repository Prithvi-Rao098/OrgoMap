    "message_2": "In H2SO4, the oxidation state of the sulfur atom can be determined by considering the oxidation states of the other atoms in the compound. Hydrogen has an oxidation state of +1, and oxygen has an oxidation state of -2.\n\nLet the oxidation state of sulfur be x. The overall charge of the compound is neutral, so the sum of the oxidation states of all the atoms should be equal to zero.\n\n2(+1) + x + 4(-2) = 0\n\n2 + x - 8 = 0\n\nx - 6 = 0\n\nx = +6\n\nTherefore, the oxidation state of the sulfur atom in H2SO4 is +6."
