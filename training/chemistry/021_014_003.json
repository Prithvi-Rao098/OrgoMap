    "message_2": "The VSEPR geometry of a molecule with four bonded atoms and one lone pair of electrons on the central atom is called \"See-saw\" or \"Distorted tetrahedral\" geometry. This is because the presence of the lone pair pushes the bonded atoms away, causing a distortion in the tetrahedral arrangement."
