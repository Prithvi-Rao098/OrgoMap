    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction between potassium permanganate (KMnO₄) and sulfur dioxide (SO₂) in aqueous solution, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction. The reaction can be written as:\n\n2 KMnO₄ + 5 SO₂ + 2 H₂O → 2 MnSO₄ + K₂SO₄ + 5 H₂SO₄\n\nHowever, we cannot directly calculate the value of Kc without any experimental data or standard electrode potentials. Instead, we can use the Nernst equation to find the standard cell potential (E°) and then use it to calculate the equilibrium constant (Kc).\n\nThe Nernst equation is given by:\n\nE = E° - (RT/nF) * lnQ\n\nwhere E is the cell potential, E° is the standard cell potential, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin (298 K), n is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the reaction, F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol), and Q is the reaction quotient.\n\nTo find the standard cell potential (E°), we need the standard electrode potentials for the two half-reactions:\n\n1. Reduction of permanganate ion (MnO₄⁻) to manganese(II) ion (Mn²⁺):\nMnO₄⁻ + 8 H⁺ + 5 e⁻ → Mn²⁺ + 4 H₂O; E°₁ = 1.51 V\n\n2. Oxidation of sulfur dioxide (SO₂) to sulfate ion (SO₄²⁻):\n2 SO₂ + 2 H₂O → SO₄²⁻ + 4 H⁺ + 2 e⁻; E°₂ = -0.17 V\n\nNow, we can find the standard cell potential (E°) for the overall reaction by subtracting the standard electrode potential of the oxidation half-reaction from the standard electrode potential of the reduction half-reaction:\n\nE° = E°₁ - E°₂ = 1.51 V - (-0.17 V) = 1.68 V\n\nSince the Nernst equation relates the cell potential (E) to the equilibrium constant (Kc), we can rearrange the equation to solve for Kc:\n\nE = E° - (RT/nF) * lnQ\nAt equilibrium, E = 0 and Q = Kc, so:\n0 = E° - (RT/nF) * lnKc\n\nNow, we can solve for Kc:\n\nlnKc = (nFE°)/(RT)\nKc = e^((nFE°)/(RT))\n\nFor our reaction, n = 5 (5 moles of electrons are transferred in the reaction). Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nKc = e^((5 * 96,485 C/mol * 1.68 V) / (8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K))\nKc ≈ 2.17 × 10²³\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction between potassium permanganate (KMnO₄) and sulfur dioxide (SO₂) in aqueous solution at 298 K is approximately 2.17 × 10²³."
