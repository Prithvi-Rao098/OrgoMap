    "message_2": "The Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms are two widely used models to describe the adsorption of molecules onto surfaces in the context of heterogeneous catalysis. The main difference between these two models lies in the assumptions they make about the adsorption process and the surface properties.\n\n1. Langmuir Isotherm:\nThe Langmuir isotherm assumes that the surface is homogeneous, meaning that all adsorption sites on the surface are identical and have the same adsorption energy. It also assumes that there is no interaction between adsorbed molecules and that each adsorption site can only accommodate one adsorbed molecule. The Langmuir isotherm is represented by the following equation:\n\nθ = (K_P * P) / (1 + K_P * P)\n\nwhere θ is the fractional coverage of the surface, K_P is the Langmuir adsorption constant, and P is the partial pressure of the adsorbate.\n\n2. Freundlich Isotherm:\nThe Freundlich isotherm, on the other hand, assumes that the surface is heterogeneous, meaning that the adsorption sites have a distribution of adsorption energies. This model also assumes that the adsorption process is multilayer, allowing for multiple layers of adsorbed molecules on the surface. The Freundlich isotherm is represented by the following equation:\n\nq = K_F * P^(1/n)\n\nwhere q is the amount of adsorbed molecules per unit mass of the adsorbent, K_F is the Freundlich adsorption constant, P is the partial pressure of the adsorbate, and n is a constant related to the heterogeneity of the surface.\n\nIn summary, the main differences between the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms in the context of heterogeneous catalysis are the assumptions they make about the surface properties and the adsorption process. The Langmuir isotherm assumes a homogeneous surface with monolayer adsorption, while the Freundlich isotherm assumes a heterogeneous surface with multilayer adsorption."
