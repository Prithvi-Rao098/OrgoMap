    "message_2": "The effect of different wavelengths of light on the rate of the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) decomposition reaction can be explained by the concept of photochemistry. When light interacts with a chemical substance, it can cause the molecules to absorb energy, which can lead to changes in the molecular structure or cause the reaction to proceed at a different rate.\n\nIn the case of hydrogen peroxide, the decomposition reaction can be accelerated by exposure to light, particularly ultraviolet (UV) light. The reaction can be represented as:\n\n2 H2O2 → 2 H2O + O2\n\nWhen hydrogen peroxide absorbs light energy, particularly in the UV range (wavelengths between 100 and 400 nm), it can cause the O-O bond to break, forming two hydroxyl radicals (OH•). These radicals are highly reactive and can further react with other hydrogen peroxide molecules, leading to the production of water and oxygen gas.\n\nThe effect of different wavelengths of light on the rate of hydrogen peroxide decomposition can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. Ultraviolet (UV) light (100-400 nm): This range of wavelengths has the most significant effect on the decomposition rate, as it provides enough energy to break the O-O bond and generate highly reactive hydroxyl radicals.\n\n2. Visible light (400-700 nm): Visible light has a lower energy compared to UV light, and its effect on the decomposition rate is generally weaker. However, certain visible light wavelengths, particularly those in the blue-violet range (around 400-450 nm), can still cause some acceleration of the decomposition reaction.\n\n3. Infrared (IR) light (700 nm - 1 mm): Infrared light has even lower energy than visible light, and its effect on the hydrogen peroxide decomposition rate is negligible.\n\nIn summary, the rate of hydrogen peroxide decomposition is most significantly affected by exposure to ultraviolet light, with some effect from visible light (particularly blue-violet wavelengths), and negligible effect from infrared light."
