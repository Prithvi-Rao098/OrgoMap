    "message_1": "Calculate the number of electrons transferred when a solution containing 0.25 M Ni(NO3)2 is electrolyzed using a current of 0.50 A for 2.0 hours. The reaction taking place is Ni2+ (aq) + 2e- --> Ni (s).",
    "message_2": "To calculate the number of electrons transferred, we can use the formula:\n\nnumber of electrons = current (A) × time (s) / charge of one electron (C)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the time from hours to seconds:\n\n2.0 hours × 3600 seconds/hour = 7200 seconds\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nnumber of electrons = (0.50 A) × (7200 s) / (1.6 × 10^-19 C)\n\nnumber of electrons = 3600 C / (1.6 × 10^-19 C)\n\nnumber of electrons = 2.25 × 10^21 electrons\n\nSo, 2.25 × 10^21 electrons are transferred during the electrolysis of the 0.25 M Ni(NO3)2 solution using a current of 0.50 A for 2.0 hours."
