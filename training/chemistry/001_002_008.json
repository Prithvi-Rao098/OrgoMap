    "message_2": "Structural isomers and stereoisomers are two types of isomers found in organic compounds. Isomers are molecules with the same molecular formula but different arrangements of atoms or orientation in space.\n\n1. Structural isomers (also known as constitutional isomers) have the same molecular formula but different connectivity of atoms. This means that the atoms are bonded together in a different order, resulting in different structures with distinct physical and chemical properties.\n\nExample: C4H10 has two structural isomers: n-butane and isobutane (or 2-methylpropane).\nn-butane: CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3\nisobutane: (CH3)3CH\n\n2. Stereoisomers have the same molecular formula and connectivity of atoms but differ in the spatial arrangement of atoms. They have the same bonding sequence but different orientations in three-dimensional space. Stereoisomers can be further classified into two types: enantiomers and diastereomers.\n\na) Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They have the same physical properties but differ in the way they rotate plane-polarized light. One enantiomer will rotate light clockwise (dextrorotatory), while the other will rotate it counterclockwise (levorotatory).\n\nExample: Lactic acid has two enantiomers, L-lactic acid, and D-lactic acid.\n\nb) Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties, such as boiling points, melting points, and solubilities.\n\nDiastereomers can be further divided into two subcategories: geometric isomers (cis-trans isomers) and conformational isomers.\n\ni) Geometric isomers (cis-trans isomers) occur when there is restricted rotation around a bond, such as a double bond or a ring structure. They differ in the position of substituents relative to a reference plane.\n\nExample: Cis-2-butene and trans-2-butene are geometric isomers.\nCis-2-butene: H3C-CH=CH-CH3 (with both CH3 groups on the same side of the double bond)\nTrans-2-butene: H3C-CH=CH-CH3 (with both CH3 groups on opposite sides of the double bond)\n\nii) Conformational isomers are different spatial arrangements of a molecule that arise due to the rotation around single bonds. They can interconvert rapidly at room temperature and are usually not isolable.\n\nExample: Ethane has two conformational isomers: staggered and eclipsed conformations.\n\nIn summary, structural isomers have different connectivity of atoms, while stereoisomers have the same connectivity but different spatial arrangements. Stereoisomers can be enantiomers (mirror images) or diastereomers (non-mirror images), with diastereomers further classified into geometric isomers and conformational isomers."
