The balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane is as follows: \nCH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(l) + energy.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of combustion of methane, we first need to determine the amount of heat released during the combustion process. We can do this using the heat capacity of the calorimeter and the temperature change.\n\nq = heat capacity × ΔT\nq = 1.26 kJ/°C × 4.58 °C\nq = 5.7688 kJ\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of moles of methane burned. The molar mass of methane (CH4) is 12.01 g/mol (C) + 4 × 1.01 g/mol (H) = 16.05 g/mol.\n\nmoles of CH4 = mass / molar mass\nmoles of CH4 = 2.56 g / 16.05 g/mol\nmoles of CH4 = 0.1595 mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy of combustion per mole of methane:\n\nΔH_combustion = -q / moles of CH4\nΔH_combustion = -5.7688 kJ / 0.1595 mol\nΔH_combustion = -36.18 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy of combustion of methane is approximately -36.18 kJ/mol."
