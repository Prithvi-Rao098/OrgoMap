    "message_2": "To calculate the standard free energy change (ΔG°) for the redox reaction, we first need to determine the overall cell potential (E°) for the reaction. The cell potential can be found using the standard reduction potentials given:\n\nE°(cell) = E°(cathode) - E°(anode)\n\nIn this reaction, silver ions (Ag+) are reduced to silver metal (Ag), so the silver half-reaction is the cathode. Copper metal (Cu) is oxidized to copper ions (Cu2+), so the copper half-reaction is the anode.\n\nE°(cell) = E°(Ag+/Ag) - E°(Cu2+/Cu)\nE°(cell) = (+0.80 V) - (+0.34 V)\nE°(cell) = +0.46 V\n\nNow that we have the cell potential, we can calculate the standard free energy change (ΔG°) using the following equation:\n\nΔG° = -nFE°(cell)\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the reaction, F is Faraday's constant (96,485 C/mol), and E°(cell) is the cell potential.\n\nIn this reaction, 2 moles of electrons are transferred (from Cu to 2Ag+):\n\nΔG° = -(2 mol)(96,485 C/mol)(+0.46 V)\nΔG° = -88,766 J/mol\n\nSince the standard free energy change is typically expressed in kJ/mol, we can convert the units:\n\nΔG° = -88.77 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard free energy change (ΔG°) for the given redox reaction at 298 K is -88.77 kJ/mol."
