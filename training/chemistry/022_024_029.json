    "message_1": "A student needs to prepare a buffer solution with a pH of 4.5 using acetic acid (pKa = 4.76) and its conjugate base sodium acetate. The student has 100 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid and has access to sodium acetate. What mass of sodium acetate (in grams) should the student add to the solution to achieve the desired pH?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log ([A-]/[HA])\n\nwhere pH is the desired pH of the buffer solution, pKa is the acid dissociation constant of the weak acid, [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base (sodium acetate), and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid (acetic acid).\n\nWe are given the pH (4.5), pKa (4.76), and the concentration of acetic acid (0.1 M). We need to find the concentration of sodium acetate ([A-]).\n\n4.5 = 4.76 + log ([A-]/0.1)\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for [A-]:\n\nlog ([A-]/0.1) = 4.5 - 4.76\nlog ([A-]/0.1) = -0.26\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of [A-] to 0.1:\n\n[A-]/0.1 = 10^(-0.26)\n[A-] = 0.1 * 10^(-0.26)\n\nCalculating the concentration of sodium acetate:\n\n[A-] ≈ 0.1 * 0.55\n[A-] ≈ 0.055 M\n\nNow, we need to find the mass of sodium acetate needed to achieve this concentration in 100 mL of solution:\n\nmoles of sodium acetate = 0.055 moles/L * 0.100 L\nmoles of sodium acetate ≈ 0.0055 moles\n\nThe molar mass of sodium acetate (CH3COONa) is approximately 82.03 g/mol. Therefore, the mass of sodium acetate needed is:\n\nmass of sodium acetate = 0.0055 moles * 82.03 g/mol\nmass of sodium acetate ≈ 0.451 g\n\nThe student should add approximately 0.451 grams of sodium acetate to the solution to achieve the desired pH of 4.5."
