    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates the vapor pressure of a substance at different temperatures to its enthalpy of vaporization:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nWhere:\nP1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively\nΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization\nR is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\nT1 and T2 are the temperatures in Kelvin\n\nWe are given the boiling point (60°C) and the enthalpy of vaporization (40 kJ/mol). We need to find the vapor pressure at 30°C.\n\nFirst, let's convert the temperatures to Kelvin:\nT1 = 60°C + 273.15 = 333.15 K (boiling point)\nT2 = 30°C + 273.15 = 303.15 K (temperature we want to find the vapor pressure at)\n\nAt the boiling point, the vapor pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure. We will assume the atmospheric pressure is 1 atm, which is approximately 101.3 kPa.\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/101.3) = -(40,000 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K) * (1/303.15 - 1/333.15)\n\nSolving for P2:\n\nln(P2/101.3) = -40,000 / 8.314 * (-0.000099)\nln(P2/101.3) ≈ 0.397\n\nNow, exponentiate both sides to get rid of the natural logarithm:\n\nP2/101.3 = e^0.397\nP2 ≈ 101.3 * e^0.397\nP2 ≈ 101.3 * 1.487\nP2 ≈ 150.7 kPa\n\nTherefore, the vapor pressure of the liquid at 30°C is approximately 150.7 kPa."
