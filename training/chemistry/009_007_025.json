    "message_2": "Uranium-238 (U-238) primarily undergoes alpha decay. In this decay mode, the nucleus emits an alpha particle, which consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. As a result, the atomic number decreases by 2 and the mass number decreases by 4. \n\nAfter undergoing alpha decay, Uranium-238 (U-238) transforms into Thorium-234 (Th-234). The resulting element, Thorium, has an atomic number of 90 (2 less than Uranium's 92) and a mass number of 234 (4 less than Uranium's 238)."
