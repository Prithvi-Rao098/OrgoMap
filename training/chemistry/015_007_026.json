    "message_2": "To determine the electronic configuration and the energies of the excited states of a benzene molecule using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), you would need to perform a series of computational calculations. Here, I will provide a general overview of the process.\n\n1. First, you need to optimize the geometry of the benzene molecule using density functional theory (DFT). This step will provide you with the most stable structure of the molecule.\n\n2. Next, you need to perform a ground state DFT calculation to obtain the electronic configuration of the benzene molecule in its ground state. For benzene, the electronic configuration is as follows:\n\n1a_g^2 1b_u^2 2a_g^2 1b_2g^2 3a_g^2 1b_3u^2 2b_1u^2 1b_2u^2 3b_1u^2\n\n3. Now, you can perform a TDDFT calculation to determine the energies of the excited states of the benzene molecule. This calculation will provide you with a list of excited states and their corresponding energies, oscillator strengths, and transition moments.\n\n4. Analyze the results of the TDDFT calculation to identify the most relevant excited states and their energies. Keep in mind that the number of excited states you obtain will depend on the level of theory and basis set used in your calculations.\n\nIn summary, the electronic configuration and the energies of the excited states of a benzene molecule can be determined using TDDFT calculations. However, the specific values will depend on the computational method and basis set used in the calculations."
