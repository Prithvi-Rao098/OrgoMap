    "message_2": "To find the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid, we can use the formula for the ionization constant (Ka) of a weak acid:\n\nKa = [H+][A-]/[HA]\n\nIn this case, the Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.8 x 10^-5. We can set up an equation to solve for the concentration of hydrogen ions [H+]:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 = [H+][0.1 - H+]/[0.1]\n\nSince the concentration of hydrogen ions [H+] will be much smaller than the initial concentration of acetic acid (0.1 M), we can approximate the equation as:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 ≈ [H+](0.1)/[0.1]\n\nNow, we can solve for [H+]:\n\n[H+] ≈ 1.8 x 10^-5\n\nFinally, we can use the formula for pH:\n\npH = -log[H+]\n\npH = -log(1.8 x 10^-5)\n\npH ≈ 4.74\n\nSo, the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid is approximately 4.74."
