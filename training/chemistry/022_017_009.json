CO2(g) + H2(g) → CO(g) + H2O(g) ∆H2 = 41.2 kJ/mol\n3. CO(g) + 1/2O2(g) → CO2(g) ∆H3 = -283.0 kJ/mol\n\nCalculate the enthalpy change (∆H) for the reaction:\n\nCH4(g) + 1/2O2(g) → CO(g) + 2H2O(g)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the given reaction using Hess's Law, we need to manipulate the given equations so that they add up to the desired reaction. \n\nDesired reaction: CH4(g) + 1/2O2(g) → CO(g) + 2H2O(g)\n\nFirst, we'll divide equation 1 by 2:\n\n1/2: CH4(g) + 3/2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(g) ∆H1/2 = -445.5 kJ/mol\n\nNext, we'll reverse equation 2:\n\n-2: CO(g) + H2O(g) → CO2(g) + H2(g) ∆H(-2) = -41.2 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can add equation 1/2 and equation -2:\n\nCH4(g) + 3/2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(g) ∆H1/2 = -445.5 kJ/mol\nCO(g) + H2O(g) → CO2(g) + H2(g) ∆H(-2) = -41.2 kJ/mol\n---------------------------------------------\nCH4(g) + 1/2O2(g) → CO(g) + 2H2O(g) ∆H = ?\n\nNow, we can add the ∆H values:\n\n∆H = ∆H1/2 + ∆H(-2) = -445.5 kJ/mol + (-41.2 kJ/mol) = -486.7 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the enthalpy change for the desired reaction is ∆H = -486.7 kJ/mol."
