    "message_2": "When the pressure of a system at equilibrium is increased, the equilibrium position will shift in the direction that reduces the pressure. This occurs according to Le Chatelier's principle, which states that if a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in conditions, the system will adjust itself to counteract the change and re-establish equilibrium.\n\nAn example of a chemical reaction that demonstrates this principle is the synthesis of ammonia (NH3) from nitrogen (N2) and hydrogen (H2):\n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g)\n\nIn this reaction, there are 4 moles of gas on the reactant side (1 mole of N2 and 3 moles of H2) and 2 moles of gas on the product side (2 moles of NH3). If the pressure of the system is increased, the equilibrium will shift in the direction that reduces the pressure, which is the direction with fewer moles of gas. In this case, the equilibrium will shift to the right, towards the formation of ammonia.\n\nBy shifting the equilibrium position to the right, the system counteracts the increase in pressure by reducing the number of gas particles in the system. This is in accordance with Le Chatelier's principle, as the system adjusts itself to minimize the effect of the increased pressure and re-establish equilibrium."
