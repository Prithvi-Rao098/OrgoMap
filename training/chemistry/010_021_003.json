    "message_2": "In a galvanic couple, the corrosion potential (E_corr) can be determined using the standard reduction potentials (E°) of the two half-reactions involved. The overall cell potential (E_cell) can be calculated using the Nernst equation:\n\nE_cell = E°_cathode - E°_anode\n\nIn this case, the copper electrode acts as the cathode (reduction occurs), and the zinc electrode acts as the anode (oxidation occurs). The standard reduction potentials for the two half-reactions are given as:\n\nE°_Cu²⁺/Cu = +0.34 V\nE°_Zn²⁺/Zn = -0.76 V\n\nNow, we can calculate the overall cell potential:\n\nE_cell = E°_Cu²⁺/Cu - E°_Zn²⁺/Zn\nE_cell = (+0.34 V) - (-0.76 V)\nE_cell = +0.34 V + 0.76 V\nE_cell = +1.10 V\n\nThe corrosion potential of the zinc electrode in the galvanic couple with the copper electrode is +1.10 V."
