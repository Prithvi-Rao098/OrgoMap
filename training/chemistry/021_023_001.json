    "message_2": "To determine whether two molecules have the same molecular formula but different structures (isomers) using their Lewis structures, follow these steps:\n\n1. Verify the molecular formula: Count the number of atoms of each element in both molecules and ensure they have the same molecular formula.\n\n2. Draw the Lewis structures: Draw the Lewis structures for both molecules, making sure to follow the octet rule and minimize formal charges. This will give you a visual representation of the electron distribution and bonding in each molecule.\n\n3. Identify the type of isomers: There are different types of isomers, such as structural (constitutional) isomers, geometric (cis-trans) isomers, and stereoisomers (enantiomers and diastereomers). Determine which type of isomerism is present between the two molecules.\n\n4. Compare the connectivity of atoms: For structural isomers, the connectivity of atoms will be different. Check if the atoms are connected differently in the two Lewis structures.\n\n5. Compare the arrangement of atoms in space: For geometric isomers, the arrangement of atoms or groups around a double bond or a ring will be different. For stereoisomers, the arrangement of atoms in space will be different, but the connectivity will be the same. Look for differences in the spatial arrangement of atoms or groups in the two Lewis structures.\n\n6. Assess the overall molecular geometry: Compare the molecular geometry of the two molecules. If they have different geometries, they are likely isomers.\n\nIf the two molecules have the same molecular formula, different connectivity or arrangement of atoms, and different molecular geometries, they are likely isomers."
