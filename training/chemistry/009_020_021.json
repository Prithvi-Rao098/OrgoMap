    "message_2": "Isotopic labeling is a technique used to study chemical reaction mechanisms by replacing specific atoms in a molecule with their isotopes. These isotopes have the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons, resulting in a different atomic mass. The most commonly used isotopes in isotopic labeling are deuterium (²H), carbon-13 (¹³C), and nitrogen-15 (¹⁵N). The labeled isotopes can be detected using various analytical techniques such as mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and infrared (IR) spectroscopy.\n\nHere's how isotopic labeling can be used to study chemical reaction mechanisms:\n\n1. Determining the reaction pathway: By introducing isotopically labeled reactants into a reaction, chemists can track the movement of atoms throughout the reaction and determine the sequence of events that occur during the reaction. This helps in understanding the reaction pathway and the intermediates formed during the reaction.\n\n2. Identifying the rate-determining step: Isotopic labeling can be used to study the kinetics of a reaction by measuring the rate of the reaction with the labeled reactant and comparing it to the rate with the unlabeled reactant. If the rate of the reaction changes significantly, it indicates that the labeled atom is involved in the rate-determining step of the reaction.\n\n3. Investigating reaction intermediates: Some reaction intermediates are short-lived and difficult to detect directly. By using isotopic labeling, chemists can indirectly observe these intermediates by tracking the labeled atoms in the products formed during the reaction.\n\n4. Studying enzyme mechanisms: Isotopic labeling is widely used in the study of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. By incorporating isotopes into the substrate or the enzyme, researchers can gain insights into the binding interactions, catalytic mechanisms, and the role of specific amino acid residues in the enzyme's active site.\n\n5. Investigating the stereochemistry of reactions: Isotopic labeling can be used to study the stereochemical outcome of a reaction. By introducing chiral isotopically labeled reactants, chemists can determine the stereochemistry of the products formed during the reaction, providing insights into the stereochemical control of the reaction mechanism.\n\nIn summary, isotopic labeling is a powerful tool for studying chemical reaction mechanisms, as it allows chemists to track the movement of atoms throughout the reaction, determine reaction pathways, identify rate-determining steps, investigate reaction intermediates, and study the stereochemistry of reactions."
