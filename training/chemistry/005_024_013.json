    "message_2": "Carbohydrates interact with proteins through various non-covalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, and electrostatic interactions. These interactions play a crucial role in various biological processes, including cell signaling, immune response, and protein folding. The chemical properties that govern these interactions are mainly the structure and functional groups of carbohydrates and proteins, as well as the surrounding environment.\n\n1. Structure: The structure of carbohydrates, such as monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides, can influence their interactions with proteins. For example, the spatial arrangement of hydroxyl groups on carbohydrates can determine the specificity of their binding to proteins. Similarly, the three-dimensional structure of proteins, including their secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, can affect their interactions with carbohydrates.\n\n2. Functional groups: The functional groups present in carbohydrates and proteins play a significant role in their interactions. For instance, hydroxyl groups in carbohydrates can form hydrogen bonds with amino acid side chains in proteins, such as serine, threonine, and tyrosine. Additionally, charged functional groups, like carboxylates and amines, can participate in electrostatic interactions.\n\n3. Surrounding environment: The surrounding environment, such as pH, temperature, and ionic strength, can also influence the interactions between carbohydrates and proteins. For example, changes in pH can alter the protonation state of functional groups, affecting their ability to form hydrogen bonds or electrostatic interactions. Temperature can affect the stability of these interactions, while ionic strength can influence the strength of electrostatic interactions.\n\nIn summary, carbohydrates interact with proteins through various non-covalent interactions, and these interactions are governed by the structure and functional groups of carbohydrates and proteins, as well as the surrounding environment. Understanding these interactions is essential for studying biological processes and developing therapeutic strategies targeting protein-carbohydrate interactions."
