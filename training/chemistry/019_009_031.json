    "message_1": "What is the standard free energy change (in kJ/mol) for the following redox reaction at 25°C?\n\nFe2+(aq) + Sn4+(aq) → Fe3+(aq) + Sn2+(aq)\n\nGiven the standard reduction potentials at 25°C:\nFe3+(aq) + e- → Fe2+(aq)    E° = +0.771 V\nSn4+(aq) + 2e- → Sn2+(aq)   E° = +0.136 V",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard free energy change (ΔG°) for the redox reaction, we first need to determine the overall cell potential (E°) for the reaction. We can do this by subtracting the reduction potential of the half-reaction being reversed (oxidation) from the reduction potential of the half-reaction that remains as reduction.\n\nIn this case, the Fe2+ is being oxidized to Fe3+, so we need to reverse the first half-reaction:\n\nFe2+(aq) → Fe3+(aq) + e-    E° = -0.771 V\n\nThe Sn4+ is being reduced to Sn2+, so the second half-reaction remains the same:\n\nSn4+(aq) + 2e- → Sn2+(aq)   E° = +0.136 V\n\nNow, we can calculate the overall cell potential (E°):\n\nE° = E°(reduction) - E°(oxidation) = 0.136 V - (-0.771 V) = 0.907 V\n\nNext, we can use the relationship between the standard free energy change (ΔG°) and the cell potential (E°):\n\nΔG° = -nFE°\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of electrons transferred (in this case, 1 mole), F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol), and E° is the cell potential.\n\nΔG° = -(1 mol)(96,485 C/mol)(0.907 V) = -87,467.395 J/mol\n\nSince we want the answer in kJ/mol, we can convert the units:\n\nΔG° = -87,467.395 J/mol * (1 kJ/1000 J) = -87.47 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard free energy change (ΔG°) for the redox reaction at 25°C is approximately -87.47 kJ/mol."
