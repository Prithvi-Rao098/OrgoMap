We can manipulate the given reactions to match the target reaction and then add their enthalpies.\n\nFirst, let's look at the target reaction:\nC2H6(g) + 7/2 O2(g) --> 2CO2(g) + 3H2O(l)\n\nNow, let's manipulate the given reactions:\n\n1) C2H6(g) + 3 1/2 O2(g) --> 2CO2(g) + 3H2O(l) ΔH°f = -1560 kJ/mol\nThis reaction is already part of the target reaction, so we don't need to change it.\n\n2) 2H2(g) + O2(g) --> 2H2O(l) ΔH°f = -484 kJ/mol\nThis reaction is not needed for the target reaction, so we can ignore it.\n\nNow, let's add the manipulated reactions:\nC2H6(g) + 3 1/2 O2(g) --> 2CO2(g) + 3H2O(l) ΔH°f = -1560 kJ/mol\n\nThe manipulated reactions match the target reaction, so we can add their enthalpies:\nΔH° = -1560 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy change for the combustion reaction is -1560 kJ/mol."
