    "message_2": "The hybridization of the central atom (sulfur) in the molecule SF6 (sulfur hexafluoride) is sp3d2. This is because sulfur has 6 valence electrons, and it forms 6 sigma bonds with the 6 fluorine atoms. To accommodate these 6 sigma bonds, sulfur needs to hybridize its one 3s, three 3p, and two 3d orbitals, resulting in a total of six sp3d2 hybrid orbitals."
