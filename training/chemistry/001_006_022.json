    "message_2": "The major product of the reaction between 2-methyl-2-butene (CH3C(CH3)=C(CH3)2) and HBr in an aqueous solution is 2-bromo-2-methylbutane (CH3C(CH3)(Br)C(CH3)3). This reaction follows Markovnikov's rule, where the hydrogen atom (H) from HBr will attach to the carbon with the most hydrogen atoms, and the bromine atom (Br) will attach to the carbon with the least hydrogen atoms."
