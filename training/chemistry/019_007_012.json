    "message_1": "What is the reaction quotient (Qc) of the chemical reaction 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O at a temperature of 25°C given that the initial concentration of H2 is 0.5M, initial concentration of O2 is 0.2M, and initial concentration of H2O is 0M?",
    "message_2": "The reaction quotient (Qc) is calculated using the formula:\n\nQc = [products] / [reactants]\n\nFor the given reaction, 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O, the formula for Qc will be:\n\nQc = ([H2O]^2) / ([H2]^2 * [O2])\n\nGiven the initial concentrations:\n[H2] = 0.5 M\n[O2] = 0.2 M\n[H2O] = 0 M\n\nSince the reaction has not yet occurred, the initial concentration of the product (H2O) is 0. Therefore, the reaction quotient Qc will be:\n\nQc = (0^2) / (0.5^2 * 0.2) = 0\n\nSo, the reaction quotient (Qc) at the initial state is 0."
