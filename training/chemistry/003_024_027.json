    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the integrated rate law for a first-order reaction and the equilibrium constant expression.\n\nFirst, let's find the integrated rate law for a first-order reaction:\n\n[A]t = [A]0 * e^(-kt)\n\nwhere [A]t is the concentration of A at time t, [A]0 is the initial concentration of A, k is the rate constant, and t is the time.\n\nSince the system reaches equilibrium after 2 minutes, we can plug in the values:\n\n[A]t = 0.1 * e^(-0.05 * 2 * 60)\n\n[A]t = 0.1 * e^(-6)\n\n[A]t ≈ 0.1 * 0.002478752 = 0.0002478752 M\n\nNow, let's find the concentration of B at equilibrium. Since the reaction is A ⇌ B, the change in the concentration of A is equal to the change in the concentration of B. Therefore, the concentration of B at equilibrium can be found by subtracting the equilibrium concentration of A from the initial concentration of A:\n\n[B]eq = [A]0 - [A]t\n\n[B]eq = 0.1 - 0.0002478752\n\n[B]eq ≈ 0.0997521248 M\n\nSo, the concentration of B at equilibrium is approximately 0.0998 M."
