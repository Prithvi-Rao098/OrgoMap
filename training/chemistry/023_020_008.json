    "message_2": "The preparation of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid from benzoic acid and chlorine gas involves a stepwise electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reaction mechanism. The chlorination reaction occurs in two steps, with the first chlorination at the ortho or para position and the second chlorination at the other ortho position. Here's the stepwise mechanism:\n\n1. Activation of chlorine: Chlorine gas (Cl2) reacts with a Lewis acid catalyst, such as aluminum chloride (AlCl3), to form a highly reactive electrophile, the chloronium ion (Cl+). This step is essential for the electrophilic aromatic substitution to occur.\n   Cl2 + AlCl3 → Cl+ + AlCl4-\n\n2. First chlorination: The electrophile (Cl+) attacks the benzoic acid at the ortho or para position relative to the carboxyl group, forming a sigma complex. This is because the carboxyl group is a deactivating and meta-directing group, but the ortho and para positions are sterically hindered due to the presence of the carboxyl group.\n   C6H5COOH + Cl+ → C6H4(Cl)COOH (ortho or para)\n\n3. Aromaticity restoration: A proton is removed from the sigma complex by the AlCl4- anion, restoring the aromaticity of the ring and forming the first chlorinated product, either ortho-chlorobenzoic acid or para-chlorobenzoic acid.\n   C6H4(Cl)COOH + AlCl4- → C6H4(Cl)COO- + HAlCl4\n\n4. Second chlorination: The first chlorinated product reacts with another equivalent of Cl+ to form a new sigma complex, with the second chlorination occurring at the other ortho position relative to the carboxyl group.\n   C6H4(Cl)COOH + Cl+ → C6H3(Cl2)COOH (2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid)\n\n5. Aromaticity restoration: A proton is removed from the sigma complex by the AlCl4- anion, restoring the aromaticity of the ring and forming the final product, 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid.\n   C6H3(Cl2)COOH + AlCl4- → C6H3(Cl2)COO- + HAlCl4\n\nIn summary, the chlorination reactions occur in steps 2 and 4, with the first chlorination at the ortho or para position and the second chlorination at the other ortho position."
