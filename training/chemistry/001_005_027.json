    "message_1": "What is the boiling point of cyclohexane and n-hexane? How do their boiling points compare?",
    "message_2": "The boiling point of cyclohexane is approximately 80.7째C (177.3째F), while the boiling point of n-hexane is around 68.7째C (155.7째F). Comparing their boiling points, cyclohexane has a higher boiling point than n-hexane. This difference can be attributed to the fact that cyclohexane has a more compact, cyclic structure, which leads to stronger London dispersion forces compared to the linear structure of n-hexane. As a result, more energy is required to overcome these forces and cause cyclohexane to boil."
