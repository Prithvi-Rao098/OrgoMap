    "message_2": "When a piece of iron is placed in a solution containing copper ions, a single replacement reaction occurs. In this reaction, iron displaces copper ions, forming iron ions and solid copper. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nFe (s) + Cu²⁺ (aq) → Fe²⁺ (aq) + Cu (s)"
