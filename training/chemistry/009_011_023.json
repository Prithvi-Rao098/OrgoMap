    "message_2": "To determine the half-life of a radioactive isotope using a graph of its decay rate, you need to plot the decay curve and find the time it takes for the isotope's activity to decrease to half of its initial value. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Collect data: Obtain the decay rate data for the radioactive isotope, in this case, carbon-14. The data should include the time and the corresponding decay rate or activity.\n\n2. Plot the graph: Plot the decay rate (y-axis) against time (x-axis) using the data collected. The graph should show an exponential decay curve.\n\n3. Determine the half-life: Locate the point on the y-axis that corresponds to half of the initial activity of the isotope. From this point, draw a horizontal line until it intersects the decay curve. Then, draw a vertical line from the intersection point down to the x-axis. The value on the x-axis where the vertical line intersects represents the half-life of the radioactive isotope.\n\nNow, let's use carbon-14 as an example to calculate the age of a fossil:\n\nCarbon-14 has a known half-life of 5,730 years. When a living organism dies, it stops taking in carbon-14, and the carbon-14 in its body begins to decay into nitrogen-14 at a known rate. By measuring the remaining carbon-14 in the fossil and comparing it to the initial amount of carbon-14, we can determine how many half-lives have passed since the organism's death.\n\nSuppose we have a fossil sample with 25% of its original carbon-14 remaining. To find out how many half-lives have passed, we can use the formula:\n\nN = N0 * (1/2)^n\n\nWhere N is the remaining amount of carbon-14, N0 is the initial amount of carbon-14, and n is the number of half-lives.\n\nIn this case, N/N0 = 0.25, which means:\n\n0.25 = (1/2)^n\n\nTo solve for n, we can take the logarithm of both sides:\n\nlog(0.25) = n * log(0.5)\n\nn = log(0.25) / log(0.5)\nn ≈ 2\n\nSo, approximately 2 half-lives have passed since the organism's death. To calculate the age of the fossil, we multiply the number of half-lives by the half-life of carbon-14:\n\nAge = n * half-life\nAge = 2 * 5,730 years\nAge ≈ 11,460 years\n\nThus, the age of the fossil is approximately 11,460 years."
