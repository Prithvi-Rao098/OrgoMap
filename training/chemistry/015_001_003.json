    "message_2": "To calculate the molecular orbital diagram and electronic configuration of the O2 molecule, we first need to determine the total number of valence electrons. Oxygen has 6 valence electrons, and since there are two oxygen atoms in the O2 molecule, the total number of valence electrons is 12.\n\nNow, we can construct the molecular orbital diagram for O2. The molecular orbitals are formed by the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) from the two oxygen atoms. The order of molecular orbitals for O2 is:\n\n1. σ2s\n2. σ*2s\n3. σ2p\n4. π2p (degenerate orbitals)\n5. π*2p (degenerate orbitals)\n6. σ*2p\n\nNow, we can fill the molecular orbitals with the 12 valence electrons, following the Aufbau principle, Hund's rule, and the Pauli exclusion principle:\n\n1. σ2s: 2 electrons\n2. σ*2s: 2 electrons\n3. σ2p: 2 electrons\n4. π2p: 4 electrons (2 electrons in each degenerate orbital)\n5. π*2p: 2 electrons (1 electron in each degenerate orbital)\n6. σ*2p: 0 electrons\n\nSo, the electronic configuration of the O2 molecule is:\n\nσ2s² σ*2s² σ2p² π2p⁴ π*2p²\n\nTo determine the bond order, we can use the formula:\n\nBond order = (number of electrons in bonding orbitals - number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\n\nBond order = (8 - 4) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2\n\nThe bond order of O2 is 2, which indicates a double bond between the two oxygen atoms.\n\nTo determine the magnetic nature of the O2 molecule, we need to check if there are any unpaired electrons. In the molecular orbital diagram, we can see that there are two unpaired electrons in the π*2p orbitals. Since there are unpaired electrons, the O2 molecule is paramagnetic."
