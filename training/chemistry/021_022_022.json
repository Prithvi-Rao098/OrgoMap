    "message_2": "The molecule HNO3, also known as nitric acid, is predicted to be acidic. There are several factors that contribute to this prediction:\n\n1. Presence of a hydrogen atom: HNO3 has a hydrogen atom bonded to an oxygen atom, which can be easily ionized to release a proton (H+). This is a characteristic feature of acidic compounds.\n\n2. Electronegativity of the central atom: Nitrogen, the central atom in HNO3, is highly electronegative. This causes the oxygen atoms to pull electron density away from the hydrogen atom, making it easier for the hydrogen to be released as a proton (H+).\n\n3. Resonance stabilization: The nitrate ion (NO3-) that forms after the release of a proton from HNO3 is resonance stabilized, meaning that the negative charge is delocalized over the entire ion. This stabilization makes it energetically favorable for HNO3 to lose a proton and become the nitrate ion.\n\n4. Comparison with water: HNO3 is a strong acid, which means that it ionizes completely in water. This is because the oxygen-hydrogen bond in HNO3 is weaker than the oxygen-hydrogen bond in water, making it easier for HNO3 to donate a proton to water and form hydronium ions (H3O+).\n\nIn summary, the predicted acidity of HNO3 is due to the presence of an ionizable hydrogen atom, the high electronegativity of the central atom, resonance stabilization of the resulting ion, and its ability to donate a proton to water."
