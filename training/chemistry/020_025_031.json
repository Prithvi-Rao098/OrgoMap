    "message_2": "The reaction between iodine (I2) and iodide ion (I-) in a solution of potassium iodide (KI) can be represented as follows:\n\nI2 + 2I- â‡Œ 2KI\n\nTo determine the equilibrium constant (Kc) for this reaction, we need to know the equilibrium concentrations of the reactants and products. However, you have not provided any specific concentration values for the reactants and products in this reaction.\n\nIf you can provide the equilibrium concentrations of I2, I-, and KI, I can help you calculate the equilibrium constant (Kc) for this reaction."
