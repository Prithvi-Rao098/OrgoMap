    "message_2": "2,3-dichlorobutane has two chiral centers, which are carbons 2 and 3. To determine the number of stereoisomers, we can use the formula 2^n, where n is the number of chiral centers. In this case, n = 2, so there are 2^2 = 4 possible stereoisomers.\n\nHere are the structures of the four stereoisomers:\n\n1. (2R,3R)-2,3-dichlorobutane:\n\n      Cl      Cl\n       |       |\nH3C - C - C - C - CH3\n       |       |\n       H       H\n\n2. (2S,3S)-2,3-dichlorobutane:\n\n      Cl      Cl\n       |       |\nH3C - C - C - C - CH3\n       |       |\n       H       H\n\n3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dichlorobutane:\n\n      Cl      H\n       |       |\nH3C - C - C - C - CH3\n       |       |\n       H       Cl\n\n4. (2S,3R)-2,3-dichlorobutane:\n\n      Cl      H\n       |       |\nH3C - C - C - C - CH3\n       |       |\n       H       Cl\n\nThese four stereoisomers include two pairs of enantiomers: (2R,3R) and (2S,3S), and (2R,3S) and (2S,3R)."
