    "message_2": "The concentration of a catalyst affects the reaction rate of the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide by increasing the number of available active sites for the reaction to occur. Catalysts work by lowering the activation energy of a reaction, which allows the reaction to proceed at a faster rate. In the case of hydrogen peroxide decomposition, the catalyst can be a substance like manganese dioxide (MnO2), potassium iodide (KI), or catalase enzyme.\n\nWhen the concentration of the catalyst is increased, there are more active sites available for the hydrogen peroxide molecules to interact with. This means that more hydrogen peroxide molecules can react simultaneously, leading to an increase in the reaction rate. However, it is important to note that there is a limit to how much the reaction rate can be increased by adding more catalyst. Once all the hydrogen peroxide molecules are reacting with the catalyst, adding more catalyst will not further increase the reaction rate.\n\nIn summary, increasing the concentration of the catalyst in the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide will increase the reaction rate up to a certain point. Beyond that point, adding more catalyst will not have a significant effect on the reaction rate."
