    "message_1": "The problem can be stated as follows: A mixture of three solvents, A, B, and C, is provided. The composition of the mixture is unknown but it is suspected that solvent C is present only in small quantities. Using gas chromatography, how can you determine the relative amounts of each solvent in the mixture and confirm the presence of solvent C in the mixture?",
    "message_2": "To determine the relative amounts of each solvent (A, B, and C) in the mixture and confirm the presence of solvent C using gas chromatography, follow these steps:\n\n1. Obtain pure samples of solvents A, B, and C for calibration purposes.\n\n2. Run gas chromatography (GC) analysis on each pure solvent sample separately to determine their retention times and response factors. Retention time is the time it takes for a compound to pass through the GC column and reach the detector. Response factor is the ratio of the detector's response to the amount of the compound injected.\n\n3. Prepare a calibration curve for each solvent by injecting known concentrations of each pure solvent into the GC and plotting the peak area or peak height against the concentration. This will help in determining the concentration of each solvent in the mixture based on their peak areas or heights.\n\n4. Run the GC analysis on the unknown mixture. The chromatogram obtained will show peaks corresponding to each solvent present in the mixture. Identify the peaks by comparing their retention times with those of the pure solvents.\n\n5. Measure the peak area or height of each identified peak in the chromatogram of the mixture.\n\n6. Use the calibration curves obtained in step 3 to determine the concentration of each solvent in the mixture based on their peak areas or heights.\n\n7. Calculate the relative amounts of each solvent in the mixture by dividing the concentration of each solvent by the total concentration of all solvents.\n\n8. Confirm the presence of solvent C in the mixture by observing its peak in the chromatogram and comparing its retention time with that of the pure solvent C. If the peak is present and the retention time matches, it confirms the presence of solvent C in the mixture.\n\nBy following these steps, you can determine the relative amounts of solvents A, B, and C in the mixture and confirm the presence of solvent C using gas chromatography."
