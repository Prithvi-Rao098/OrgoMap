    "message_2": "To find the average kinetic energy of a gas molecule at a given temperature, we can use the following equation:\n\nAverage kinetic energy (KE) = (3/2) * k * T\n\nwhere k is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10^(-23) J/K) and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin:\n\nT(K) = T(°C) + 273.15\nT(K) = 25 °C + 273.15\nT(K) = 298.15 K\n\nNow, we can calculate the average kinetic energy:\n\nKE = (3/2) * (1.38 × 10^(-23) J/K) * (298.15 K)\nKE ≈ 6.21 × 10^(-21) J\n\nSo, the average kinetic energy of a gas molecule at 25 °C and 1 atm pressure is approximately 6.21 × 10^(-21) Joules."
