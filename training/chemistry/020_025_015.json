    "message_2": "The reaction between iodine (I2) and thiosulfate ions (S2O3^2-) in the presence of hydrochloric acid (HCl) can be represented as follows:\n\n2 S2O3^2- (aq) + I2 (aq) â†’ S4O6^2- (aq) + 2 I^- (aq)\n\nTo determine the equilibrium constant (Kc) for this reaction, we need to know the equilibrium concentrations of all species involved. Unfortunately, without the specific concentrations or experimental data, we cannot directly calculate the equilibrium constant.\n\nHowever, if you have the initial concentrations and any changes in concentration during the reaction, you can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations and subsequently calculate the equilibrium constant.\n\nKeep in mind that the equilibrium constant is temperature-dependent, so the temperature at which the reaction occurs should also be considered when calculating Kc."
