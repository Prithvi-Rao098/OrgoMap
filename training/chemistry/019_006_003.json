    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (K) for the given reaction, we first need to determine the changes in the concentrations of the reactants and products at equilibrium.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation is:\n\n2NO(g) + O2(g) ⇌ 2NO2(g)\n\nAt equilibrium, the concentration of NO2 is 0.018 M. Since the initial concentration of NO2 was 0 M, the change in concentration is +0.018 M. According to the stoichiometry of the reaction, for every 2 moles of NO2 formed, 2 moles of NO and 1 mole of O2 are consumed. Therefore, the changes in the concentrations of NO and O2 are as follows:\n\nΔ[NO] = -0.018 M (since 2 moles of NO are consumed for every 2 moles of NO2 formed)\nΔ[O2] = -0.009 M (since 1 mole of O2 is consumed for every 2 moles of NO2 formed)\n\nNow, we can find the equilibrium concentrations of NO and O2:\n\n[NO]_eq = [NO]_initial + Δ[NO] = 0.03 M - 0.018 M = 0.012 M\n[O2]_eq = [O2]_initial + Δ[O2] = 0.02 M - 0.009 M = 0.011 M\n\nNow we can use the equilibrium concentrations to find the equilibrium constant (K) using the expression for K:\n\nK = [NO2]^2 / ([NO]^2 * [O2])\n\nPlugging in the equilibrium concentrations:\n\nK = (0.018)^2 / ((0.012)^2 * (0.011))\n\nK ≈ 3.24\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (K) for the given reaction at 298 K is approximately 3.24."
