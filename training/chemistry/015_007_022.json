    "message_2": "To calculate the wavelength of the light absorbed when an electron in a hydrogen atom transitions from the n=2 to n=4 energy level, we can use the Rydberg formula:\n\n1/λ = R_H * (1/n1^2 - 1/n2^2)\n\nwhere λ is the wavelength, R_H is the Rydberg constant for hydrogen (approximately 1.097 x 10^7 m^-1), n1 is the initial energy level (n=2), and n2 is the final energy level (n=4).\n\n1/λ = (1.097 x 10^7 m^-1) * (1/2^2 - 1/4^2)\n1/λ = (1.097 x 10^7 m^-1) * (1/4 - 1/16)\n1/λ = (1.097 x 10^7 m^-1) * (3/16)\n\nNow, we can find λ:\n\nλ = 1 / [(1.097 x 10^7 m^-1) * (3/16)]\nλ ≈ 6.56 x 10^-7 m\n\nThe wavelength of the light absorbed is approximately 656 nm.\n\nTo calculate the energy difference between these levels, we can use the formula:\n\nΔE = h * c / λ\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy difference, h is the Planck's constant (approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 Js), c is the speed of light (approximately 3.00 x 10^8 m/s), and λ is the wavelength we calculated above.\n\nΔE = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (3.00 x 10^8 m/s) / (6.56 x 10^-7 m)\nΔE ≈ 3.03 x 10^-19 J\n\nThe energy difference between the n=2 and n=4 energy levels is approximately 3.03 x 10^-19 J.\n\nNow, let's determine whether the resulting photon is in the visible or ultraviolet range. The visible light range is approximately between 400 nm and 700 nm. Since the calculated wavelength is 656 nm, it falls within the visible light range. Therefore, the resulting photon is in the visible range."
