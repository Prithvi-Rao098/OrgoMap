    "message_2": "There seems to be a misunderstanding in the question. Sodium chloride (NaCl) is a compound composed of sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl) atoms, not oxygen (O). Therefore, it is not possible to determine the electronegativity difference between chlorine and oxygen in NaCl.\n\nHowever, I can provide you with the electronegativity values of chlorine and oxygen. Chlorine (Cl) has an electronegativity value of 3.16, while oxygen (O) has an electronegativity value of 3.44. The difference between their electronegativities is 3.44 - 3.16 = 0.28."
