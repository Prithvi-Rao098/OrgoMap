    "message_2": "The photochemical activity of chiral molecules can be affected by the orientation of their optical isomers (enantiomers) relative to the light source. This is because the interaction between chiral molecules and light depends on the polarization of the light and the molecular structure of the chiral molecule.\n\nChiral molecules can absorb circularly polarized light (CPL), which is a type of light with a specific handedness (left or right). The handedness of CPL corresponds to the handedness of the chiral molecule's enantiomer. When a chiral molecule absorbs CPL, it can undergo photochemical reactions, such as isomerization or dissociation.\n\nThe orientation of the optical isomers relative to the light source can affect the efficiency of the photochemical reaction. If the orientation of the chiral molecule is such that it can effectively absorb the CPL, the photochemical activity will be higher. Conversely, if the orientation of the chiral molecule is not optimal for absorbing CPL, the photochemical activity will be lower.\n\nIn summary, the photochemical activity of chiral molecules can vary with changes in the orientation of their optical isomers relative to the light source. The efficiency of the photochemical reaction depends on the ability of the chiral molecule to absorb circularly polarized light, which in turn depends on the orientation of the molecule and the handedness of the light."
