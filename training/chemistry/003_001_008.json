    "message_2": "The standard enthalpy change for the combustion of methane gas (CH4) at 298 K and 1 atm pressure can be determined using the balanced chemical equation for the combustion reaction and the standard enthalpies of formation for the reactants and products.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane is:\n\nCH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l)\n\nThe standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) at 298 K for the substances involved in the reaction are:\n\nΔHf° [CH4(g)] = -74.8 kJ/mol\nΔHf° [O2(g)] = 0 kJ/mol (since it is in its elemental form)\nΔHf° [CO2(g)] = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔHf° [H2O(l)] = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nUsing the formula for calculating the standard enthalpy change of the reaction (ΔHr°):\n\nΔHr° = Σ [ΔHf° (products)] - Σ [ΔHf° (reactants)]\n\nΔHr° = [1 × (-393.5) + 2 × (-285.8)] - [1 × (-74.8) + 2 × 0]\n\nΔHr° = (-393.5 - 571.6) - (-74.8)\n\nΔHr° = -965.1 + 74.8\n\nΔHr° = -890.3 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of methane gas (CH4) at 298 K and 1 atm pressure is -890.3 kJ/mol."
