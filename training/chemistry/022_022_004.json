    "message_2": "When the concentration of one of the reactants in a chemical reaction is increased, the equilibrium of the reaction is disturbed. According to Le Chatelier's principle, when a change is applied to a system at equilibrium, the system will adjust itself to counteract the change and re-establish equilibrium.\n\nIn this case, increasing the concentration of one of the reactants will cause the system to shift in the direction that consumes the excess reactant, which is towards the products. This shift will result in an increase in the concentration of the products and a decrease in the concentration of the reactants until a new equilibrium is established.\n\nIn summary, when the concentration of a reactant is increased, the system will shift towards the products to re-establish equilibrium according to Le Chatelier's principle."
