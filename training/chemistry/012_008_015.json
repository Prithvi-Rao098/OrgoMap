    "message_2": "Ceramics are a class of materials characterized by their inorganic, non-metallic nature, and they typically exhibit strong ionic or covalent bonding. At high temperatures, the properties of ceramics change in several ways, making them suitable for use in high-temperature applications such as gas turbine engines and furnace linings. Some of these changes include:\n\n1. High-temperature strength: Ceramics generally have a high melting point and maintain their strength at elevated temperatures. This is due to the strong ionic or covalent bonds that hold the atoms together, which are less likely to break or weaken as the temperature increases. This makes ceramics ideal for applications where they will be subjected to high temperatures and mechanical stress.\n\n2. Thermal stability: Ceramics have low coefficients of thermal expansion, meaning they do not expand or contract significantly when heated or cooled. This property allows them to maintain their shape and dimensions under extreme temperature changes, making them suitable for use in environments with fluctuating temperatures.\n\n3. Thermal conductivity: Many ceramics have low thermal conductivity, which means they do not transfer heat easily. This property makes them excellent insulators, allowing them to protect sensitive components from high temperatures and maintain temperature gradients in systems like furnaces and engines.\n\n4. Chemical resistance: Ceramics are generally chemically inert and resistant to corrosion, even at high temperatures. This makes them suitable for use in harsh environments where they may be exposed to corrosive gases or chemicals.\n\n5. Oxidation resistance: Ceramics are typically resistant to oxidation at high temperatures, which means they do not react readily with oxygen in the air. This property helps to prevent the formation of oxide layers that can reduce the performance and lifespan of components in high-temperature applications.\n\n6. Wear resistance: Ceramics are often harder and more wear-resistant than metals, making them suitable for use in applications where components are subjected to friction and wear, such as bearings and cutting tools.\n\nIn summary, the properties of ceramics that change at high temperatures, such as their high-temperature strength, thermal stability, thermal conductivity, chemical resistance, oxidation resistance, and wear resistance, make them suitable for use in high-temperature applications like gas turbine engines and furnace linings. These properties allow ceramics to maintain their performance and integrity under extreme conditions, providing reliable and durable solutions for various industries."
