    "message_2": "The synthesis of phenylalanine from benzyl chloride and ammonia can be achieved through a three-step process involving the formation of an intermediate compound, benzylamine. Here is the step-by-step mechanism:\n\nStep 1: Formation of Benzylamine\n1. Benzyl chloride (C6H5CH2Cl) reacts with ammonia (NH3) in a nucleophilic substitution reaction.\n2. The nitrogen atom in ammonia acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon atom in benzyl chloride, which is connected to the chlorine atom.\n3. The chlorine atom leaves as a chloride ion (Cl-), and the nitrogen atom forms a bond with the carbon atom, resulting in the formation of benzylamine (C6H5CH2NH2) and a chloride ion (Cl-).\n\nStep 2: Formation of Phenylacetonitrile\n1. Benzylamine (C6H5CH2NH2) reacts with cyanogen bromide (BrCN) in a nucleophilic substitution reaction.\n2. The nitrogen atom in benzylamine acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon atom in cyanogen bromide, which is connected to the bromine atom.\n3. The bromine atom leaves as a bromide ion (Br-), and the nitrogen atom forms a bond with the carbon atom, resulting in the formation of phenylacetonitrile (C6H5CH2CN) and a bromide ion (Br-).\n\nStep 3: Hydrolysis of Phenylacetonitrile to Phenylalanine\n1. Phenylacetonitrile (C6H5CH2CN) undergoes hydrolysis in the presence of a strong acid (e.g., HCl) and water (H2O).\n2. The nitrile group (CN) is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid group (COOH) by the addition of water and a proton from the acid.\n3. The resulting compound is phenylalanine (C6H5CH2CH(NH2)COOH).\n\nIn summary, the synthesis of phenylalanine from benzyl chloride and ammonia involves the formation of benzylamine, followed by the reaction with cyanogen bromide to form phenylacetonitrile, and finally, hydrolysis of phenylacetonitrile to obtain phenylalanine."
