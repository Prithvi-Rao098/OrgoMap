    "message_2": "The molecular geometry of SCl4 (sulfur tetrachloride) can be determined using the VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) theory. \n\nFirst, let's determine the central atom, which is sulfur (S) in this case. Next, we need to find the number of valence electrons for sulfur and chlorine. Sulfur has 6 valence electrons, and chlorine has 7 valence electrons. Since there are 4 chlorine atoms, the total number of valence electrons in the molecule is 6 + 4(7) = 34.\n\nNow, we'll distribute these electrons in the molecule. Sulfur will form single bonds with each of the 4 chlorine atoms, using 8 electrons. This leaves 26 electrons, which will be distributed as lone pairs on the chlorine atoms. Each chlorine atom will have 3 lone pairs, using up 24 electrons, and the remaining 2 electrons will be a lone pair on the sulfur atom.\n\nConsidering the lone pairs and bonding pairs around the central sulfur atom, we have a total of 5 electron groups (4 bonding pairs and 1 lone pair). According to the VSEPR theory, this arrangement corresponds to a trigonal bipyramidal electron geometry. However, since there is a lone pair on the sulfur atom, the molecular geometry will be \"see-saw\" or \"distorted tetrahedral\" shape.\n\nTo determine the polarity of SCl4, we need to consider the electronegativity difference between sulfur and chlorine. Chlorine is more electronegative than sulfur, so the S-Cl bonds are polar. However, due to the see-saw molecular geometry, the bond dipoles do not cancel each other out, resulting in a net molecular dipole moment. Therefore, SCl4 is a polar molecule."
