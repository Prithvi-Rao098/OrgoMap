    "message_2": "To calculate the bond dissociation energy of the CO molecule, we can use the Morse potential equation:\n\nE = D_e * (1 - exp(-a(r - r_e)))^2\n\nwhere E is the bond dissociation energy, D_e is the dissociation energy at equilibrium, a is the Morse parameter, r is the bond length, and r_e is the equilibrium bond length.\n\nHowever, we do not have enough information to directly calculate the bond dissociation energy using the Morse potential equation. We can only estimate the bond dissociation energy using the given electron affinities of carbon and oxygen.\n\nThe bond dissociation energy can be estimated as the difference between the electron affinities of the two atoms:\n\nBond dissociation energy ≈ |Electron affinity of carbon - Electron affinity of oxygen|\n\nBond dissociation energy ≈ |-154 kJ/mol - (-141 kJ/mol)|\n\nBond dissociation energy ≈ |13 kJ/mol|\n\nThis is a rough estimation of the bond dissociation energy of the CO molecule, which is approximately 13 kJ/mol. Keep in mind that this is not an accurate value, as it does not take into account other factors such as the bond length and the Morse potential equation."
