    "message_2": "To determine the enthalpy of desorption for ammonia molecules adsorbed on the surface of activated carbon, we need to know the initial and final states of the ammonia molecule and the specific enthalpy values associated with these states.\n\nInitial state: Ammonia molecules are adsorbed on the surface of activated carbon. This state is characterized by a specific enthalpy value, H_initial.\n\nFinal state: Ammonia molecules are desorbed from the surface of activated carbon and are in the gas phase. This state is characterized by a specific enthalpy value, H_final.\n\nEnthalpy of desorption (ΔH_desorption) is the difference between the enthalpy values of the final and initial states:\n\nΔH_desorption = H_final - H_initial\n\nUnfortunately, without the specific enthalpy values for the initial and final states, we cannot calculate the enthalpy of desorption directly. These values are typically determined experimentally or through computational simulations.\n\nHowever, if you have access to the specific enthalpy values for the initial and final states, you can use the formula above to calculate the enthalpy of desorption for ammonia molecules adsorbed on the surface of activated carbon at 298 K and 1 atm."
