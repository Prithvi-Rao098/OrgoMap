    "message_2": "The standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) of a compound is the change in enthalpy when 1 mole of the compound is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states at a specified temperature and pressure, which is usually 25°C and 1 atm.\n\nFor methane (CH4), the formation reaction is:\n\nC(s) + 2H2(g) -> CH4(g)\n\nThe given enthalpy change for this reaction is -74.8 kJ/mol. Since this reaction represents the formation of 1 mole of methane from its constituent elements in their standard states, the standard enthalpy of formation of methane (ΔHf°) is equal to the enthalpy change of this reaction.\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy of formation of methane (CH4) at 25°C and 1 atm is -74.8 kJ/mol."
