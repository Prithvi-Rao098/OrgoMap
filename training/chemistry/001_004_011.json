    "message_2": "When ethanol (CH3CH2OH) reacts with acetic acid (CH3COOH), the functional groups involved are the hydroxyl group (-OH) in ethanol and the carboxyl group (-COOH) in acetic acid. The reaction takes place in the presence of concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4), which acts as a catalyst and dehydrating agent.\n\nThe reaction mechanism is an esterification reaction, specifically a Fischer esterification. In this reaction, the hydroxyl group of ethanol reacts with the carboxyl group of acetic acid to form an ester (ethyl acetate) and water as a byproduct.\n\nThe mechanism proceeds as follows:\n\n1. Protonation of the carbonyl oxygen in the carboxyl group of acetic acid by sulfuric acid, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic.\n2. Nucleophilic attack of the oxygen atom in the hydroxyl group of ethanol on the carbonyl carbon of the protonated acetic acid, forming a tetrahedral intermediate.\n3. Proton transfer from the newly formed hydroxyl group in the tetrahedral intermediate to a nearby oxygen atom, facilitated by the sulfuric acid.\n4. Elimination of water from the tetrahedral intermediate, forming a double bond between the carbonyl carbon and oxygen, and generating the ester (ethyl acetate).\n\nThe overall reaction is:\n\nCH3CH2OH + CH3COOH â†’ CH3COOCH2CH3 + H2O\n\nIn summary, the functional groups involved are the hydroxyl group in ethanol and the carboxyl group in acetic acid. The reaction mechanism is a Fischer esterification, resulting in the formation of ethyl acetate and water."
