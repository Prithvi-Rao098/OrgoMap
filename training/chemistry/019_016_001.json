    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the vaporization of 15 grams of water, we first need to determine the number of moles of water present. The molar mass of water is 18.015 g/mol.\n\nNumber of moles = (mass of water) / (molar mass of water)\nNumber of moles = (15 g) / (18.015 g/mol) = 0.8326 mol\n\nNow, we can use the molar enthalpy of vaporization to find the standard enthalpy change for the vaporization of 15 grams of water.\n\nStandard enthalpy change = (number of moles) × (molar enthalpy of vaporization)\nStandard enthalpy change = (0.8326 mol) × (40.7 kJ/mol) = 33.89 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the vaporization of 15 grams of water at its boiling point is approximately 33.89 kJ."
