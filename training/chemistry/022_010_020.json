    "message_1": "A chemistry student needs to determine the precipitate formed when 50 mL of 0.2 M silver nitrate solution is mixed with 75 mL of 0.1 M potassium chloride solution. What is the mass of the precipitate formed and what is the percent yield of the reaction?",
    "message_2": "To determine the mass of the precipitate formed, we first need to identify the reaction taking place. The reaction between silver nitrate (AgNO3) and potassium chloride (KCl) is a double displacement reaction, which forms silver chloride (AgCl) as a precipitate and potassium nitrate (KNO3) in solution:\n\nAgNO3(aq) + KCl(aq) → AgCl(s) + KNO3(aq)\n\nNext, we need to determine the limiting reactant. We can do this by calculating the moles of each reactant and comparing their mole ratios.\n\nMoles of AgNO3 = (volume × concentration) = (50 mL × 0.2 M) = 10 mmol\nMoles of KCl = (volume × concentration) = (75 mL × 0.1 M) = 7.5 mmol\n\nThe stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, so we can see that KCl is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow, we can calculate the moles of AgCl formed, which will be equal to the moles of the limiting reactant (KCl):\n\nMoles of AgCl = 7.5 mmol\n\nTo find the mass of the precipitate, we need to convert moles of AgCl to grams using the molar mass of AgCl (143.32 g/mol):\n\nMass of AgCl = (moles × molar mass) = (7.5 mmol × 143.32 g/mol) = 1074.9 mg\n\nSo, the mass of the precipitate formed is 1074.9 mg.\n\nTo calculate the percent yield, we need to know the theoretical yield and the actual yield. In this case, we don't have information about the actual yield, so we cannot calculate the percent yield. If the actual yield was provided, the percent yield could be calculated using the formula:\n\nPercent yield = (actual yield / theoretical yield) × 100%"
