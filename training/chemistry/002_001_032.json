    "message_2": "The unbalanced chemical equation for the reaction between iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) and carbon monoxide (CO) producing iron (Fe) and carbon dioxide (CO2) is:\n\nFe2O3 + CO → Fe + CO2\n\nTo balance the equation, we need to ensure that the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of the equation. \n\nFirst, balance the iron (Fe) atoms:\n2Fe2O3 + CO → 4Fe + CO2\n\nNext, balance the carbon (C) atoms:\n2Fe2O3 + 3CO → 4Fe + 3CO2\n\nFinally, balance the oxygen (O) atoms:\n2Fe2O3 + 3CO → 4Fe + 3CO2\n\nThe balanced chemical equation is:\n\n2Fe2O3 + 3CO → 4Fe + 3CO2"
