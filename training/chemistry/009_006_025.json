    "message_2": "To identify the isotope notation, we need to determine the element and its atomic number. The mass number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom. We are given the mass number (A = 39) and the number of neutrons (N = 20). We can use this information to find the number of protons (Z).\n\nA = Z + N\n\n39 = Z + 20\n\nZ = 39 - 20\n\nZ = 19\n\nThe atomic number (Z) is 19, which corresponds to the element potassium (K). Now we can write the isotope notation as follows:\n\nK-39 or ³⁹₁₉K"
