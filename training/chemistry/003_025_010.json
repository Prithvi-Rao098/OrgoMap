    "message_1": "What is the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction of nitrogen monoxide (NO) and oxygen (O2) to form nitrogen dioxide (NO2) at 25°C, if the concentration of NO is 0.25 M, the concentration of O2 is 0.10 M and the concentration of NO2 is 0.15 M? \n\nThe balanced equation for this reaction is:\n\n2NO(g) + O2(g) ⇌ 2NO2(g)",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction, we can use the formula:\n\nKc = [NO2]^2 / ([NO]^2 × [O2])\n\nGiven the concentrations of the reactants and products at equilibrium:\n\n[NO] = 0.25 M\n[O2] = 0.10 M\n[NO2] = 0.15 M\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nKc = (0.15)^2 / ((0.25)^2 × (0.10))\n\nKc = 0.0225 / (0.0625 × 0.10)\n\nKc = 0.0225 / 0.00625\n\nKc ≈ 3.6\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction at 25°C is approximately 3.6."
