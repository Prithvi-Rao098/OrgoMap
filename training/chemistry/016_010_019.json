    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change when 50 g of NaOH is dissolved in 500 mL of water at 25°C, we need to consider the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the moles of NaOH.\n2. Use the standard enthalpy of formation values for NaOH and H2O.\n3. Calculate the enthalpy change using the moles of NaOH and the enthalpy of formation values.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the moles of NaOH\nThe molar mass of NaOH = 22.99 (Na) + 15.999 (O) + 1.007 (H) = 39.996 g/mol\nMoles of NaOH = mass / molar mass = 50 g / 39.996 g/mol = 1.250 mol\n\nStep 2: Use the standard enthalpy of formation values\nThe standard enthalpy of formation of NaOH (aq) = -469.15 kJ/mol\nThe standard enthalpy of formation of H2O (l) = -285.83 kJ/mol\n\nStep 3: Calculate the enthalpy change\nThe dissolution of NaOH in water can be represented by the following reaction:\n\nNaOH (s) → NaOH (aq)\n\nThe enthalpy change for this reaction can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nΔH = ΔH(products) - ΔH(reactants)\n\nIn this case, the reactant is NaOH (s) and the product is NaOH (aq). Since the enthalpy of formation of NaOH (s) is considered to be zero (by definition for elements in their standard state), the equation becomes:\n\nΔH = ΔH(NaOH (aq)) - ΔH(NaOH (s))\nΔH = -469.15 kJ/mol - 0 kJ/mol\nΔH = -469.15 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the dissolution of 1.250 mol of NaOH:\n\nΔH_total = ΔH * moles of NaOH\nΔH_total = -469.15 kJ/mol * 1.250 mol\nΔH_total = -586.44 kJ\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy change when 50 g of NaOH is dissolved in 500 mL of water at 25°C is approximately -586.44 kJ."
