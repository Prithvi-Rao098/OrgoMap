    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the fusion reaction of 2.5 grams of ice at 0 degrees Celsius, we need to use the formula:\n\nΔH = m × ΔHfus\n\nwhere ΔH is the enthalpy change, m is the mass of the ice, and ΔHfus is the enthalpy of fusion for water.\n\nThe enthalpy of fusion for water is 6.01 kJ/mol (the energy required to convert 1 mole of ice to water at 0 degrees Celsius).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of ice (2.5 grams) to moles. The molar mass of water (H2O) is 18.015 g/mol.\n\nmoles of ice = (2.5 g) / (18.015 g/mol) = 0.1387 mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change:\n\nΔH = (0.1387 mol) × (6.01 kJ/mol) = 0.833 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the fusion reaction of 2.5 grams of ice at 0 degrees Celsius is 0.833 kJ."
