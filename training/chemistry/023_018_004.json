    "message_2": "To prepare 2,4-dinitrophenol using the nitration reaction method, the correct ratio of phenol to nitric acid is 1:2, as two nitro groups (-NO2) will be added to the phenol molecule.\n\nThe optimal reaction conditions for this process are as follows:\n\n1. Temperature: The reaction should be carried out at a low temperature, preferably between 0°C and 5°C. This is because the nitration reaction is exothermic, and higher temperatures can lead to the formation of undesired by-products, such as 2,4,6-trinitrophenol.\n\n2. Concentration of nitric acid: Use concentrated nitric acid (approximately 65-70% HNO3) for the reaction.\n\n3. Catalyst: Sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is often used as a catalyst in nitration reactions. The use of a 1:1 ratio of nitric acid to sulfuric acid is recommended.\n\n4. Reaction time: The reaction should be allowed to proceed for a sufficient amount of time to ensure complete nitration of the phenol. This can vary depending on the specific conditions, but generally, a reaction time of 1-2 hours is sufficient.\n\n5. Mixing: The reactants should be mixed slowly and carefully to avoid a rapid increase in temperature and the formation of undesired by-products.\n\nFollowing these reaction conditions should result in the preparation of 2,4-dinitrophenol in high yield and purity."
