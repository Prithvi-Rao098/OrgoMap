    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH°(reaction) = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants)\n\nFor the given reaction, N2(g) + 3H2(g) → 2NH3(g), we have:\n\nΔHf°(N2) = 0 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(H2) = 0 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(NH3) = -46.2 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔH°(reaction) = [2 * ΔHf°(NH3)] - [1 * ΔHf°(N2) + 3 * ΔHf°(H2)]\n\nΔH°(reaction) = [2 * (-46.2 kJ/mol)] - [1 * (0 kJ/mol) + 3 * (0 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH°(reaction) = (-92.4 kJ/mol) - (0 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH°(reaction) = -92.4 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change for the reaction is -92.4 kJ/mol."
