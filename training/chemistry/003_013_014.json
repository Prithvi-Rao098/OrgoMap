    "message_2": "To find the maximum work that can be obtained from a non-equilibrium thermodynamic system undergoing an irreversible process, we can use the formula:\n\nW_max = -T * ΔS\n\nwhere W_max is the maximum work, T is the temperature of the system, and ΔS is the entropy change in the system.\n\nGiven the temperature T = 300 K and the entropy change ΔS = 50 J/K, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nW_max = - (300 K) * (50 J/K)\n\nW_max = -15000 J\n\nThe maximum work that can be obtained from this non-equilibrium thermodynamic system undergoing an irreversible process is -15,000 Joules. The negative sign indicates that work is being done on the system rather than being extracted from it."
