    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the dissolution of 3 mol of potassium chloride (KCl) in 1000 mL of water, we can use the given molar enthalpy of dissolution.\n\nMolar enthalpy of dissolution = -17.4 kJ/mol\n\nWe have 3 mol of KCl, so we can multiply the molar enthalpy of dissolution by the number of moles to find the total enthalpy change:\n\nStandard enthalpy change = (molar enthalpy of dissolution) × (number of moles)\nStandard enthalpy change = (-17.4 kJ/mol) × (3 mol)\n\nStandard enthalpy change = -52.2 kJ\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change for the dissolution of 3 mol of potassium chloride in 1000 mL of water is -52.2 kJ."
