    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will need to use stoichiometry, which involves using the balanced chemical equation to determine the mass of bromine required to prepare 25 grams of 4-bromoacetanilide.\n\nFirst, let's write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nAcetanilide (C8H9NO) + Br2 â†’ 4-bromoacetanilide (C8H8BrNO) + HBr\n\nNow, we need to determine the molar mass of acetanilide, 4-bromoacetanilide, and bromine:\n\nAcetanilide: (12.01 * 8) + (1.01 * 9) + (14.01 * 1) + (16.00 * 1) = 135.17 g/mol\n4-bromoacetanilide: (12.01 * 8) + (1.01 * 8) + (79.90 * 1) + (14.01 * 1) + (16.00 * 1) = 214.07 g/mol\nBromine (Br2): 2 * 79.90 = 159.80 g/mol\n\nNow, we can use stoichiometry to determine the mass of bromine required to prepare 25 grams of 4-bromoacetanilide:\n\n1. Convert the mass of 4-bromoacetanilide to moles:\n25 g / 214.07 g/mol = 0.1167 mol\n\n2. Use the stoichiometry from the balanced equation:\n1 mol Acetanilide : 1 mol Br2 : 1 mol 4-bromoacetanilide\n\n3. Calculate the moles of bromine required:\n0.1167 mol 4-bromoacetanilide * (1 mol Br2 / 1 mol 4-bromoacetanilide) = 0.1167 mol Br2\n\n4. Convert the moles of bromine to mass:\n0.1167 mol Br2 * 159.80 g/mol = 18.65 g\n\nTherefore, 18.65 grams of bromine (Br2) are required to prepare 25 grams of 4-bromoacetanilide from acetanilide."
