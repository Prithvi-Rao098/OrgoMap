    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic moment of cobalt(II) chloride hexahydrate, we first need to determine the number of unpaired electrons in the cobalt(II) ion (Co²⁺).\n\nCobalt has an atomic number of 27, and its electron configuration is [Ar] 3d⁷ 4s². When cobalt loses two electrons to form the Co²⁺ ion, its electron configuration becomes [Ar] 3d⁷. In the octahedral complex [CoCl₂(H₂O)₄]²⁺, the cobalt(II) ion is surrounded by six ligands (four water molecules and two chloride ions). The ligand field splitting in an octahedral complex separates the five 3d orbitals into two sets: three lower-energy t₂g orbitals and two higher-energy e_g orbitals.\n\nIn a weak-field or high-spin complex, the unpaired electrons will fill the t₂g orbitals before pairing up in the e_g orbitals. In a strong-field or low-spin complex, the unpaired electrons will pair up in the t₂g orbitals before occupying the e_g orbitals. The nature of the ligands (weak field or strong field) determines whether the complex is high-spin or low-spin.\n\nWater and chloride are generally considered weak-field ligands, so we can assume that the [CoCl₂(H₂O)₄]²⁺ complex is a high-spin complex. This means that the seven 3d electrons will fill the t₂g orbitals first, resulting in the following electron configuration: t₂g↑↑↑ e_g↑↑↑↑. There are three unpaired electrons in the cobalt(II) ion.\n\nNow that we know the number of unpaired electrons (n), we can calculate the magnetic moment (μ) using the formula:\n\nμ = √(n(n+2)) Bohr magnetons\n\nμ = √(3(3+2)) = √15 ≈ 3.87 Bohr magnetons\n\nSo, the magnetic moment of cobalt(II) chloride hexahydrate, [CoCl₂(H₂O)₄]Cl₂, at room temperature is approximately 3.87 Bohr magnetons."
