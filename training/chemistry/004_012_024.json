    "message_2": "To determine the percentage composition of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen in a sample of caffeine, we first need to know the molecular formula of caffeine, which is C8H10N4O2. Next, we need to calculate the molar mass of caffeine and the individual elements.\n\nMolar mass of caffeine:\nCarbon (C): 8 atoms × 12.01 g/mol = 96.08 g/mol\nHydrogen (H): 10 atoms × 1.01 g/mol = 10.10 g/mol\nNitrogen (N): 4 atoms × 14.01 g/mol = 56.04 g/mol\nOxygen (O): 2 atoms × 16.00 g/mol = 32.00 g/mol\n\nTotal molar mass of caffeine = 96.08 + 10.10 + 56.04 + 32.00 = 194.22 g/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the percentage composition of each element:\n\nCarbon (C) percentage:\n(96.08 g/mol ÷ 194.22 g/mol) × 100 = 49.48 %\n\nHydrogen (H) percentage:\n(10.10 g/mol ÷ 194.22 g/mol) × 100 = 5.20 %\n\nNitrogen (N) percentage:\n(56.04 g/mol ÷ 194.22 g/mol) × 100 = 28.85 %\n\nSo, the percentage composition of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen in a sample of caffeine is approximately 49.48% carbon, 5.20% hydrogen, and 28.85% nitrogen."
