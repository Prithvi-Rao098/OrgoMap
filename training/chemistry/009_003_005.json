    "message_2": "The nuclear fission of uranium-235 (U-235) is a reaction in which the nucleus of a U-235 atom absorbs a neutron and becomes unstable, causing it to split into two smaller nuclei, along with the release of energy and additional neutrons. The equation for this reaction is:\n\nU-235 + n -> Ba-144 + Kr-89 + 3n + energy\n\nIn this equation, U-235 represents uranium-235, n represents a neutron, Ba-144 represents barium-144, and Kr-89 represents krypton-89. The products of this reaction are barium-144, krypton-89, and three neutrons. It is important to note that the fission of U-235 can produce various fission products, and the above equation is just one example of the possible outcomes.\n\nThe energy released in the form of heat and radiation during nuclear fission is used in practical applications such as nuclear power plants. In a nuclear power plant, the heat generated from the fission of U-235 is used to produce steam, which then drives turbines connected to electrical generators. This process converts the nuclear energy into electrical energy, which can be distributed through the power grid.\n\nThe additional neutrons released during the fission reaction can also be absorbed by other U-235 nuclei, causing a chain reaction. This chain reaction is controlled in a nuclear power plant by using control rods made of materials that absorb neutrons, such as boron or cadmium. By adjusting the position of these control rods, operators can control the rate of the fission reaction and maintain a stable and continuous production of energy."
