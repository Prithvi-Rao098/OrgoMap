    "message_2": "Ibuprofen is an arylpropionic acid derivative with the IUPAC name 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanoic acid. To design a retrosynthesis pathway for the synthesis of ibuprofen from starting materials with no more than 6 carbons, we can break down the molecule into simpler precursors. Here's a possible retrosynthesis pathway:\n\n1. Disconnection of the carboxylic acid group (COOH) from the ibuprofen molecule:\n   Target molecule: Ibuprofen (2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanoic acid)\n   Retrosynthetic step: 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanal + CO2\n\n2. Disconnection of the isobutyl group from the 4-isobutylphenyl moiety:\n   Target molecule: 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanal\n   Retrosynthetic step: 4-Isobutylbenzaldehyde + Propionaldehyde\n\n3. Disconnection of the benzene ring from the 4-isobutylbenzaldehyde:\n   Target molecule: 4-Isobutylbenzaldehyde\n   Retrosynthetic step: Benzaldehyde + Isobutylene\n\nStarting materials:\n1. Benzaldehyde (C7H6O)\n2. Isobutylene (C4H8)\n3. Propionaldehyde (C3H6O)\n4. CO2 (Carbon dioxide)\n\nSynthesis pathway:\n1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzaldehyde with isobutylene to form 4-isobutylbenzaldehyde.\n2. Wittig reaction between 4-isobutylbenzaldehyde and propionaldehyde to form 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanal.\n3. Arndt-Eistert homologation of 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanal to form ibuprofen (2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanoic acid).\n\nThis retrosynthesis pathway provides a route to synthesize ibuprofen from starting materials with no more than 6 carbons."
