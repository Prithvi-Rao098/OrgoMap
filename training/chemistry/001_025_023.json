    "message_2": "The primary structure of proteins refers to the linear sequence of amino acids that make up the polypeptide chain. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, and they are linked together by peptide bonds to form a polypeptide chain. The primary structure is determined by the specific order of amino acids, which is encoded by the genetic information in DNA.\n\nThe primary structure is crucial for the protein's biological function because it determines the overall shape and folding of the protein. The sequence of amino acids influences the formation of secondary structures, such as alpha-helices and beta-sheets, and tertiary structures, which are the three-dimensional folding patterns of the protein. These higher-order structures are essential for the protein's function, as they create specific binding sites, catalytic sites, and other functional regions.\n\nAny change or mutation in the primary structure can potentially affect the protein's function. A single amino acid substitution can alter the protein's folding, stability, or interaction with other molecules, leading to loss of function or even causing diseases. For example, sickle cell anemia is caused by a single amino acid substitution in the hemoglobin protein, which leads to the formation of abnormal red blood cells.\n\nIn summary, the primary structure of proteins is the linear sequence of amino acids that make up the polypeptide chain. This sequence determines the protein's higher-order structures and ultimately its biological function. Changes in the primary structure can have significant effects on the protein's function and may lead to diseases or loss of function."
