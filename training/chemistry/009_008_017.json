    "message_2": "The efficiency of a radiation detector is calculated by dividing the observed count rate by the source decay rate.\n\nEfficiency = (Observed count rate) / (Source decay rate)\n\nIn this case, the observed count rate is 500 counts per minute, and the source decay rate is 5000 decays per minute.\n\nEfficiency = (500 counts per minute) / (5000 decays per minute)\n\nEfficiency = 0.1 or 10%\n\nThe efficiency of the radiation detector is 10%."
