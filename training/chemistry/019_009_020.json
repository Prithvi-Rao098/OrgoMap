    "message_1": "What is the standard free energy change for the redox reaction of copper (II) oxide (CuO) and hydrogen gas (H2) to form copper metal (Cu) and water (H2O), given that the standard reduction potentials are: \nCu2+ + 2e- --> Cu (E° = +0.34 V) \n2H+ + 2e- --> H2 (E° = 0 V)",
    "message_2": "First, we need to write the balanced redox reaction. The given half-reactions are:\n\nCu2+ + 2e- --> Cu (E° = +0.34 V)\n2H+ + 2e- --> H2 (E° = 0 V)\n\nSince we are given copper (II) oxide (CuO) and hydrogen gas (H2) as reactants, we need to modify the half-reactions to include these species. We can do this by adding water and hydroxide ions:\n\nCuO + 2H+ + 2e- --> Cu + H2O (E° = +0.34 V)\nH2 + 2OH- --> 2H2O + 2e- (E° = -0.00 V)\n\nNow we can combine the half-reactions:\n\nCuO + 2H+ + 2e- + H2 + 2OH- --> Cu + H2O + 2H2O + 2e-\n\nSimplifying and canceling out the electrons, we get:\n\nCuO + H2 --> Cu + H2O\n\nNow we can calculate the standard free energy change (ΔG°) using the Nernst equation:\n\nΔG° = -nFE°\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of electrons transferred (in this case, 2), F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol), and E° is the standard cell potential.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard cell potential (E°) for the overall reaction. Since the second half-reaction has been reversed, we need to subtract its potential from the first half-reaction's potential:\n\nE° = (+0.34 V) - (0 V) = +0.34 V\n\nNow we can calculate the standard free energy change (ΔG°):\n\nΔG° = -2 * 96,485 C/mol * 0.34 V\nΔG° = -65,609.4 J/mol\n\nSo the standard free energy change for the redox reaction of copper (II) oxide (CuO) and hydrogen gas (H2) to form copper metal (Cu) and water (H2O) is -65,609.4 J/mol."
