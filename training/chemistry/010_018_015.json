    "message_2": "To calculate the corrosion potential of the copper electrode, we can use the Nernst equation:\n\nE = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\n\nwhere:\nE = corrosion potential\nE° = standard reduction potential of Cu2+/Cu = +0.34 V\nR = gas constant = 8.314 J/(mol·K)\nT = temperature in Kelvin = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\nn = number of electrons transferred in the redox reaction (for Cu2+/Cu, n = 2)\nF = Faraday's constant = 96485 C/mol\nQ = reaction quotient = [Cu2+]/[Cu]\n\nSince the pH of the solution is 4.5, we can assume that the concentration of H+ ions does not significantly affect the concentration of Cu2+ ions. Therefore, we can use the given concentration of copper(II) sulfate (0.10 M) as the concentration of Cu2+ ions. Since the copper electrode is a solid, its concentration is not included in the reaction quotient. Thus, Q = [Cu2+] = 0.10 M.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Nernst equation:\n\nE = 0.34 V - (8.314 J/(mol·K) * 298.15 K / (2 * 96485 C/mol)) * ln(0.10 M)\nE = 0.34 V - (0.01299 V) * ln(0.10)\nE = 0.34 V + 0.02997 V\nE = 0.36997 V\n\nThe corrosion potential of the copper electrode immersed in a 0.10 M solution of copper(II) sulfate at 25°C and pH 4.5 is approximately 0.37 V."
