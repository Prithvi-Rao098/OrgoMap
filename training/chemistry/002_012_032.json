    "message_2": "In carbon dioxide (CO2), there are two carbon-oxygen double bonds. The molecule has a linear structure with the carbon atom in the center and the two oxygen atoms on either side. Each carbon-oxygen bond consists of one sigma (σ) bond and one pi (π) bond.\n\nThe bond order is the number of chemical bonds between a pair of atoms. In CO2, the bond order of the carbon-oxygen double bond is 2, as there are two bonds (one σ and one π bond) between the carbon and each oxygen atom.\n\nThe bond length is the distance between the nuclei of two bonded atoms. The bond length of the carbon-oxygen double bond in CO2 is approximately 1.16 Å (angstroms), which is shorter than a carbon-oxygen single bond (approximately 1.43 Å) but longer than a carbon-oxygen triple bond (approximately 1.08 Å). This is because double bonds are stronger and pull the atoms closer together compared to single bonds, while triple bonds are even stronger and pull the atoms even closer."
