    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the formation of ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) from its constituent elements, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH°(reaction) = Σ ΔH°f(products) - Σ ΔH°f(reactants)\n\nIn this case, the reactants are N2(g), H2(g), and Cl2(g), and the product is NH4Cl(s). The standard enthalpy of formation for the reactants is 0 kJ/mol, and for NH4Cl, it is -314.4 kJ/mol.\n\nSince the reaction equation is: N2(g) + 4H2(g) + 2Cl2(g) → 2NH4Cl(s), we need to multiply the standard enthalpy of formation for NH4Cl by 2 to account for the stoichiometry of the reaction.\n\nΔH°(reaction) = [2 × (-314.4 kJ/mol)] - [0 kJ/mol + 0 kJ/mol + 0 kJ/mol]\nΔH°(reaction) = -628.8 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the formation of ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) from its constituent elements is -628.8 kJ/mol."
