    "message_2": "In an irreversible process, the change in entropy of the system can be calculated using the formula:\n\nΔS = ΔS_high + ΔS_low\n\nWhere ΔS_high is the change in entropy of the high-temperature reservoir, and ΔS_low is the change in entropy of the low-temperature reservoir.\n\nFor heat transfer, the change in entropy can be calculated using the formula:\n\nΔS = Q/T\n\nWhere Q is the heat transferred and T is the temperature.\n\nFor the high-temperature reservoir, the heat transferred is -1500 J (since it loses heat), and the temperature is 600 K. So, the change in entropy for the high-temperature reservoir is:\n\nΔS_high = (-1500 J) / (600 K) = -2.5 J/K\n\nFor the low-temperature reservoir, the heat transferred is 1500 J (since it gains heat), and the temperature is 300 K. So, the change in entropy for the low-temperature reservoir is:\n\nΔS_low = (1500 J) / (300 K) = 5 J/K\n\nNow, we can calculate the total change in entropy of the system:\n\nΔS = ΔS_high + ΔS_low = -2.5 J/K + 5 J/K = 2.5 J/K\n\nSo, the change in entropy of the system undergoing the irreversible process is 2.5 J/K."
