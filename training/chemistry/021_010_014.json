    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question for a chemistry student to solve on determining the bond enthalpy of a molecule:\n\nDetermine the bond enthalpy of the single bond in a molecule of ethane (C2H6), if 282 kJ of energy is required to break a mole of this bond.",
    "message_2": "To determine the bond enthalpy of the single bond in a molecule of ethane (C2H6), we need to consider the energy required to break one mole of the C-C bond.\n\nEthane (C2H6) has the following structure:\n\nH H H\n| | |\nC-C\n| | |\nH H H\n\nThere is one C-C single bond in the ethane molecule.\n\nGiven that 282 kJ of energy is required to break a mole of this bond, the bond enthalpy of the single bond in a molecule of ethane is simply 282 kJ/mol."
