Given the following information: \n\n- The reaction takes place at standard conditions (298 K and 1 atm pressure).\n- The molar enthalpy of formation of calcium oxide is -635.1 kJ/mol.\n- The molar enthalpy of formation of calcium hydroxide is -986.2 kJ/mol.\n- The density of water is 1 g/mL and the specific heat of water is 4.184 J/(g*K).\n- The mass of calcium oxide used in the reaction is 10 grams and the volume of water used is 100 mL.",
    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy change for the reaction between calcium oxide and water to form calcium hydroxide, we can use Hess's Law. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nCaO (s) + H2O (l) → Ca(OH)2 (s)\n\nAccording to Hess's Law, the enthalpy change of the reaction (ΔH_rxn) is equal to the sum of the enthalpy changes of formation of the products minus the sum of the enthalpy changes of formation of the reactants:\n\nΔH_rxn = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nIn this case, the only product is calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2), and the reactants are calcium oxide (CaO) and water (H2O). The enthalpy change of formation for water is not given, but since it is in its standard state (liquid), we can assume its enthalpy change of formation is zero.\n\nUsing the given enthalpy changes of formation for calcium oxide and calcium hydroxide:\n\nΔH_rxn = [1 * (-986.2 kJ/mol)] - [1 * (-635.1 kJ/mol) + 0]\n\nΔH_rxn = -986.2 kJ/mol + 635.1 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_rxn = -351.1 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the reaction between calcium oxide and water to form calcium hydroxide is -351.1 kJ/mol."
