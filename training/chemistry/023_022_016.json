    "message_2": "To synthesize 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid from benzoic acid and nitric acid, you will need to perform a nitration reaction. The nitration of benzoic acid involves the use of a nitrating agent, typically a mixture of nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Here is a step-by-step procedure for synthesizing 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid:\n\n1. Safety precautions: Before starting the synthesis, make sure to wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), such as gloves, goggles, and a lab coat. Work in a well-ventilated area or a fume hood, as the reaction involves corrosive and toxic chemicals.\n\n2. Prepare the nitrating agent: Mix concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) in a 1:1 ratio. For example, you can use 10 mL of each acid. Slowly add the nitric acid to the sulfuric acid while stirring and cooling the mixture in an ice bath to keep the temperature below 20°C (68°F).\n\n3. Dissolve the benzoic acid: Weigh out 5 grams of benzoic acid and dissolve it in 10 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) in a round-bottom flask. Stir the mixture until the benzoic acid is completely dissolved.\n\n4. Add the nitrating agent: Slowly add the prepared nitrating agent to the benzoic acid solution while stirring and maintaining the temperature below 20°C (68°F) using an ice bath. The addition should be done dropwise and may take around 30 minutes to complete.\n\n5. Stir and heat the reaction mixture: After adding the nitrating agent, remove the ice bath and stir the reaction mixture at room temperature for 1 hour. Then, heat the mixture to 50-60°C (122-140°F) and maintain this temperature for another hour while stirring.\n\n6. Quench the reaction: Carefully pour the reaction mixture onto crushed ice and stir until the ice has melted. This will cause the 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid to precipitate out of the solution.\n\n7. Filter and wash the product: Filter the precipitate using vacuum filtration. Wash the solid product with cold water to remove any remaining acid and impurities.\n\n8. Recrystallize the product: To further purify the 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid, dissolve the solid in a minimal amount of hot ethanol. Then, slowly add hot water until the solution becomes cloudy. Allow the solution to cool to room temperature and then place it in an ice bath to complete the recrystallization process. Filter the crystals and let them air dry.\n\n9. Characterize the product: Analyze the synthesized 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid using techniques such as melting point determination, infrared spectroscopy (IR), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to confirm its identity and purity.\n\nPlease note that this procedure is for educational purposes only and should be performed by a trained chemist in a laboratory setting."
