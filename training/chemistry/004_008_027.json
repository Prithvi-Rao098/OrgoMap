    "message_1": "Which functional groups are present in compound X as determined by its infrared spectrum, and what structural features of the compound are suggested by the observed IR peaks?",
    "message_2": "As a chemist, I would need the actual infrared (IR) spectrum of compound X to provide a specific analysis of the functional groups and structural features present in the compound. However, I can provide you with a general guideline on how to interpret an IR spectrum and identify functional groups.\n\n1. Look for the presence of broad peaks around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹. This region is characteristic of O-H stretching vibrations, which can indicate the presence of alcohol (R-OH) or carboxylic acid (R-COOH) functional groups. The carboxylic acid O-H peak is usually broader and more intense than the alcohol O-H peak.\n\n2. Check for peaks around 3000-3100 cm⁻¹. This region corresponds to N-H stretching vibrations, suggesting the presence of amine (R-NH₂) or amide (R-CONH₂) functional groups.\n\n3. Examine the region around 2800-3000 cm⁻¹. Peaks in this area are indicative of C-H stretching vibrations, which can provide information about the type of hydrocarbon present (alkane, alkene, or alkyne).\n\n4. Look for peaks around 1600-1800 cm⁻¹. This region is characteristic of C=O stretching vibrations, which can indicate the presence of carbonyl-containing functional groups such as aldehydes (R-CHO), ketones (R-CO-R), carboxylic acids (R-COOH), esters (R-COO-R), or amides (R-CONH₂).\n\n5. Check for peaks around 1500-1600 cm⁻¹. This region corresponds to C=C stretching vibrations, suggesting the presence of alkene (R-CH=CH-R) functional groups.\n\n6. Examine the region around 2100-2300 cm⁻¹. Peaks in this area are indicative of C≡C or C≡N stretching vibrations, which can indicate the presence of alkyne (R-C≡C-R) or nitrile (R-C≡N) functional groups.\n\n7. Look for peaks around 1000-1300 cm⁻¹. This region is characteristic of C-O stretching vibrations, which can indicate the presence of ether (R-O-R), ester (R-COO-R), or alcohol (R-OH) functional groups.\n\nOnce you have identified the functional groups present in compound X, you can use this information to deduce possible structural features of the compound. Keep in mind that this is a general guideline, and the specific IR spectrum of compound X is required for a more accurate analysis."
