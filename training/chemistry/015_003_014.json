    "message_2": "The change in mass of an atom affects the frequency and intensity of its vibrational modes in infrared (IR) spectra because the vibrational frequency is inversely proportional to the square root of the reduced mass of the atoms involved in the bond. The reduced mass (μ) is calculated using the formula:\n\nμ = (m1 * m2) / (m1 + m2)\n\nwhere m1 and m2 are the masses of the two atoms involved in the bond.\n\nAs the mass of an atom increases, the reduced mass also increases, which results in a decrease in the vibrational frequency. This means that heavier atoms will have lower vibrational frequencies in the IR spectra. Additionally, the intensity of the vibrational modes is affected by the change in the dipole moment of the molecule during the vibration. If the vibration causes a significant change in the dipole moment, the intensity of the absorption in the IR spectrum will be higher.\n\nNow, let's calculate the vibrational frequencies and intensities of methane (CH4) and chloromethane (CH3Cl) molecules and compare how the substitution of a hydrogen with a heavier chlorine atom affects their IR spectra.\n\nMethane (CH4):\nMethane has 4 C-H bonds. The mass of carbon (C) is 12 amu, and the mass of hydrogen (H) is 1 amu. The reduced mass for the C-H bond is:\n\nμ(CH) = (12 * 1) / (12 + 1) = 12 / 13 ≈ 0.923 amu\n\nThe vibrational frequency (ν) can be calculated using Hooke's Law:\n\nν = (1 / 2π) * √(k / μ)\n\nwhere k is the force constant of the bond. For a C-H bond, the force constant is approximately 500 N/m. Converting the reduced mass to kg (1 amu = 1.66 × 10^-27 kg):\n\nμ(CH) ≈ 0.923 * 1.66 × 10^-27 ≈ 1.53 × 10^-27 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the vibrational frequency:\n\nν(CH) = (1 / 2π) * √(500 / 1.53 × 10^-27) ≈ 2.92 × 10^13 Hz\n\nChloromethane (CH3Cl):\nChloromethane has 3 C-H bonds and 1 C-Cl bond. The mass of chlorine (Cl) is 35.5 amu. The reduced mass for the C-Cl bond is:\n\nμ(CCl) = (12 * 35.5) / (12 + 35.5) ≈ 9.57 amu\n\nUsing the same method as above, we can calculate the vibrational frequency for the C-Cl bond. The force constant for a C-Cl bond is approximately 350 N/m.\n\nμ(CCl) ≈ 9.57 * 1.66 × 10^-27 ≈ 1.59 × 10^-26 kg\n\nν(CCl) = (1 / 2π) * √(350 / 1.59 × 10^-26) ≈ 1.18 × 10^13 Hz\n\nComparison:\nThe substitution of a hydrogen with a heavier chlorine atom in chloromethane results in a lower vibrational frequency for the C-Cl bond compared to the C-H bond in methane. This is due to the increased reduced mass of the C-Cl bond. The intensities of the vibrational modes will also be affected by the change in the dipole moment during the vibration. Since the electronegativity of chlorine is higher than that of hydrogen, the C-Cl bond will have a larger dipole moment, resulting in higher intensity in the IR spectrum for the C-Cl stretching mode compared to the C-H stretching mode."
