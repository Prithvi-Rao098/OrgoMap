    "message_1": "What is the current density in an electrochemical cell with a copper electrode of surface area 10 cm² and a current of 2.5 A flowing for 10 minutes? The reduction reaction at the copper electrode is Cu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Cu(s). Assume standard conditions and a 100% current efficiency.",
    "message_2": "Current density (J) is defined as the current (I) divided by the surface area (A) of the electrode. In this case, the current (I) is 2.5 A and the surface area (A) is 10 cm².\n\nTo calculate the current density, use the formula:\n\nJ = I / A\n\nFirst, we need to convert the surface area from cm² to m²:\n\n10 cm² = 0.001 m² (1 m² = 10,000 cm²)\n\nNow, we can calculate the current density:\n\nJ = 2.5 A / 0.001 m² = 2500 A/m²\n\nSo, the current density in the electrochemical cell is 2500 A/m²."
