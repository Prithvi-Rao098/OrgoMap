    "message_2": "1. Butane and Isobutane: These two compounds are structural isomers of each other. They have the same molecular formula (C4H10) but different structural arrangements. Butane has a straight-chain structure, while isobutane has a branched structure.\n\n2. Ethanol and Dimethyl Ether: These two compounds are functional isomers, specifically, they are examples of positional isomers. They have the same molecular formula (C2H6O) but different functional groups. Ethanol has an alcohol functional group (-OH), while dimethyl ether has an ether functional group (C-O-C).\n\n3. Acetic acid and Methyl Formate: These two compounds are also functional isomers, specifically, they are examples of functional group isomers. They have the same molecular formula (C2H4O2) but different functional groups. Acetic acid has a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH), while methyl formate has an ester functional group (COOCH3)."
