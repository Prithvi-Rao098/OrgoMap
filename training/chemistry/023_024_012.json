    "message_1": "How much chlorine gas (in moles or grams) is required to prepare 100 grams of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene from nitrobenzene using the reaction conditions stated in the Preparation of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene protocol?",
    "message_2": "To determine the amount of chlorine gas required to prepare 100 grams of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene from nitrobenzene, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nC₆H₅NO₂ + 2 Cl₂ → C₆H₃Cl₂NO₂\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of moles of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene (C₆H₃Cl₂NO₂) in 100 grams:\n\nMolar mass of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene = (6 × 12.01) + (3 × 1.01) + (2 × 35.45) + (1 × 14.01) + (2 × 16.00) = 202.02 g/mol\n\nMoles of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene = mass / molar mass = 100 g / 202.02 g/mol ≈ 0.495 moles\n\nFrom the balanced chemical equation, we can see that 1 mole of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene is produced from 2 moles of chlorine gas (Cl₂). Therefore, we can determine the moles of Cl₂ required:\n\nMoles of Cl₂ = 0.495 moles of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene × (2 moles of Cl₂ / 1 mole of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene) = 0.990 moles of Cl₂\n\nNow, we can convert the moles of Cl₂ to grams:\n\nMolar mass of Cl₂ = 2 × 35.45 = 70.90 g/mol\n\nMass of Cl₂ = moles × molar mass = 0.990 moles × 70.90 g/mol ≈ 70.19 grams\n\nTherefore, approximately 70.19 grams of chlorine gas is required to prepare 100 grams of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene from nitrobenzene."
