    "message_2": "When complexing with a ligand containing a carbonyl (C=O) functional group, you would expect to observe a metal carbonyl coordination compound. Metal carbonyls are coordination complexes of transition metals with carbon monoxide (CO) ligands. Some common examples include nickel tetracarbonyl (Ni(CO)4), iron pentacarbonyl (Fe(CO)5), and chromium hexacarbonyl (Cr(CO)6).\n\nIn the IR spectrum of metal carbonyl complexes, you would expect to observe characteristic vibrational bands corresponding to the stretching vibrations of the metal-carbon (M-C) and carbon-oxygen (C=O) bonds. The exact positions of these bands will depend on the specific metal and the number of carbonyl ligands in the complex.\n\nFor the C=O stretching vibrations, the bands are typically observed in the range of 1600-2200 cm-1. The exact position of the C=O stretching band depends on the nature of the metal center and the electron density on the carbonyl ligand. In general, as the electron density on the carbonyl ligand increases, the C=O stretching frequency decreases.\n\nFor the M-C stretching vibrations, the bands are typically observed in the range of 400-600 cm-1. The exact position of the M-C stretching band depends on the mass of the metal and the strength of the M-C bond. In general, as the mass of the metal increases or the M-C bond strength decreases, the M-C stretching frequency decreases.\n\nIn addition to the M-C and C=O stretching vibrations, you may also observe other vibrational bands corresponding to bending and deformation modes of the metal carbonyl complex. However, these bands are usually less intense and less diagnostic than the stretching vibrations."
