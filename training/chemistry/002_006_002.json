    "message_2": "To find the molar mass of Calcium carbonate (CaCO3), we need to add the molar masses of each element present in the compound.\n\nCalcium (Ca): 40.08 g/mol\nCarbon (C): 12.01 g/mol\nOxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol\n\nSince there are three oxygen atoms in the compound, we multiply the molar mass of oxygen by 3:\n\nCaCO3 = 40.08 (Ca) + 12.01 (C) + 16.00 (O) * 3\nCaCO3 = 40.08 + 12.01 + 48.00\nCaCO3 = 100.09 g/mol\n\nNow, to find out how many grams of CaCO3 are required to create a 0.25 mole solution, we use the formula:\n\nmass = moles × molar mass\n\nmass = 0.25 mol × 100.09 g/mol\nmass = 25.0225 g\n\nTherefore, 25.0225 grams of Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) are required to create a 0.25 mole solution."
