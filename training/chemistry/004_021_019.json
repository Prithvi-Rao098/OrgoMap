    "message_2": "The composition of a commercial sample of aspirin, also known as acetylsalicylic acid, typically consists of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and various excipients such as binders, fillers, and coatings. The exact composition may vary depending on the manufacturer and specific formulation.\n\nLiquid chromatography analysis, such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), can be used to determine the concentrations of impurities in a commercial aspirin sample. Impurities may include degradation products, residual solvents, and other related substances.\n\nThe specific concentrations of impurities in a commercial aspirin sample will depend on the quality control measures employed by the manufacturer and the storage conditions of the product. In general, the impurity levels should be within the acceptable limits set by regulatory agencies such as the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) or the European Pharmacopoeia (EP).\n\nFor example, the USP sets limits for the following impurities in aspirin:\n\n1. Salicylic acid: Not more than 0.15%\n2. Any individual unspecified impurity: Not more than 0.10%\n3. Total impurities: Not more than 0.30%\n\nTo determine the exact concentrations of impurities in a specific commercial aspirin sample, a laboratory analysis using liquid chromatography would need to be performed."
