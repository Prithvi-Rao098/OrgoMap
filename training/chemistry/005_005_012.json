    "message_2": "The differences in nucleotide composition between RNA and DNA play a significant role in their characteristics and biological functions. The primary differences between the two nucleic acids are the sugar component (ribose in RNA and deoxyribose in DNA) and one of the nitrogenous bases (uracil in RNA and thymine in DNA). These differences influence their respective biological functions in several ways:\n\n1. Stability: DNA is more stable than RNA due to the presence of deoxyribose sugar, which lacks a hydroxyl group at the 2' carbon position. This absence of a hydroxyl group makes DNA less susceptible to hydrolysis and more suitable for long-term storage of genetic information. In contrast, the presence of a hydroxyl group in RNA's ribose sugar makes it more reactive and less stable, which is suitable for its role in short-term processes like gene expression and regulation.\n\n2. Double helix vs. single-stranded structure: DNA typically exists as a double-stranded molecule, forming a stable double helix structure due to complementary base pairing (adenine with thymine, and cytosine with guanine). This structure provides a robust and accurate means of storing genetic information. RNA, on the other hand, is usually single-stranded, which allows it to fold into various secondary and tertiary structures that are essential for its diverse functions, such as catalysis, gene regulation, and protein synthesis.\n\n3. Uracil vs. thymine: The presence of uracil in RNA instead of thymine allows for more versatile base pairing and interactions with other molecules. This versatility is crucial for RNA's role in processes like translation, where it interacts with both mRNA and tRNA. Additionally, the presence of uracil in RNA and thymine in DNA provides a mechanism for distinguishing between the two types of nucleic acids during various cellular processes.\n\n4. Biological functions: The differences in nucleotide composition and structure between RNA and DNA directly influence their respective biological functions. DNA primarily serves as the long-term storage of genetic information, ensuring the accurate transmission of genetic material during cell division. RNA, on the other hand, plays a more dynamic role in gene expression, acting as a template for protein synthesis (mRNA), a carrier of amino acids (tRNA), a component of the ribosome (rRNA), and even as a catalyst (ribozymes) and gene regulator (e.g., miRNA, siRNA).\n\nIn summary, the differences in nucleotide composition between RNA and DNA significantly impact their characteristics and biological functions. DNA's stability and double helix structure make it ideal for storing genetic information, while RNA's versatility and single-stranded nature allow it to participate in various processes related to gene expression and regulation."
