    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a question for the student to solve:\n\nA zinc electrode in 1.0 M ZnSO4 solution is immersed in a beaker containing a copper electrode in 1.0 M CuSO4 solution. The initial mass of the electrodes are: Zn = 25g, Cu = 50g. What is the rate of the electrochemical reaction that occurs when the electrodes are connected by a wire and a salt bridge, and what is the final mass of the zinc electrode after 1 hour of current flow? Assume a current of 2.5 A is passed through the cell.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate of the electrochemical reaction and the final mass of the zinc electrode after 1 hour of current flow.\n\nFirst, let's write the half-reactions for the zinc and copper electrodes:\n\nZn → Zn²⁺ + 2e⁻ (oxidation at the anode)\nCu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu (reduction at the cathode)\n\nThe overall reaction is:\nZn + Cu²⁺ → Zn²⁺ + Cu\n\nNow, we need to find the number of moles of electrons transferred in the reaction. We can use Faraday's law of electrolysis:\n\nQ = n * F\n\nwhere Q is the charge, n is the number of moles of electrons, and F is Faraday's constant (96,485 C/mol).\n\nWe know the current (I) is 2.5 A, and the time (t) is 1 hour (3600 seconds). The charge (Q) can be calculated as:\n\nQ = I * t\nQ = 2.5 A * 3600 s = 9000 C\n\nNow, we can find the number of moles of electrons (n):\n\nn = Q / F\nn = 9000 C / 96,485 C/mol ≈ 0.0933 mol\n\nSince 2 moles of electrons are required for each mole of Zn oxidized, we can find the moles of Zn reacted:\n\nmoles of Zn = 0.0933 mol / 2 = 0.04665 mol\n\nNow, we can find the mass of Zn reacted:\n\nmass of Zn = moles of Zn * molar mass of Zn\nmass of Zn = 0.04665 mol * 65.38 g/mol ≈ 3.05 g\n\nFinally, we can find the final mass of the zinc electrode:\n\nfinal mass of Zn = initial mass of Zn - mass of Zn reacted\nfinal mass of Zn = 25 g - 3.05 g ≈ 21.95 g\n\nSo, the rate of the electrochemical reaction is 0.0933 mol of electrons per hour, and the final mass of the zinc electrode after 1 hour of current flow is approximately 21.95 g."
