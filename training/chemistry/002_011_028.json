    "message_2": "Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is an inorganic molecule consisting of one sulfur atom (S) and two oxygen atoms (O) bonded together. The geometry of SO2 is bent or V-shaped due to the presence of one lone pair of electrons on the sulfur atom.\n\nTo determine the polarity of SO2, we need to consider the electronegativity of the atoms involved and the molecular geometry. Oxygen is more electronegative than sulfur, so the oxygen atoms will pull the electron density towards themselves, creating a dipole moment in each S-O bond. Since the molecule has a bent geometry, these dipole moments do not cancel each other out, resulting in a net dipole moment for the entire molecule.\n\nTherefore, sulfur dioxide (SO2) has a bent geometry and is a polar molecule."
