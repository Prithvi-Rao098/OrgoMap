    "message_2": "The Lewis structure of the molecule SiO2 (silicon dioxide) is as follows:\n\n1. Count the total number of valence electrons: Silicon (Si) has 4 valence electrons, and Oxygen (O) has 6 valence electrons. Since there are two oxygen atoms, the total number of valence electrons is 4 + (2 Ã— 6) = 16.\n\n2. Place the least electronegative atom (Si) in the center and surround it with the more electronegative atoms (O).\n\n       O\n       |\n       Si\n       |\n       O\n\n3. Connect the atoms with single bonds. Each bond represents 2 electrons, so we have used 4 electrons so far.\n\n4. Distribute the remaining electrons (12) as lone pairs on the surrounding oxygen atoms to satisfy the octet rule. Each oxygen atom will have 3 lone pairs (6 electrons).\n\n       O\n     : | :\n       Si\n     : | :\n       O\n\n5. Check if the central atom (Si) has a complete octet. In this case, Si has only 4 electrons from the two single bonds. To complete the octet, we need to form double bonds between Si and each O atom.\n\n       O\n     : || :\n       Si\n     : || :\n       O\n\nNow, the Lewis structure of SiO2 is complete, with each atom having a full octet of electrons."
