    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change of dissolving NaOH in water, we can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat absorbed or released, m is the mass of the solution, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nFirst, we need to find the mass of the solution. Since we have 5.00 g of NaOH and 100.0 g of water, the total mass of the solution is:\n\nm = 5.00 g + 100.0 g = 105.0 g\n\nNext, we need to find the change in temperature, which is:\n\nΔT = T_final - T_initial = 31.50°C - 25.00°C = 6.50°C\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nq = (105.0 g)(4.18 J/g°C)(6.50°C) = 2871.7 J\n\nSince the temperature of the solution increased, the reaction is exothermic, and the enthalpy change is negative. Therefore, the enthalpy change of dissolving 5.00 g of NaOH in 100.0 g of water is:\n\nΔH = -2871.7 J"
