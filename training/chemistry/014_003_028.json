Cis isomer: In the cis isomer, the two chloride ligands are adjacent to each other on the cobalt center. The ethylenediamine ligands are also adjacent to each other.\n\n       Cl\n        |\n       Co\n      /   \\\n    en    en\n      \\   /\n       Cl\n\n2. Trans isomer: In the trans isomer, the two chloride ligands are opposite to each other on the cobalt center.
