    "message_1": "What is the mass percentage of calcium carbonate in a sample of marble chips if 2 grams of the chips were dissolved in hydrochloric acid and the resulting solution was analyzed by gravimetric analysis to yield 0.81 grams of calcium chloride?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use stoichiometry and the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and hydrochloric acid (HCl):\n\nCaCO3 + 2HCl â†’ CaCl2 + H2O + CO2\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of calcium chloride (CaCl2) produced. The molar mass of CaCl2 is 40.08 (Ca) + 2 * 35.45 (Cl) = 110.98 g/mol.\n\nMoles of CaCl2 = mass / molar mass = 0.81 g / 110.98 g/mol = 0.0073 mol\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of CaCO3 reacts to produce 1 mole of CaCl2. Therefore, the moles of CaCO3 in the marble chips are also 0.0073 mol.\n\nNow we need to find the mass of CaCO3 in the marble chips. The molar mass of CaCO3 is 40.08 (Ca) + 12.01 (C) + 3 * 16.00 (O) = 100.09 g/mol.\n\nMass of CaCO3 = moles * molar mass = 0.0073 mol * 100.09 g/mol = 0.73 g\n\nFinally, we can find the mass percentage of calcium carbonate in the marble chips:\n\nMass percentage of CaCO3 = (mass of CaCO3 / total mass of marble chips) * 100\nMass percentage of CaCO3 = (0.73 g / 2 g) * 100 = 36.5%\n\nThe mass percentage of calcium carbonate in the sample of marble chips is 36.5%."
