    "message_1": "What is the purity of a sample of aspirin if its melting point is 134.5°C, compared to the literature value of 136°C? Calculate the percentage purity of the sample using the melting point range and known literature values.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the percentage purity of the aspirin sample, we can use the following formula:\n\nPercentage Purity = (Observed Melting Point / Literature Melting Point) × 100\n\nIn this case, the observed melting point is 134.5°C, and the literature melting point is 136°C. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nPercentage Purity = (134.5 / 136) × 100\nPercentage Purity ≈ 98.9%\n\nTherefore, the purity of the aspirin sample is approximately 98.9%."
