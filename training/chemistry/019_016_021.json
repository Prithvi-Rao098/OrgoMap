    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the vaporization of 10 grams of water, we first need to determine the number of moles of water present. \n\nThe molar mass of water (H₂O) is approximately 18.015 g/mol (1.008 g/mol for hydrogen and 15.999 g/mol for oxygen).\n\nNumber of moles (n) = mass (m) / molar mass (M)\nn = 10 g / 18.015 g/mol\nn ≈ 0.555 moles of water\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard enthalpy change (ΔH) using the enthalpy of vaporization (ΔH_vap) and the number of moles (n).\n\nΔH = n * ΔH_vap\nΔH = 0.555 moles * 40.7 kJ/mol\nΔH ≈ 22.59 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the vaporization of 10 grams of water at 100°C is approximately 22.59 kJ."
