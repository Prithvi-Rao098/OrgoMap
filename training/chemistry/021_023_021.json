    "message_2": "Geometrical isomers, also known as cis-trans isomers or configurational isomers, are a type of stereoisomerism where molecules have the same molecular formula and the same order of atoms but differ in their spatial arrangement. Geometrical isomers occur when there is restricted rotation around a bond, such as a double bond or a single bond in a cyclic compound.\n\nTo determine whether a molecule has geometrical isomers, we need to look for the presence of a double bond or a ring structure and check if there are two different groups or atoms attached to each carbon atom involved in the double bond or ring. If these conditions are met, the molecule can have geometrical isomers.\n\nFor example, let's consider alkenes, which are hydrocarbons with a carbon-carbon double bond. The double bond restricts the rotation of the atoms around it, which can lead to different spatial arrangements of the atoms or groups attached to the carbons involved in the double bond.\n\nCis and trans isomers are types of geometrical isomers found in alkenes. The difference between them lies in the relative positions of the substituents attached to the double-bonded carbons:\n\n1. Cis isomers: In cis isomers, the two similar or identical groups or atoms are on the same side of the double bond. This results in a polar molecule, as the distribution of electron density is uneven.\n\nExample: Cis-2-butene (CH3-CH=CH-CH3) has both methyl groups (CH3) on the same side of the double bond.\n\n2. Trans isomers: In trans isomers, the two similar or identical groups or atoms are on opposite sides of the double bond. This results in a nonpolar molecule, as the distribution of electron density is more even.\n\nExample: Trans-2-butene (CH3-CH=CH-CH3) has the methyl groups (CH3) on opposite sides of the double bond.\n\nThe differences between cis and trans isomers can lead to different physical and chemical properties, such as melting points, boiling points, and reactivity. For instance, cis isomers generally have lower melting points and boiling points than their trans counterparts due to their polar nature and weaker intermolecular forces.\n\nIn summary, to determine whether a molecule has geometrical isomers, look for restricted rotation around a bond and different groups or atoms attached to the carbons involved in that bond. Cis and trans isomers of alkenes are examples of geometrical isomers, differing in the spatial arrangement of substituents around the double bond, which can lead to different properties and reactivity."
