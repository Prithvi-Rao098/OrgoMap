    "message_2": "The reaction between benzene and nitric acid to produce nitrobenzene is an example of electrophilic aromatic substitution. The mechanism involves the following steps:\n\n1. Formation of the electrophile: Nitric acid (HNO3) reacts with a strong acid, typically sulfuric acid (H2SO4), to generate the nitronium ion (NO2+), which acts as the electrophile in this reaction.\n\nHNO3 + H2SO4 → NO2+ + HSO4- + H2O\n\n2. Electrophilic attack: The electrophile, NO2+, attacks the benzene ring, which is rich in electron density due to the presence of delocalized π electrons. This attack results in the formation of a resonance-stabilized carbocation intermediate called the sigma complex or arenium ion.\n\n3. Deprotonation: A base, usually the bisulfate ion (HSO4-) that was formed in the first step, abstracts a proton from the carbocation intermediate. This step restores the aromaticity of the benzene ring and generates nitrobenzene as the final product.\n\nOverall, the reaction can be summarized as:\n\nC6H6 (benzene) + HNO3 (nitric acid) → C6H5NO2 (nitrobenzene) + H2O (water)\n\nKeep in mind that this reaction requires a strong acid catalyst, such as sulfuric acid, to generate the electrophile and facilitate the reaction."
