    "message_2": "To determine the bond order of the O2 molecule using molecular orbital theory, we need to first understand the electron configuration of the oxygen atom. Oxygen has 8 electrons, with the electron configuration 1s² 2s² 2p⁴.\n\nIn molecular orbital theory, atomic orbitals from two oxygen atoms combine to form molecular orbitals. The 2s orbitals combine to form σ2s and σ*2s orbitals, while the 2p orbitals combine to form σ2p, π2p, π*2p, and σ*2p orbitals.\n\nFor the O2 molecule, there are a total of 16 electrons (8 from each oxygen atom). The molecular orbital diagram for O2 is filled in the following order: σ2s, σ*2s, σ2p, π2p, π*2p, and σ*2p.\n\nFilling the molecular orbitals with 16 electrons, we get the following configuration:\n\n- σ2s: 2 electrons\n- σ*2s: 2 electrons\n- σ2p: 2 electrons\n- π2p: 4 electrons (2 electrons in each of the two degenerate π2p orbitals)\n- π*2p: 4 electrons (2 electrons in each of the two degenerate π*2p orbitals)\n- σ*2p: 2 electrons\n\nNow, we can calculate the bond order using the formula:\n\nBond order = (number of electrons in bonding orbitals - number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\n\nBond order = (2 + 2 + 4 - 2 - 4) / 2 = 2\n\nSo, the bond order of the O2 molecule is 2.\n\nTo determine whether the O2 molecule is magnetic or non-magnetic, we need to check for unpaired electrons. In the molecular orbital configuration, there are no unpaired electrons, as all the electrons are paired in the orbitals. Therefore, the O2 molecule is non-magnetic."
