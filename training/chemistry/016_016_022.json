    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use Hess's Law, which states that the total enthalpy change for a reaction is the sum of the enthalpy changes for the individual steps in the reaction. In this case, we can use the enthalpy of formation values given for the reactants and products.\n\nThe reaction is: 2CuO(s) + C(s) → 2Cu(s) + CO2(g)\n\nFirst, we need to find the total enthalpy change for the reactants and products.\n\nFor the reactants:\n2 moles of CuO(s): 2 * (-159.2 kJ/mol) = -318.4 kJ\n1 mole of C(s): Since it is in its standard state, its enthalpy of formation is 0.\n\nFor the products:\n2 moles of Cu(s): Since it is in its standard state, its enthalpy of formation is 0.\n1 mole of CO2(g): -393.5 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nΔH = (Σ enthalpy of products) - (Σ enthalpy of reactants)\nΔH = (-393.5 kJ) - (-318.4 kJ)\nΔH = 75.1 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change for the reaction is 75.1 kJ."
