    "message_2": "The predicted molecular geometry of a water molecule (H2O) is bent or V-shaped. This is due to the presence of two lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen atom, which repel the two hydrogen atoms, causing the H-O-H bond angle to be approximately 104.5 degrees.\n\nWater is a polar molecule because the oxygen atom is more electronegative than the hydrogen atoms, resulting in an uneven distribution of electron density. This creates a partial negative charge on the oxygen atom and partial positive charges on the hydrogen atoms. The bent geometry of the molecule further enhances its polarity, as the dipole moments of the O-H bonds do not cancel each other out, leading to an overall molecular dipole moment."
