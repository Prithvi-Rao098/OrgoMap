    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy change for the formation reaction of methanol (CH3OH), we can use Hess's Law. Hess's Law states that the enthalpy change of a reaction is the same whether it occurs in one step or several steps. We can manipulate the given reactions to form the desired reaction and then add their enthalpy changes.\n\nFirst, we need to manipulate the given reactions to form the desired reaction:\n\n1. C(s) + O2(g) → CO2(g) ∆H = -393.5 kJ/mol\n\n2. 2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(l) ∆H = -571.6 kJ/mol\n\n3. CH3OH(l) + 1.5O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(l)\n\nWe can start by reversing reaction 1:\n\n1. CO2(g) → C(s) + O2(g) ∆H = 393.5 kJ/mol\n\nNext, we need to divide reaction 2 by 2:\n\n2. H2(g) + 0.5O2(g) → H2O(l) ∆H = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can add reactions 1 and 2 to form the desired reaction:\n\n1. CO2(g) → C(s) + O2(g) ∆H = 393.5 kJ/mol\n2. H2(g) + 0.5O2(g) → H2O(l) ∆H = -285.8 kJ/mol\n----------------------------------------------\n3. CH3OH(l) + 1.5O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(l)\n\nNow, we can add the enthalpy changes of reactions 1 and 2 to find the enthalpy change for reaction 3:\n\n∆H3 = ∆H1 + ∆H2\n∆H3 = 393.5 kJ/mol + (-285.8 kJ/mol)\n∆H3 = 107.7 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change for the formation reaction of methanol (CH3OH) is 107.7 kJ/mol."
