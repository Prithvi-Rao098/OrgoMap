    "message_2": "To calculate the bond energy of O2 molecule, we need to use the bond energy values given for O-H and H-H bonds. However, the information provided is not sufficient to directly calculate the bond energy of O2 molecule. \n\nThe bond energies of O-H and H-H are related to the formation of water (H2O) from its elements, but they do not provide a direct relationship to the bond energy of O2 molecule. \n\nIf you have more information, such as the enthalpy of formation of water or the bond energy of another molecule involving oxygen, please provide that information, and I can help you with the calculation."
