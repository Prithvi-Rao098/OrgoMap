    "message_2": "To determine the rate of decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, we need to use the first-order reaction kinetics formula:\n\nrate = k [A]\n\nwhere rate is the rate of the reaction, k is the rate constant, and [A] is the concentration of hydrogen peroxide.\n\nFirst, we need to find the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in moles per liter (M). Given that we have a 6% hydrogen peroxide solution, we can assume that this means 6 g of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in 100 g of solution. \n\n1. Calculate the moles of hydrogen peroxide:\nThe molar mass of H2O2 = 2 * (1.01 g/mol for H) + 2 * (16.00 g/mol for O) = 34.02 g/mol\n6 g of H2O2 = 6 g / 34.02 g/mol = 0.176 moles of H2O2\n\n2. Calculate the volume of the solution in liters:\nAssuming the density of the solution is approximately 1 g/mL (similar to water), we have:\n100 g of solution = 100 mL = 0.1 L\n\n3. Calculate the concentration of hydrogen peroxide:\n0.176 moles of H2O2 / 0.1 L = 1.76 M\n\nNow, we need to find the rate constant (k) using the integrated rate law for first-order reactions:\n\nln([A]0 / [A]) = kt\n\nwhere [A]0 is the initial concentration, [A] is the concentration at time t, and t is the time in seconds.\n\nWe are given that 60 mL of the 6% hydrogen peroxide solution decomposes in 100 seconds. This means that the remaining volume of the solution is 40 mL.\n\n4. Calculate the moles of hydrogen peroxide remaining:\n40 mL / 100 mL = 0.4 (fraction remaining)\n0.176 moles * 0.4 = 0.0704 moles of H2O2 remaining\n\n5. Calculate the concentration of hydrogen peroxide remaining:\n0.0704 moles / 0.1 L = 0.704 M\n\n6. Calculate the rate constant (k):\nln(1.76 M / 0.704 M) = k * 100 s\nk = ln(1.76 / 0.704) / 100 = 0.0101 s^(-1)\n\nFinally, we can calculate the rate of decomposition using the initial concentration of hydrogen peroxide:\n\nrate = k [A] = 0.0101 s^(-1) * 1.76 M = 0.0178 M/s\n\nThe rate of decomposition of hydrogen peroxide is 0.0178 M/s."
