(Hint: You will need to convert picometers to meters and use Coulomb's Law to calculate the potential energy of interaction between the ions.)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the lattice energy of NaCl, we can use the Born-Lande equation:\n\nLattice energy (U) = -A * (1 - 1/n) * (e^2 / 4πε₀r₀)\n\nwhere:\nA = Born-Lande constant = 2.31 x 10^-29 J m\nn = Born exponent (for NaCl, n ≈ 9)\ne = elementary charge = 1.602 x 10^-19 C\nε₀ = vacuum permittivity = 8.854 x 10^-12 C² / (N m²)\nr₀ = distance between ions = 236 pm (converted to meters: 236 x 10^-12 m)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the lattice energy:\n\nU = - (2.31 x 10^-29) * (1 - 1/9) * ( (1.602 x 10^-19)² / (4π * 8.854 x 10^-12 * 236 x 10^-12) )\nU = - (2.31 x 10^-29) * (8/9) * (2.566 x 10^-38 / 6.626 x 10^-23)\nU = - (2.05 x 10^-29) * (3.872 x 10^-16)\nU = -7.94 x 10^-46 J\n\nSince we want the lattice energy in kilojoules per mole, we need to convert joules to kilojoules and multiply by Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23):\n\nU = (-7.94 x 10^-46 J) * (1 kJ / 1000 J) * (6.022 x 10^23 / 1 mol)\nU = -478.8 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the lattice energy of NaCl is approximately -478.8 kJ/mol."
