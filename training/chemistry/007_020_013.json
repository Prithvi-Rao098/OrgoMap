    "message_2": "To formulate a new topical medication that can effectively treat eczema without causing skin irritation, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the active ingredients: Research and identify potential active ingredients that have proven efficacy in treating eczema. These ingredients should have anti-inflammatory, anti-itch, and skin barrier repair properties. Examples of such ingredients include corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and PDE4 inhibitors.\n\n2. Choose a suitable base: Select a suitable base for the topical medication that is gentle on the skin and does not cause irritation. The base should also enhance the penetration of the active ingredients into the skin. Common bases for topical medications include creams, ointments, gels, and lotions. For eczema, an ointment or cream base is often preferred due to their moisturizing properties.\n\n3. Add soothing and moisturizing agents: Incorporate soothing and moisturizing agents into the formulation to help alleviate dryness and itching associated with eczema. Examples of these agents include glycerin, hyaluronic acid, ceramides, and natural oils like jojoba oil or sunflower seed oil.\n\n4. Avoid common irritants: Ensure that the formulation does not contain common skin irritants, such as fragrances, dyes, and harsh preservatives. Instead, opt for hypoallergenic and non-comedogenic ingredients that are less likely to cause irritation or clog pores.\n\n5. Test the formulation: Conduct in vitro and in vivo tests to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and stability of the new topical medication. This may involve testing the formulation on cultured skin cells, animal models, and eventually, human clinical trials.\n\n6. Optimize the formulation: Based on the test results, optimize the formulation by adjusting the concentrations of the active ingredients, base, and other components to achieve the desired therapeutic effect without causing skin irritation.\n\n7. Regulatory approval: Submit the new topical medication for regulatory approval, ensuring that it meets the safety and efficacy requirements of the relevant health authorities.\n\nBy following these steps, we can develop a new topical medication that effectively treats eczema without causing skin irritation."
