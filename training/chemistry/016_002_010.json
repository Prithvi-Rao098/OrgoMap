Here's a precise problem for the student to solve:\n\nUsing Hess's Law, calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of ethylene (C2H4), given the following thermochemical equations with their respective enthalpy changes:\n \nC2H4(g) + 3 O2(g) → 2 CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l)          ∆H = -1411 kJ/mol\n \n2 H2(g) + O2(g) → 2 H2O(l)                                    ∆H = -484 kJ/mol \n   \n2 C(s) + 2 H2(g) + 5/2 O2(g) → C2H4(g)           ∆H = 52 kJ/mol",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Hess's Law, we need to manipulate the given thermochemical equations to obtain the desired equation for the combustion of ethylene (C2H4). The desired equation is:\n\nC2H4(g) + 3 O2(g) → 2 CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l)\n\nFirst, let's reverse the third equation to obtain C2H4(g) on the left side:\n\nC2H4(g) → 2 C(s) + 2 H2(g) + 5/2 O2(g)           ∆H = -52 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we need to manipulate the second equation to obtain 2 H2O(l) on the right side. To do this, we can multiply the entire equation by 2:\n\n4 H2(g) + 2 O2(g) → 4 H2O(l)                                    ∆H = -968 kJ/mol\n\nNext, we need to subtract 2 H2(g) from both sides of the equation:\n\n2 H2(g) + 2 O2(g) → 2 H2O(l)                                    ∆H = -484 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can add the modified second equation and the reversed third equation:\n\nC2H4(g) → 2 C(s) + 2 H2(g) + 5/2 O2(g)           ∆H = -52 kJ/mol\n2 H2(g) + 2 O2(g) → 2 H2O(l)                                    ∆H = -484 kJ/mol\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nC2H4(g) + 3 O2(g) → 2 CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l)          ∆H = ?\n\nFinally, we can add the enthalpy changes of the modified equations to find the enthalpy change for the combustion of ethylene:\n\n∆H = -52 kJ/mol + (-484 kJ/mol) = -536 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the enthalpy change for the combustion of ethylene (C2H4) is -536 kJ/mol."
