    "message_2": "To calculate the yield of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene, we first need to determine the theoretical yield based on the stoichiometry of the reaction and then account for the 95% purity of the final product.\n\n1. Determine the molecular weight of nitrobenzene and 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene.\nNitrobenzene (C6H5NO2): 1(12.01) * 6 + 1(1.01) * 5 + 1(14.01) + 2(16.00) = 123.11 g/mol\n2,4-Dichloronitrobenzene (C6H3Cl2NO2): 1(12.01) * 6 + 1(1.01) * 3 + 2(35.45) + 1(14.01) + 2(16.00) = 191.00 g/mol\n\n2. Calculate the moles of nitrobenzene used in the reaction.\nmoles of nitrobenzene = mass / molecular weight = 10 g / 123.11 g/mol = 0.0812 mol\n\n3. Determine the stoichiometry of the reaction.\nSince chlorine gas is in excess, the reaction is assumed to go to completion. The stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, meaning that 1 mole of nitrobenzene reacts with chlorine gas to produce 1 mole of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene.\n\n4. Calculate the theoretical yield of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene.\nmoles of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene = moles of nitrobenzene = 0.0812 mol\nmass of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene = moles * molecular weight = 0.0812 mol * 191.00 g/mol = 15.49 g\n\n5. Account for the 95% purity of the final product.\nactual yield = theoretical yield * purity = 15.49 g * 0.95 = 14.72 g\n\nThe yield of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene produced from the reaction is 14.72 grams."
