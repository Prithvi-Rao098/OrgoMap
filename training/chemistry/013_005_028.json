    "message_2": "To calculate the surface area of a solid material using nitrogen gas adsorption, we can use the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory. However, since the problem assumes monolayer coverage, we can use the simpler Langmuir isotherm model.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the nitrogen gas adsorption volume from cm³/g to m³/g:\n\n0.52 cm³/g * (1 m³ / 1,000,000 cm³) = 5.2 × 10⁻⁷ m³/g\n\nNext, we need to know the cross-sectional area of a nitrogen molecule. The diameter of a nitrogen molecule is approximately 0.36 nm. Therefore, the cross-sectional area (A_N2) can be calculated as:\n\nA_N2 = π * (diameter / 2)²\nA_N2 = π * (0.36 nm / 2)²\nA_N2 = π * (0.18 nm)²\nA_N2 ≈ 0.1018 nm²\n\nNow, we need to convert the cross-sectional area from nm² to m²:\n\n0.1018 nm² * (1 m² / 1,000,000,000 nm²) = 1.018 × 10⁻¹⁹ m²\n\nFinally, we can calculate the surface area (S) of the solid material using the monolayer coverage:\n\nS = (adsorption volume * Avogadro's number * cross-sectional area of N2) / molecular weight of N2\n\nS = (5.2 × 10⁻⁷ m³/g * 6.022 × 10²³ molecules/mol * 1.018 × 10⁻¹⁹ m²) / 28.02 g/mol\n\nS ≈ 1.13 × 10² m²/g\n\nSo, the surface area of the solid material is approximately 113 m²/g."
