    "message_2": "The Langmuir adsorption isotherm is given by the equation:\n\nθ = (K * C) / (1 + K * C)\n\nwhere θ is the fractional surface coverage, K is the equilibrium constant, and C is the concentration of the adsorbate in solution. In this case, K = 2 x 10^3 M^-1 and C = 5 x 10^-4 M.\n\nFirst, we need to find the fractional surface coverage (θ):\n\nθ = (2 x 10^3 M^-1 * 5 x 10^-4 M) / (1 + 2 x 10^3 M^-1 * 5 x 10^-4 M)\nθ = (1) / (1 + 1)\nθ = 1 / 2\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum adsorption capacity (Γ_max) in moles per square meter. The relationship between fractional surface coverage and maximum adsorption capacity is:\n\nΓ = θ * Γ_max\n\nSince we are looking for Γ_max, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nΓ_max = Γ / θ\n\nHowever, we don't have the value for Γ (adsorption capacity) in the problem. Without this value, we cannot determine the maximum adsorption capacity (Γ_max) in moles per square meter."
