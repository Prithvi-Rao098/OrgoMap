    "message_2": "The standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) of butane (C4H10) at 298 K (25°C) and 1 atm pressure is approximately -126 kJ/mol. This value represents the energy change when 1 mole of butane is formed from its constituent elements (carbon and hydrogen) in their standard states under the given conditions."
