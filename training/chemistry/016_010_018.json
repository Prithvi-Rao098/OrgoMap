    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of solution, we first need to determine the moles of KCl and the heat absorbed by the water.\n\n1. Calculate the moles of KCl:\nKCl has a molar mass of 39.1 g/mol (K) + 35.45 g/mol (Cl) = 74.55 g/mol.\nmoles of KCl = mass / molar mass\nmoles of KCl = 15 g / 74.55 g/mol = 0.2012 mol\n\n2. Calculate the heat absorbed by the water:\nq = mcΔT\nwhere q is the heat absorbed, m is the mass of water, c is the specific heat capacity of water, and ΔT is the temperature change.\nq = (100 g)(4.18 J/g•°C)(-12.5°C) = -5225 J\n\nSince the temperature change is negative, the dissolution of KCl is exothermic, and the heat absorbed by the water is released by the KCl. Therefore, the heat released by KCl is 5225 J.\n\n3. Calculate the enthalpy of solution:\nEnthalpy of solution = heat released by KCl / moles of KCl\nEnthalpy of solution = 5225 J / 0.2012 mol = 25975 J/mol\n\nSince the dissolution is exothermic, the enthalpy of solution is negative:\nEnthalpy of solution = -25.975 kJ/mol"
