    "message_1": "What is the cell potential, in volts, for the electrochemical reaction between a silver electrode and a copper electrode in a solution with 1.0 M silver nitrate and 1.0 M copper nitrate at 25°C? The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nAg(s) + Cu2+(aq) → Ag+ (aq) + Cu(s)\n\nGiven the standard reduction potentials for the half-reactions:\n\nAg+(aq) + e- → Ag(s)    E°red = +0.80 V\nCu2+(aq) + 2e- → Cu(s)    E°red = +0.34 V",
    "message_2": "To calculate the cell potential, we need to determine the standard reduction potential for the overall reaction. Since the given half-reactions are both reduction reactions, we need to reverse one of them to make it an oxidation reaction. In this case, we will reverse the silver half-reaction:\n\nAg(s) → Ag+(aq) + e-    E°ox = -0.80 V\n\nNow, we can combine the two half-reactions:\n\nAg(s) → Ag+(aq) + e-    E°ox = -0.80 V\nCu2+(aq) + 2e- → Cu(s)    E°red = +0.34 V\n\nThe overall reaction is:\n\nAg(s) + Cu2+(aq) → Ag+(aq) + Cu(s)\n\nTo calculate the cell potential, we add the standard oxidation potential and the standard reduction potential:\n\nE°cell = E°ox + E°red = -0.80 V + 0.34 V = -0.46 V\n\nSince the cell potential is negative, the reaction is non-spontaneous under standard conditions. However, the question asks for the cell potential in volts, so the answer is -0.46 V."
