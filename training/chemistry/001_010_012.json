    "message_2": "To calculate the percentage yield, we first need to determine the theoretical yield of the reaction. This can be done by finding the limiting reagent and using stoichiometry.\n\nFirst, we need the molecular weights of the reactants and product:\n\n2-butanone (C4H8O): 72.11 g/mol\n2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (C6H6N4O4): 198.14 g/mol\n2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone (C10H12N4O5): 256.23 g/mol\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nC4H8O + C6H6N4O4 â†’ C10H12N4O5\n\nNow, we can determine the moles of each reactant:\n\nmoles of 2-butanone = 2.50 g / 72.11 g/mol = 0.0346 mol\nmoles of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine = 4.00 g / 198.14 g/mol = 0.0202 mol\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, the limiting reagent is 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine because it has fewer moles.\n\nNow, we can calculate the theoretical yield using the limiting reagent:\n\nmoles of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone = 0.0202 mol (from the limiting reagent)\ntheoretical yield = 0.0202 mol * 256.23 g/mol = 5.17 g\n\nFinally, we can calculate the percentage yield:\n\npercentage yield = (actual yield / theoretical yield) * 100\npercentage yield = (2.00 g / 5.17 g) * 100 = 38.68%\n\nThe percentage yield of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone in this reaction is 38.68%."
