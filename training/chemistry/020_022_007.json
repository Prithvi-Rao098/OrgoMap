    "message_1": "What effect will an increase in the concentration of a reactant have on the equilibrium position of a redox reaction when the reaction quotient is greater than the equilibrium constant?",
    "message_2": "When the reaction quotient (Q) is greater than the equilibrium constant (K), it means that the reaction is currently favoring the reverse reaction (formation of reactants from products). In this situation, if you increase the concentration of a reactant, the system will respond by shifting the equilibrium position to counteract this change, according to Le Chatelier's principle.\n\nAs a result, the equilibrium will shift towards the forward reaction (formation of products from reactants) in an attempt to re-establish equilibrium. This will cause the reaction quotient (Q) to decrease and approach the equilibrium constant (K) value. The overall effect of increasing the concentration of a reactant in this case is that the reaction will proceed more in the forward direction to reach a new equilibrium state."
