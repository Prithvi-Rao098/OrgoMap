Include the balanced equations for each step and state all the necessary conditions for the reaction to occur. Also, calculate the theoretical yield of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid if 10 grams of benzoic acid are reacted with excess chlorine gas.",
    "message_2": "The preparation of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid from benzoic acid and chlorine gas can be achieved through electrophilic aromatic substitution. The reaction mechanism involves two steps:\n\nStep 1: Formation of 2-chlorobenzoic acid\nC6H5COOH + Cl2 → C6H4ClCOOH + HCl\n\nIn this step, benzoic acid (C6H5COOH) reacts with chlorine gas (Cl2) in the presence of a catalyst, such as ferric chloride (FeCl3) or aluminum chloride (AlCl3), to form 2-chlorobenzoic acid (C6H4ClCOOH) and hydrochloric acid (HCl).\n\nStep 2: Formation of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid\nC6H4ClCOOH + Cl2 → C6H3Cl2COOH + HCl\n\nIn the second step, 2-chlorobenzoic acid reacts with chlorine gas in the presence of the same catalyst (FeCl3 or AlCl3) to form 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid (C6H3Cl2COOH) and hydrochloric acid (HCl).\n\nNow, let's calculate the theoretical yield of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid if 10 grams of benzoic acid are reacted with excess chlorine gas.\n\nFirst, determine the molar mass of benzoic acid (C6H5COOH):\nC: 12.01 g/mol x 7 = 84.07 g/mol\nH: 1.01 g/mol x 5 = 5.05 g/mol\nO: 16.00 g/mol x 2 = 32.00 g/mol\nTotal molar mass = 84.07 + 5.05 + 32.00 = 121.12 g/mol\n\nNext, calculate the moles of benzoic acid:\nmoles = mass / molar mass = 10 g / 121.12 g/mol = 0.0826 mol\n\nSince the reaction has a 1:1 stoichiometry, the moles of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid produced will be the same as the moles of benzoic acid reacted.\n\nNow, determine the molar mass of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid (C6H3Cl2COOH):\nC: 12.01 g/mol x 7 = 84.07 g/mol\nH: 1.01 g/mol x 3 = 3.03 g/mol\nCl: 35.45 g/mol x 2 = 70.90 g/mol\nO: 16.00 g/mol x 2 = 32.00 g/mol\nTotal molar mass = 84.07 + 3.03 + 70.90 + 32.00 = 190.00 g/mol\n\nFinally, calculate the theoretical yield of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid:\nmass = moles x molar mass = 0.0826 mol x 190.00 g/mol = 15.69 g\n\nThus, the theoretical yield of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid is 15.69 grams."
