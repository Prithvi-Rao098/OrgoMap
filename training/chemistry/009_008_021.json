    "message_1": "What is the activity of a sample containing 2.0 grams of alpha radioactive material with a half-life of 2.7 days if its initial activity was 200 Bq?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the decay constant (λ) and the number of radioactive nuclei (N) in the sample. Then, we can calculate the current activity (A) using the formula A = λN.\n\n1. Find the decay constant (λ):\nThe decay constant can be found using the formula λ = ln(2) / half-life.\n\nλ = ln(2) / 2.7 days\nλ ≈ 0.257 / day\n\n2. Find the number of radioactive nuclei (N):\nTo find N, we need to know the molar mass of the radioactive material. However, since it is not given, we will assume it is X grams/mol.\n\nMoles of radioactive material = mass / molar mass\nMoles = 2.0 grams / X grams/mol\n\nNow, we need to convert moles to the number of radioactive nuclei using Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23 nuclei/mol).\n\nN = Moles * Avogadro's number\nN = (2.0 / X) * 6.022 x 10^23\n\n3. Calculate the current activity (A):\nA = λN\nA = (0.257 / day) * ((2.0 / X) * 6.022 x 10^23)\n\n4. Find the elapsed time (t) using the initial activity (A₀):\nA₀ = 200 Bq\nA = A₀ * e^(-λt)\n\nt = ln(A / A₀) / -λ\nt ≈ ln((0.257 / day * (2.0 / X) * 6.022 x 10^23) / 200) / -(0.257 / day)\n\n5. Since we don't have the molar mass (X) of the radioactive material, we cannot find the exact value of the current activity (A) or the elapsed time (t). However, if the molar mass is provided, the above formulas can be used to find the current activity and elapsed time."
