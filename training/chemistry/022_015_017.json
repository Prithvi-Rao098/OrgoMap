    "message_2": "To calculate the percent yield, we first need to determine the theoretical yield, which is the maximum amount of product that can be formed from the given amount of reactants.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the synthesis of aspirin is:\n\nC7H6O3 (salicylic acid) + C4H6O3 (acetic anhydride) → C9H8O4 (aspirin) + C2H4O2 (acetic acid)\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of salicylic acid reacts with 1 mole of acetic anhydride to produce 1 mole of aspirin.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the moles of salicylic acid used in the experiment:\n\nMoles of salicylic acid = mass / molar mass\nThe molar mass of salicylic acid (C7H6O3) = (7 × 12.01) + (6 × 1.01) + (3 × 16.00) = 138.12 g/mol\n\nMoles of salicylic acid = 5 g / 138.12 g/mol = 0.0362 mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the theoretical yield of aspirin:\n\nMoles of aspirin = moles of salicylic acid (since they react in a 1:1 ratio) = 0.0362 mol\n\nThe molar mass of aspirin (C9H8O4) = (9 × 12.01) + (8 × 1.01) + (4 × 16.00) = 180.16 g/mol\n\nTheoretical yield of aspirin = moles of aspirin × molar mass of aspirin = 0.0362 mol × 180.16 g/mol = 6.52 g\n\nNow we can calculate the percent yield:\n\nPercent yield = (actual yield / theoretical yield) × 100\nPercent yield = (4.2 g / 6.52 g) × 100 = 64.4%\n\nThe percent yield of this experiment is 64.4%."
