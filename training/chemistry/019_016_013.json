    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the vaporization of 10 grams of water, we need to first determine the number of moles of water and then use the molar heat of vaporization to find the enthalpy change.\n\n1. Calculate the number of moles of water:\nThe molar mass of water (H₂O) is approximately 18.015 g/mol (1.008 g/mol for hydrogen and 15.999 g/mol for oxygen).\n\nNumber of moles = mass / molar mass\nNumber of moles = 10 g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ 0.555 moles\n\n2. Calculate the standard enthalpy change (∆H°) using the molar heat of vaporization:\n∆H° = number of moles × molar heat of vaporization\n∆H° = 0.555 moles × 40.7 kJ/mol ≈ 22.59 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the vaporization of 10 grams of water at 100°C is approximately 22.59 kJ."
