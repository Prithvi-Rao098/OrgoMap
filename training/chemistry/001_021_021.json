    "message_2": "When 1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane is treated with sodium ethoxide in ethanol at a temperature of 60°C, an E2 elimination reaction occurs. The major product formed in this reaction is 1-methylcyclohexene. The ethoxide ion acts as a strong base, removing a β-hydrogen from the 1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, leading to the formation of a double bond and the release of a bromide ion."
