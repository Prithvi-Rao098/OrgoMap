    "message_2": "To find the rate constant (k) for the reaction, we need to use the half-life formula for a second-order reaction. The given reaction is:\n\n2NOBr(g) -> 2NO(g) + Br2(g)\n\nSince the stoichiometric coefficient of NOBr is 2, this is a second-order reaction with respect to NOBr. The half-life formula for a second-order reaction is:\n\nt1/2 = 1 / (k * [A]0)\n\nwhere t1/2 is the half-life, k is the rate constant, and [A]0 is the initial concentration of the reactant (NOBr in this case).\n\nWe are given the half-life (t1/2 = 230 seconds) and the initial concentration of NOBr ([A]0 = 0.0045 M). We can now solve for the rate constant (k):\n\n230 s = 1 / (k * 0.0045 M)\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for k:\n\nk = 1 / (230 s * 0.0045 M)\n\nk ≈ 0.000962 M^(-1)s^(-1)\n\nSo, the rate constant (k) for the reaction at 450°C is approximately 0.000962 M^(-1)s^(-1)."
