    "message_2": "The standard enthalpy change for the fusion of solid silver (Ag) at its melting point (961.78°C) to liquid silver (Ag) at the same temperature is given by the standard enthalpy of fusion. In this case, the standard enthalpy of fusion of solid silver is provided as 11.3 kJ/mol. \n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the fusion of solid silver to liquid silver at 961.78°C is 11.3 kJ/mol."
