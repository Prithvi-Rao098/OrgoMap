    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat released when 10.0 g of methane gas is burned in excess oxygen, we need to use the enthalpy of combustion and the molar mass of methane.\n\nFirst, let's find the moles of methane:\n\nMolar mass of methane (CH4) = 12.01 g/mol (for carbon) + (4 × 1.01 g/mol) (for hydrogen) = 12.01 + 4.04 = 16.05 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the moles of methane in the 10.0 g sample:\n\nmoles of CH4 = mass / molar mass = 10.0 g / 16.05 g/mol = 0.623 moles\n\nNow, we can use the enthalpy of combustion to find the amount of heat released:\n\nΔH = moles × enthalpy of combustion\n\nΔH = 0.623 moles × -890.3 kJ/mol = -554.7 kJ\n\nThe amount of heat released when 10.0 g of methane gas is burned in excess oxygen is 554.7 kJ."
