    "message_1": "A chemistry student needs to determine the effect of increasing the temperature on the equilibrium constant of the formation of a complex ion. Given the equation: \n\nFe3+ + 4OH- ↔ Fe(OH)4-     Kc = 2.1 x 10^-18  \n\nIf the initial concentration of Fe3+ is 0.02 M and OH- is 0.1 M at 25°C, what is the new equilibrium constant at 35°C assuming the reaction is exothermic and the heat of reaction is -20 kJ/mol?",
    "message_2": "To determine the new equilibrium constant at 35°C, we can use the Van't Hoff equation:\n\nln(K2/K1) = -ΔH°/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere K1 is the initial equilibrium constant (2.1 x 10^-18), K2 is the new equilibrium constant, ΔH° is the heat of reaction (-20 kJ/mol), R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T1 is the initial temperature (25°C = 298.15 K), and T2 is the final temperature (35°C = 308.15 K).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the heat of reaction to J/mol:\n\nΔH° = -20 kJ/mol * (1000 J/1 kJ) = -20,000 J/mol\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Van't Hoff equation:\n\nln(K2/(2.1 x 10^-18)) = -(-20,000 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K) * (1/308.15 K - 1/298.15 K)\n\nSolving for K2:\n\nln(K2/(2.1 x 10^-18)) ≈ 0.961\nK2/(2.1 x 10^-18) ≈ e^0.961 ≈ 2.615\n\nK2 ≈ 2.615 * (2.1 x 10^-18) ≈ 5.49 x 10^-18\n\nSo, the new equilibrium constant at 35°C is approximately 5.49 x 10^-18."
