    "message_2": "To determine the optimum amount of chlorine gas required for the preparation of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene from 10 grams of nitrobenzene, we need to perform stoichiometric calculations based on the balanced chemical equation for the reaction.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the preparation of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene from nitrobenzene is:\n\nC6H5NO2 + 2 Cl2 → C6H3Cl2NO2 + 2 HCl\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the number of moles of nitrobenzene (C6H5NO2) in 10 grams:\n\nMolar mass of nitrobenzene = (6 × 12.01) + (5 × 1.01) + 14.01 + 16.00 = 123.11 g/mol\n\nNumber of moles of nitrobenzene = mass / molar mass = 10 g / 123.11 g/mol = 0.0812 mol\n\nFrom the balanced chemical equation, 1 mole of nitrobenzene reacts with 2 moles of chlorine gas (Cl2). Therefore, the number of moles of chlorine gas required for the reaction is:\n\n0.0812 mol nitrobenzene × (2 mol Cl2 / 1 mol nitrobenzene) = 0.1624 mol Cl2\n\nNow, we need to convert the moles of chlorine gas to grams:\n\nMolar mass of Cl2 = 2 × 35.45 = 70.90 g/mol\n\nMass of Cl2 = number of moles × molar mass = 0.1624 mol × 70.90 g/mol = 11.52 g\n\nSo, the optimum amount of chlorine gas required for the preparation of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene from 10 grams of nitrobenzene, assuming 100% yield and complete reaction under standard conditions, is approximately 11.52 grams."
