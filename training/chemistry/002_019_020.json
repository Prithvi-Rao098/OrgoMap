    "message_2": "To calculate the melting point of sodium chloride (NaCl), we can use the following equation:\n\nMelting point (T) = Enthalpy of fusion (ΔH_fus) / Entropy of fusion (ΔS_fus)\n\nGiven the enthalpy of fusion (ΔH_fus) is 28.9 kJ/mol and the entropy of fusion (ΔS_fus) is 41.3 J/K/mol, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nT = (28.9 kJ/mol) / (41.3 J/K/mol)\n\nFirst, we need to convert kJ/mol to J/mol:\n\n28.9 kJ/mol * (1000 J/1 kJ) = 28900 J/mol\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the equation:\n\nT = (28900 J/mol) / (41.3 J/K/mol)\n\nT ≈ 700 K\n\nTherefore, the melting point of sodium chloride (NaCl) is approximately 700 K."
