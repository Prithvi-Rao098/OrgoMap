    "message_2": "To determine the bond order and bond length of the N-O bond in the NO⁻ ion, we first need to examine its molecular orbital (MO) diagram. The molecular orbital diagram for NO⁻ is similar to that of the NO molecule, but with an additional electron in the π* antibonding orbital due to the extra negative charge.\n\nFor NO, there are 11 valence electrons (5 from nitrogen and 6 from oxygen). In NO⁻, there is an additional electron, making a total of 12 valence electrons. We can distribute these electrons in the molecular orbitals as follows:\n\n1. σ(2s) bonding orbital: 2 electrons\n2. σ(2s) antibonding orbital: 2 electrons\n3. σ(2p) bonding orbital: 2 electrons\n4. π(2p) bonding orbitals: 4 electrons (2 in each degenerate orbital)\n5. π*(2p) antibonding orbitals: 2 electrons (1 in each degenerate orbital)\n\nNow, we can calculate the bond order using the formula:\n\nBond order = (number of electrons in bonding orbitals - number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\n\nBond order = (2 + 2 + 4 - 2) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3\n\nThe bond order of the N-O bond in NO⁻ is 3.\n\nAs for the bond length, it is inversely proportional to the bond order. A higher bond order generally corresponds to a shorter bond length and a stronger bond. However, the exact bond length cannot be determined without experimental data or computational methods. In general, we can say that the bond length of the N-O bond in NO⁻ will be shorter than that of a typical single bond (N-O) and closer to that of a triple bond (N≡O)."
