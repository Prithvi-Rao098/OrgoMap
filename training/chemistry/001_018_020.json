    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log ([A-]/[HA])\n\nwhere pH is the pH of the solution, pKa is the acid dissociation constant, [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base, and [HA] is the concentration of the undissociated acid.\n\nIn this case, we are given the pKa (4.2) and the initial concentration of benzoic acid ([HA] = 0.1 M). Since benzoic acid is a weak acid, only a small amount of it will dissociate into its conjugate base (benzoate ion) and a proton (H+). We can represent this dissociation as follows:\n\nC6H5COOH (benzoic acid) ↔ C6H5COO- (benzoate ion) + H+ (proton)\n\nLet x be the concentration of benzoic acid that dissociates. Then, the concentration of the benzoate ion [A-] will also be x, and the concentration of the undissociated benzoic acid [HA] will be (0.1 - x).\n\nNow we can plug these values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = 4.2 + log (x / (0.1 - x))\n\nTo solve for x, we can first simplify the equation by removing the logarithm. We can do this by taking the antilog (10^x) of both sides of the equation:\n\n10^(pH - 4.2) = x / (0.1 - x)\n\nSince the pH is what we want to find, we can rearrange the equation to isolate the pH:\n\npH = 4.2 + log (x / (0.1 - x))\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the pKa is equal to the pH when the concentrations of the acid and its conjugate base are equal ([A-] = [HA]). In this case, x = 0.1 - x, so 2x = 0.1, and x = 0.05.\n\nPlugging this value back into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, we get:\n\npH = 4.2 + log (0.05 / (0.1 - 0.05))\npH = 4.2 + log (0.05 / 0.05)\npH = 4.2 + log (1)\n\nSince the log (1) = 0, the pH of the solution is:\n\npH = 4.2\n\nSo, the pH of a 0.1 M solution of benzoic acid with a pKa of 4.2 at 25°C is 4.2."
