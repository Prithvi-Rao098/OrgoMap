    "message_2": "In a molecule of carbon dioxide (CO2), the bond between carbon and oxygen is polar. This is because oxygen is more electronegative than carbon, resulting in an unequal sharing of electrons and creating a dipole moment. However, the overall molecule is nonpolar due to its linear shape, which causes the two polar bonds to cancel each other out."
