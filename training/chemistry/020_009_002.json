    "message_2": "To find the value of the equilibrium constant (Kp) for the given reaction, we can use the expression:\n\nKp = [CO2][H2] / [CO][H2O]\n\nwhere the brackets represent the partial pressures of the respective gases at equilibrium.\n\nGiven the partial pressures:\nCO = 0.25 atm\nH2O = 0.45 atm\nCO2 = 0.10 atm\nH2 = 0.20 atm\n\nSubstitute these values into the Kp expression:\n\nKp = (0.10)(0.20) / (0.25)(0.45)\n\nKp = 0.02 / 0.1125\n\nKp ≈ 0.178\n\nThe value of the equilibrium constant (Kp) for the given reaction is approximately 0.178."
