    "message_2": "To calculate the heat of crystallization of sodium acetate trihydrate, we need to determine the amount of heat released during the cooling process and the amount of heat released during the crystallization process.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the heat released during the cooling process:\n\nQ1 = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q1 is the heat released during the cooling process, m is the mass of the solution, c is the heat capacity of the solution, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nThe mass of the solution is the sum of the mass of the salt and the mass of the water. The mass of the water can be calculated using its volume and density (1 g/mL for water at room temperature):\n\nmass of water = volume × density = 200 mL × 1 g/mL = 200 g\n\nmass of solution = mass of salt + mass of water = 50 g + 200 g = 250 g\n\nΔT = T_initial - T_final = 25°C - 10°C = 15°C\n\nNow we can calculate Q1:\n\nQ1 = (250 g)(4.18 J/g°C)(15°C) = 15,675 J\n\nNext, we need to calculate the amount of heat released during the crystallization process. To do this, we need to determine the number of moles of sodium acetate trihydrate in the solution:\n\nMolar mass of NaC2H3O2·3H2O = 22.99 (Na) + 2(12.01) + 3(1.01) + 2(16.00) + 3(18.02) = 136.08 g/mol\n\nmoles of salt = mass of salt / molar mass = 50 g / 136.08 g/mol = 0.367 mol\n\nNow we can calculate the heat released during the crystallization process (Q2) using the enthalpy of fusion:\n\nQ2 = moles of salt × enthalpy of fusion = 0.367 mol × -264 kJ/mol = -96.9 kJ\n\nConvert Q2 to J:\n\nQ2 = -96.9 kJ × 1000 J/kJ = -96,900 J\n\nFinally, we can calculate the heat of crystallization (Q_total) by adding the heat released during the cooling process (Q1) and the heat released during the crystallization process (Q2):\n\nQ_total = Q1 + Q2 = 15,675 J + (-96,900 J) = -81,225 J\n\nThe heat of crystallization of sodium acetate trihydrate in this case is -81,225 J."
