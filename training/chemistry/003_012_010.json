    "message_2": "To determine the diffusion coefficient of methane gas in air at 25°C and 1 atm pressure, we can use the Chapman-Enskog equation:\n\nD = (3.03 × 10^(-4) × T^(3/2)) / (P × (Σ^(1/3)))\n\nWhere:\nD = diffusion coefficient (cm²/s)\nT = temperature (K)\nP = pressure (atm)\nΣ = collision diameter (Å)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin:\n\nT = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\n\nNext, we need to find the collision diameter (Σ) for methane (CH4) and air. The collision diameter is the average of the two molecules' collision diameters. The collision diameter of methane is approximately 3.80 Å, and for air (assuming it is mostly nitrogen, N2), it is approximately 3.68 Å.\n\nΣ = (3.80 + 3.68) / 2 = 3.74 Å\n\nNow we can plug in the values into the Chapman-Enskog equation:\n\nD = (3.03 × 10^(-4) × (298.15)^(3/2)) / (1 × (3.74)^(1/3))\nD ≈ 0.142 cm²/s\n\nSo, the diffusion coefficient of methane gas in air at 25°C and 1 atm pressure is approximately 0.142 cm²/s."
