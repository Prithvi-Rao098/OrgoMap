    "message_2": "Investigating the toxicity of existing drugs and making specific alterations in their chemical structure to reduce toxicity while maintaining therapeutic efficacy involves several steps and techniques. Here's an outline of the process:\n\n1. Identify the toxic effects: The first step is to identify the toxic effects of the drug in question. This can be done through a review of the literature, case reports, clinical trials, and post-marketing surveillance data. Toxic effects can be acute or chronic and may involve various organ systems.\n\n2. Determine the mechanism of toxicity: Understanding the mechanism of toxicity is crucial for designing strategies to reduce it. Mechanisms can include off-target effects, reactive metabolites, immune-mediated reactions, or drug-drug interactions. Various in vitro and in vivo assays, as well as computational modeling, can help elucidate the mechanism of toxicity.\n\n3. Identify the structural features responsible for toxicity: Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies can help identify the specific chemical features of the drug molecule responsible for its toxic effects. Computational methods, such as molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations, can also provide insights into the interactions between the drug and its target or off-target proteins.\n\n4. Design and synthesize new analogs: Based on the SAR studies and computational modeling, new analogs of the drug can be designed with modifications in the chemical structure to reduce toxicity. These modifications can include the addition or removal of functional groups, changes in stereochemistry, or the introduction of bioisosteres.\n\n5. Evaluate the new analogs for efficacy and toxicity: The newly synthesized analogs should be evaluated for their therapeutic efficacy and toxicity using in vitro and in vivo models. This may involve testing the analogs in cell-based assays, animal models of disease, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies.\n\n6. Optimization and further testing: Based on the results of the initial evaluations, further optimization of the chemical structure may be necessary to achieve the desired balance between efficacy and reduced toxicity. This iterative process may involve several rounds of design, synthesis, and testing.\n\n7. Clinical trials: Once a new analog with reduced toxicity and maintained therapeutic efficacy has been identified, it can be advanced to clinical trials. The new drug candidate will undergo a series of clinical trials to evaluate its safety, tolerability, efficacy, and optimal dosing in humans.\n\nIn summary, reducing the toxicity of existing drugs while maintaining their therapeutic efficacy involves a multidisciplinary approach that includes understanding the mechanism of toxicity, identifying the structural features responsible for toxicity, designing and synthesizing new analogs, and evaluating their efficacy and toxicity in preclinical and clinical settings."
