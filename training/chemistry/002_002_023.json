    "message_2": "In the compound NH4NO3, there are two parts: the ammonium ion (NH4+) and the nitrate ion (NO3-). We need to find the oxidation state of nitrogen in each ion separately.\n\n1. In the ammonium ion (NH4+):\n- Hydrogen has an oxidation state of +1.\n- There are 4 hydrogen atoms, so the total oxidation state for hydrogen is +4.\n- The overall charge of the ammonium ion is +1.\n- Let the oxidation state of nitrogen in NH4+ be x.\n- The sum of the oxidation states of all atoms in the ion should equal the overall charge of the ion: x + 4(+1) = +1\n- x + 4 = +1\n- x = -3\nSo, the oxidation state of nitrogen in NH4+ is -3.\n\n2. In the nitrate ion (NO3-):\n- Oxygen has an oxidation state of -2.\n- There are 3 oxygen atoms, so the total oxidation state for oxygen is 3(-2) = -6.\n- The overall charge of the nitrate ion is -1.\n- Let the oxidation state of nitrogen in NO3- be y.\n- The sum of the oxidation states of all atoms in the ion should equal the overall charge of the ion: y + 3(-2) = -1\n- y - 6 = -1\n- y = +5\nSo, the oxidation state of nitrogen in NO3- is +5.\n\nIn conclusion, the oxidation state of nitrogen in the compound NH4NO3 is -3 in the ammonium ion (NH4+) and +5 in the nitrate ion (NO3-)."
