    "message_1": "What is the new value of the ionization constant for a weak acid that has an initial Kₐ of 1.8 x 10⁻⁵ and is subjected to a temperature change from 25°C to 40°C, given that the change in enthalpy for the ionization reaction is -25 kJ/mol?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Van't Hoff equation, which relates the temperature dependence of the equilibrium constant (K) to the standard enthalpy change (ΔH) of the reaction:\n\nln(K₂/K₁) = -ΔH/R * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁)\n\nWhere:\n- K₁ and K₂ are the ionization constants at temperatures T₁ and T₂, respectively\n- ΔH is the standard enthalpy change of the reaction\n- R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\n- T₁ and T₂ are the initial and final temperatures in Kelvin, respectively\n\nFirst, we need to convert the temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin:\nT₁ = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\nT₂ = 40°C + 273.15 = 313.15 K\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Van't Hoff equation:\nln(K₂/(1.8 x 10⁻⁵)) = -(-25,000 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K) * (1/313.15 K - 1/298.15 K)\n\nSolve for K₂:\nln(K₂/(1.8 x 10⁻⁵)) = 25,000 / 8.314 * (0.003196 - 0.003356)\nln(K₂/(1.8 x 10⁻⁵)) ≈ 3.006\n\nNow, we can solve for K₂:\nK₂ = (1.8 x 10⁻⁵) * e^(3.006)\nK₂ ≈ 1.49 x 10⁻²\n\nSo, the new value of the ionization constant for the weak acid at 40°C is approximately 1.49 x 10⁻²."
