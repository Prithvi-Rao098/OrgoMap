    "message_2": "The reaction between sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is an acid-base reaction, also known as a neutralization reaction. The products of this reaction are sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) and water (H2O). The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\n2 NaOH + H2SO4 â†’ Na2SO4 + 2 H2O\n\nIn this reaction, the spectator ions are the sodium (Na+) and sulfate (SO4 2-) ions. These ions do not participate in the reaction and remain unchanged in the solution."
