    "message_2": "To calculate the entropy change (ΔS) of an ideal monatomic gas during an isothermal expansion, we can use the formula:\n\nΔS = n * R * ln(Vf / Vi)\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of the gas, R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), Vf is the final volume, and Vi is the initial volume.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles (n) of the gas. We can use the ideal gas law:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nwhere P is the pressure (1 atm), V is the volume, T is the temperature (300 K), and R is the ideal gas constant (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K when using atm for pressure).\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for n:\n\nn = PV / RT\n\nWe don't have the initial volume (Vi) given, but we can still calculate the entropy change in terms of Vi. The final volume (Vf) is 5 times the initial volume:\n\nVf = 5 * Vi\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the entropy change formula:\n\nΔS = (PV / RT) * R * ln(Vf / Vi)\n\nNotice that R cancels out:\n\nΔS = (PV / T) * ln(Vf / Vi)\n\nNow, plug in the values for P, T, Vf, and Vi:\n\nΔS = (1 atm * 5 * Vi) / 300 K * ln((5 * Vi) / Vi)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nΔS = (5 * Vi) / 300 K * ln(5)\n\nΔS = Vi / 60 K * ln(5)\n\nSince we don't have the initial volume (Vi), we cannot calculate the exact numerical value for the entropy change. However, we have the expression for ΔS in terms of Vi:\n\nΔS = (Vi / 60 K) * ln(5)\n\nThis expression shows that the entropy change depends on the initial volume of the gas and is directly proportional to it."
