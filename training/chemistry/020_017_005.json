    "message_1": "What is the equilibrium constant (K) of the reaction when 2 moles of aqueous ammonia (NH3) react with 1 mole of aqueous copper(II) ions (Cu2+) to form a complex ion (Cu(NH3)42+), and the concentration of copper(II) ions and ammonia at equilibrium are 0.02 M and 0.04 M respectively?",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (K) for the reaction, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nCu²⁺(aq) + 4NH₃(aq) ⇌ Cu(NH₃)₄²⁺(aq)\n\nNext, we need to set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the concentrations of each species at equilibrium. Since we are given the equilibrium concentrations of Cu²⁺ and NH₃, we can use these values to find the equilibrium concentration of Cu(NH₃)₄²⁺.\n\nInitial concentrations:\n[Cu²⁺] = 0\n[NH₃] = 0\n[Cu(NH₃)₄²⁺] = 0\n\nChange in concentrations:\n[Cu²⁺] = +0.02 M\n[NH₃] = +0.04 M\n[Cu(NH₃)₄²⁺] = -0.02 M (since 1 mole of Cu(NH₃)₄²⁺ is formed for every 1 mole of Cu²⁺ reacting)\n\nEquilibrium concentrations:\n[Cu²⁺] = 0.02 M\n[NH₃] = 0.04 M\n[Cu(NH₃)₄²⁺] = 0.02 M\n\nNow we can use the equilibrium concentrations to find the equilibrium constant (K) using the expression:\n\nK = [Cu(NH₃)₄²⁺] / ([Cu²⁺][NH₃]^4)\n\nPlugging in the equilibrium concentrations:\n\nK = (0.02) / (0.02 * (0.04)^4)\n\nK = 0.02 / (0.02 * 0.000000256)\n\nK = 0.02 / 0.0000000512\n\nK = 390625\n\nThe equilibrium constant (K) for the reaction is approximately 390,625."
