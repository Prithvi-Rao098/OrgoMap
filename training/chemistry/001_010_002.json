Provide examples to illustrate your answer.",
    "message_2": "The mechanism by which aldehydes and ketones react with nucleophiles is called nucleophilic addition. In this mechanism, a nucleophile (a species with a lone pair of electrons) attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate. This intermediate then collapses, releasing a leaving group (usually a proton) to form the final product. The general mechanism can be represented as follows:\n\n1. Nucleophilic attack: Nu- + R-C=O → R-C(-Nu)-OH\n2. Collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate: R-C(-Nu)-OH → R-C(-Nu)-O- + H+\n\nThe reactivity of aldehydes and ketones towards nucleophilic attack is influenced by the presence of electron-withdrawing or electron-donating substituents on the carbonyl carbon. Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) increase the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon, making it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack. In contrast, electron-donating groups (EDGs) decrease the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon, making it less susceptible to nucleophilic attack.\n\nExamples:\n\n1. Aldehyde with an electron-withdrawing group: \nConsider the reaction of 2,4-dinitrobenzaldehyde with a nucleophile. The nitro groups are strong electron-withdrawing groups, which increase the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon. As a result, the nucleophile can easily attack the carbonyl carbon, leading to a faster reaction compared to benzaldehyde.\n\n2. Aldehyde with an electron-donating group:\nConsider the reaction of 4-methoxybenzaldehyde with a nucleophile. The methoxy group is an electron-donating group, which decreases the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon. As a result, the nucleophile attacks the carbonyl carbon less readily, leading to a slower reaction compared to benzaldehyde.\n\n3. Ketone with an electron-withdrawing group:\nConsider the reaction of hexafluoroacetone with a nucleophile. The fluorine atoms are strong electron-withdrawing groups, which increase the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon. As a result, the nucleophile can easily attack the carbonyl carbon, leading to a faster reaction compared to acetone.\n\n4. Ketone with an electron-donating group:\nConsider the reaction of acetophenone with a nucleophile. The phenyl group is an electron-donating group, which decreases the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon. As a result, the nucleophile attacks the carbonyl carbon less readily, leading to a slower reaction compared to acetone.\n\nIn summary, the presence of electron-withdrawing or electron-donating substituents on aldehydes and ketones can significantly affect their reactivity towards nucleophilic attack. Electron-withdrawing groups increase the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon, making it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack, while electron-donating groups have the opposite effect."
