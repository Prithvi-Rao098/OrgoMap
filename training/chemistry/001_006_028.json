    "message_2": "The reaction of propyne (CH₃C≡CH) with hydrogen chloride (HCl) is an electrophilic addition reaction. The mechanism involves the following steps:\n\n1. Protonation of the alkyne: The hydrogen atom from HCl acts as an electrophile and attacks the electron-rich triple bond of propyne. The pi electrons from the triple bond form a bond with the hydrogen atom, creating a carbocation intermediate and leaving a chloride ion (Cl⁻) in the solution. The carbocation intermediate has a double bond (C=C) and a positive charge on the carbon atom adjacent to the CH₃ group.\n\n2. Nucleophilic attack by chloride ion: The chloride ion (Cl⁻), which is a nucleophile, attacks the positively charged carbon atom in the carbocation intermediate, forming a bond with it. This results in the formation of the final product.\n\nThe product formed in this reaction is 1-chloro-2-propene (CH₃C(Cl)=CH₂), also known as 1-chloropropene. This product is a haloalkene, which is formed by the addition of HCl across the triple bond of propyne."
