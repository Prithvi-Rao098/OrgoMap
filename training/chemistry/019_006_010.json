    "message_1": "What is the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction between hydrogen gas and iodine gas to form hydrogen iodide, if the concentration of hydrogen is 0.10 M, the concentration of iodine is 0.15 M, and the concentration of hydrogen iodide is 0.20 M at equilibrium? The balanced equation for the reaction is:\n\nH2(g) + I2(g) ⇌ 2HI(g)",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction, we can use the expression for Kc based on the balanced equation:\n\nKc = [HI]^2 / ([H2] * [I2])\n\nWe are given the equilibrium concentrations of each species:\n\n[H2] = 0.10 M\n[I2] = 0.15 M\n[HI] = 0.20 M\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Kc expression:\n\nKc = (0.20)^2 / (0.10 * 0.15)\nKc = 0.04 / 0.015\nKc ≈ 2.67\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction between hydrogen gas and iodine gas to form hydrogen iodide is approximately 2.67."
