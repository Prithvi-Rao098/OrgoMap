    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat absorbed by the ice, we need to consider three steps:\n\n1. Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C\n2. Melting the ice at 0°C\n3. Heating the water from 0°C to 20°C\n\nStep 1: Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C\nQ1 = mass x specific heat capacity of ice x temperature change\nSpecific heat capacity of ice is approximately 2.1 J/g°C.\nQ1 = 25 g x 2.1 J/g°C x (0 - (-10))°C = 25 x 2.1 x 10 = 525 J\n\nStep 2: Melting the ice at 0°C\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of ice:\nMolar mass of water (H2O) = 18.015 g/mol\nmoles = mass / molar mass = 25 g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ 1.387 mol\n\nQ2 = moles x enthalpy of fusion\nQ2 = 1.387 mol x 6.01 kJ/mol = 8.34 kJ = 8340 J (converted to Joules)\n\nStep 3: Heating the water from 0°C to 20°C\nQ3 = mass x specific heat capacity of water x temperature change\nQ3 = 25 g x 4.18 J/g°C x (20 - 0)°C = 25 x 4.18 x 20 = 2090 J\n\nNow, we sum up the heat absorbed in all three steps:\nTotal heat absorbed (Q) = Q1 + Q2 + Q3 = 525 J + 8340 J + 2090 J = 10955 J\n\nSo, the amount of heat absorbed by 25 g of ice at -10°C when it is converted to water at 20°C is 10,955 Joules."
