The following table shows the results of the experiment:\n\n| Temperature (K) | Reaction rate (M/s) |\n|----------------|---------------------|\n| 298            | 2.1 × 10^-3         |\n| 308            | 3.8 × 10^-3         |\n| 318            | 7.5 × 10^-3         |\n| 328            | 1.5 × 10^-2         |\n| 338            | 2.8 × 10^-2         |\n\nDetermine the activation energy (in kJ/mol) of the reaction.",
    "message_2": "To determine the activation energy of the reaction, we can use the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk = Ae^(-Ea / RT)\n\nwhere k is the reaction rate, A is the pre-exponential factor, Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nWe can use the data from the table to create two equations with two unknowns (A and Ea) by choosing two different temperatures and their corresponding reaction rates. Let's choose the data at 298 K and 318 K:\n\nk1 = Ae^(-Ea / RT1)\nk2 = Ae^(-Ea / RT2)\n\nwhere k1 = 2.1 × 10^-3 M/s, T1 = 298 K, k2 = 7.5 × 10^-3 M/s, and T2 = 318 K.\n\nNow, we can divide the first equation by the second equation to eliminate A:\n\n(k1 / k2) = e^(-Ea / RT1) / e^(-Ea / RT2)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n(2.1 × 10^-3) / (7.5 × 10^-3) = e^[(Ea / R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2)]\n\n0.28 = e^[(Ea / 8.314) * (1/298 - 1/318)]\n\nNow, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(0.28) = (Ea / 8.314) * (1/298 - 1/318)\n\n-1.27 = (Ea / 8.314) * (-0.000067)\n\nNow, solve for Ea:\n\nEa = -1.27 / (-0.000067) * 8.314\n\nEa ≈ 156,000 J/mol\n\nConvert the activation energy to kJ/mol:\n\nEa ≈ 156 kJ/mol\n\nThe activation energy of the reaction is approximately 156 kJ/mol."
