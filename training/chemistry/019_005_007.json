    "message_2": "To calculate the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for the reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG = Σ(ΔGf(products)) - Σ(ΔGf(reactants))\n\nFor the products, we have 2 moles of H2O(l) with a ΔGf of -237 kJ/mol. For the reactants, we have 2 moles of H2(g) and 1 mole of O2(g), both with a ΔGf of 0 kJ/mol.\n\nΔG = [2(-237 kJ/mol)] - [2(0 kJ/mol) + 1(0 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔG = -474 kJ\n\nSince 1 kJ = 1000 J, we can convert the change in Gibbs free energy to Joules:\n\nΔG = -474 kJ * 1000 J/kJ\n\nΔG = -474,000 J\n\nThe change in Gibbs free energy for the reaction is -474,000 Joules."
