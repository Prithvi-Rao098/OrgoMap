    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a question for the student to solve:\n\nCalculate the equilibrium constant for the electrochemical cell reaction shown below at 25°C, given that the standard reduction potential for Ni2+/Ni is -0.25V, and for Cu2+/Cu is 0.34V.\n\nNi(s) + Cu2+(aq) → Ni2+(aq) + Cu(s)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant (K) for the given reaction, we first need to find the standard cell potential (E°cell) for the reaction. The standard cell potential can be calculated using the standard reduction potentials of the two half-reactions involved.\n\nThe half-reactions are:\n\n1. Ni2+(aq) + 2e- → Ni(s)  E° = -0.25 V (Reduction of Ni2+)\n2. Cu2+(aq) + 2e- → Cu(s)  E° = 0.34 V (Reduction of Cu2+)\n\nSince the given reaction is:\nNi(s) + Cu2+(aq) → Ni2+(aq) + Cu(s)\n\nWe need to reverse the first half-reaction to obtain the desired reaction:\n\n1. Ni(s) → Ni2+(aq) + 2e-  E° = 0.25 V (Oxidation of Ni)\n\nNow, we can add the two half-reactions to get the overall reaction:\n\nNi(s) + Cu2+(aq) → Ni2+(aq) + Cu(s)\n\nNext, we calculate the standard cell potential (E°cell) by subtracting the standard reduction potential of the oxidation half-reaction from the standard reduction potential of the reduction half-reaction:\n\nE°cell = E°(reduction) - E°(oxidation)\nE°cell = 0.34 V - 0.25 V\nE°cell = 0.09 V\n\nNow, we can use the Nernst equation to find the equilibrium constant (K). At equilibrium, the cell potential (Ecell) is zero. The Nernst equation is:\n\nEcell = E°cell - (RT/nF) * ln(K)\n\nAt equilibrium, Ecell = 0, and we can solve for K:\n\n0 = 0.09 V - (RT/nF) * ln(K)\n\nFor this reaction, n = 2 (since there are 2 electrons transferred in the reaction). The gas constant R = 8.314 J/(mol·K), the temperature T = 25°C = 298.15 K, and the Faraday constant F = 96485 C/mol.\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for K:\n\nln(K) = (nFE°cell) / RT\nln(K) = (2 * 96485 C/mol * 0.09 V) / (8.314 J/(mol·K) * 298.15 K)\n\nln(K) ≈ 38.96\n\nNow, we can find K by taking the exponent of both sides:\n\nK = e^(38.96)\nK ≈ 1.96 × 10^16\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant for the given reaction at 25°C is approximately 1.96 × 10^16."
