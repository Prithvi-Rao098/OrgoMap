    "message_2": "The bond order of a molecule is calculated as the difference between the number of bonding electrons and the number of antibonding electrons, divided by 2. For NO, the bond order is given as 2.5.\n\nNO has 11 valence electrons (5 from nitrogen and 6 from oxygen). When we form NO+ ion, we remove one electron, resulting in 10 valence electrons. For NO- ion, we add one electron, resulting in 12 valence electrons.\n\nTo determine the bond order of NO+ and NO-, we can use the molecular orbital (MO) diagram for NO. The MO diagram for NO is similar to that of N2 and O2, with the following order of molecular orbitals: σ1s, σ*1s, σ2s, σ*2s, π2px=π2py, σ2pz, π*2px=π*2py, and σ*2pz.\n\nFor NO+ (10 valence electrons):\n- 2 electrons in σ1s\n- 2 electrons in σ*1s\n- 2 electrons in σ2s\n- 2 electrons in σ*2s\n- 2 electrons in π2px and π2py (1 electron in each)\n\nBond order of NO+ = (8 bonding electrons - 2 antibonding electrons) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3\n\nFor NO- (12 valence electrons):\n- 2 electrons in σ1s\n- 2 electrons in σ*1s\n- 2 electrons in σ2s\n- 2 electrons in σ*2s\n- 4 electrons in π2px and π2py (2 electrons in each)\n- 1 electron in σ2pz\n\nBond order of NO- = (10 bonding electrons - 3 antibonding electrons) / 2 = 7 / 2 = 3.5\n\nSo, the bond order of NO+ ion is 3, and the bond order of NO- ion is 3.5."
