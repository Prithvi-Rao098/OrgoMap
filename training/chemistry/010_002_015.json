    "message_2": "In CuSO4, the oxidation state of copper (Cu) is +2.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the oxidation states for each element in the compound:\n\n- Copper (Cu): +2\n- Sulfur (S): +6 (as it is in the sulfate ion, SO4²⁻)\n- Oxygen (O): -2 (there are four oxygen atoms, so the total is -8)\n\nThe sum of the oxidation states in the compound must equal the overall charge of the compound, which is neutral in this case. So, +2 (Cu) +6 (S) + (-8) (O) = 0."
