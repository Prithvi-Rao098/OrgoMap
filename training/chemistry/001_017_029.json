    "message_2": "To determine the oxidation state of the carbon atom in ethanol (C2H5OH), we need to assign oxidation states to each atom in the molecule and then focus on the carbon atoms.\n\n1. Hydrogen (H) usually has an oxidation state of +1.\n2. Oxygen (O) usually has an oxidation state of -2.\n\nNow let's break down the ethanol molecule into its components: C2H5OH can be written as CH3-CH2-OH.\n\nFor the CH3 group:\n1. Carbon (C) has an unknown oxidation state, which we will represent as x.\n2. There are three hydrogen atoms, each with an oxidation state of +1, so the total for hydrogen is +3.\n\nThe sum of oxidation states in a neutral molecule is 0. Therefore, for the CH3 group:\nx + 3(+1) = 0\nx + 3 = 0\nx = -3\n\nSo, the oxidation state of the carbon atom in the CH3 group is -3.\n\nFor the CH2-OH group:\n1. Carbon (C) has an unknown oxidation state, which we will represent as y.\n2. There are two hydrogen atoms, each with an oxidation state of +1, so the total for hydrogen is +2.\n3. There is one oxygen atom with an oxidation state of -2.\n4. There is one hydrogen atom bonded to the oxygen with an oxidation state of +1.\n\nThe sum of oxidation states in a neutral molecule is 0. Therefore, for the CH2-OH group:\ny + 2(+1) + (-2) + (+1) = 0\ny + 2 - 2 + 1 = 0\ny + 1 = 0\ny = -1\n\nSo, the oxidation state of the carbon atom in the CH2-OH group is -1.\n\nIn conclusion, there are two carbon atoms in ethanol with different oxidation states: one with an oxidation state of -3 and the other with an oxidation state of -1."
