    "message_2": "The isotope notation for an atom of carbon-14 is written as ¹⁴C or C-14, where 14 is the mass number (sum of protons and neutrons) and C is the chemical symbol for carbon.\n\nCarbon always has 6 protons, as its atomic number is 6. To find the number of neutrons, subtract the atomic number from the mass number: 14 - 6 = 8 neutrons.\n\nIn a neutral atom, the number of electrons is equal to the number of protons. So, carbon-14 has 6 electrons.\n\nIn summary, carbon-14 (¹⁴C) has:\n- 6 protons\n- 8 neutrons\n- 6 electrons"
