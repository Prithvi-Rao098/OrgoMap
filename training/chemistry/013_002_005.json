    "message_2": "To calculate the surface tension of water using the capillary rise method, we can use the Jurin's Law formula:\n\nh = (2 * γ * cosθ) / (ρ * g * r)\n\nwhere:\nh = capillary rise (height of the liquid column) = 3 cm = 0.03 m\nγ = surface tension (what we want to find)\nθ = contact angle between the liquid and the capillary tube (for water, it is approximately 0°, so cosθ = 1)\nρ = density of the liquid (for water at 25°C, it is approximately 997 kg/m³)\ng = acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s²)\nr = radius of the capillary tube (diameter is 0.8 mm, so radius is 0.4 mm = 0.0004 m)\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for γ:\n\nγ = (ρ * g * r * h) / (2 * cosθ)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nγ = (997 kg/m³ * 9.81 m/s² * 0.0004 m * 0.03 m) / (2 * 1)\nγ = (0.117 kg * m/s²) / 2\nγ = 0.0585 kg * m/s²\n\nSo, the surface tension of water at 25°C is approximately 0.0585 N/m (Newtons per meter)."
