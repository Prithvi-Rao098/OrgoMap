    "message_2": "The hydrogen-chlorine (H-Cl) bond is polar. You can determine this by looking at the electronegativity values of the two atoms involved in the bond. Electronegativity is a measure of an atom's ability to attract electrons in a covalent bond.\n\nHydrogen has an electronegativity value of 2.1, while chlorine has an electronegativity value of 3.0. The difference in electronegativity values between the two atoms is 0.9 (3.0 - 2.1). Generally, if the electronegativity difference between two atoms is greater than 0.5, the bond is considered polar.\n\nIn a polar bond, the more electronegative atom (in this case, chlorine) will have a partial negative charge, while the less electronegative atom (hydrogen) will have a partial positive charge. This creates a dipole moment, which is a measure of the bond's polarity."
