    "message_1": "What will happen to the equilibrium position when 0.1 moles of CO2 is added to a 1 L container initially containing 0.2 moles of CO2 and 0.3 moles of H2O at equilibrium? (Assuming the reaction is CO2 + H2O â‡Œ H2CO3)",
    "message_2": "When 0.1 moles of CO2 is added to the 1 L container, the initial concentration of CO2 will increase from 0.2 M to 0.3 M (0.2 moles + 0.1 moles = 0.3 moles, and 0.3 moles/1 L = 0.3 M). The initial concentration of H2O remains the same at 0.3 M. Since the reaction is at equilibrium, the addition of CO2 will disturb the equilibrium, causing the reaction to shift according to Le Chatelier's principle.\n\nLe Chatelier's principle states that when a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in concentration, temperature, or pressure, the system will adjust the position of the equilibrium to counteract the change. In this case, the increase in CO2 concentration will cause the reaction to shift to the right, favoring the formation of H2CO3.\n\nAs the reaction shifts to the right, the concentration of CO2 and H2O will decrease, while the concentration of H2CO3 will increase until a new equilibrium is established. The equilibrium position will shift to the right to accommodate the added CO2 and maintain equilibrium in the system."
