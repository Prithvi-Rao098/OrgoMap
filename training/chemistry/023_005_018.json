    "message_2": "The synthesis of ibuprofen from 2-methylpropylbenzene and carbon dioxide involves several steps. Here is a general outline of the mechanism:\n\n1. Friedel-Crafts Alkylation: The first step is the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of 2-methylpropylbenzene (isobutylbenzene) with propionyl chloride in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, such as aluminum chloride (AlCl3). This reaction forms a ketone, 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanone.\n\n2. Hydrolysis: The ketone is then hydrolyzed in the presence of a strong base, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH), to form a carboxylic acid, 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionic acid.\n\n3. Kolbe-Schmitt Reaction: The carboxylic acid is then reacted with carbon dioxide (CO2) in the presence of a strong base, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH), under high pressure and temperature. This reaction, known as the Kolbe-Schmitt reaction, forms a sodium salt of the carboxylic acid, sodium 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionate.\n\n4. Acidification: Finally, the sodium salt is acidified using a strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl), to form ibuprofen, 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionic acid.\n\nIt is important to note that the synthesis of ibuprofen from 2-methylpropylbenzene and carbon dioxide is not a direct reaction. The process involves multiple steps and intermediate compounds to achieve the final product."
