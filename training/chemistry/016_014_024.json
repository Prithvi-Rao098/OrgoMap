The molar heat capacity of solid carbon dioxide is 37 J/mol K, and its enthalpy of fusion is 9.2 kJ/mol. The molar heat capacity of gaseous carbon dioxide is 29 J/mol K, and its enthalpy of vaporization is 22.8 kJ/mol.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the heat of sublimation, we need to find the heat required to convert solid carbon dioxide into gaseous carbon dioxide. The heat of sublimation is the sum of the heat required for the fusion process (solid to liquid) and the heat required for the vaporization process (liquid to gas).\n\nFirst, let's find the number of moles of carbon dioxide (CO2) in 50 grams:\n\nMolar mass of CO2 = 12.01 g/mol (C) + 2 * 16.00 g/mol (O) = 44.01 g/mol\n\nNumber of moles = mass / molar mass = 50 g / 44.01 g/mol = 1.136 moles\n\nNow, let's calculate the heat required for the fusion process (ΔH_fusion):\n\nq_fusion = moles * enthalpy of fusion = 1.136 moles * 9.2 kJ/mol = 10.45 kJ\n\nSince the temperature remains constant during the sublimation process, we don't need to consider the molar heat capacities of solid and gaseous CO2.\n\nNext, let's calculate the heat required for the vaporization process (ΔH_vaporization):\n\nq_vaporization = moles * enthalpy of vaporization = 1.136 moles * 22.8 kJ/mol = 25.90 kJ\n\nFinally, let's find the total heat of sublimation (q_sublimation):\n\nq_sublimation = q_fusion + q_vaporization = 10.45 kJ + 25.90 kJ = 36.35 kJ\n\nTherefore, the heat of sublimation required to convert 50 grams of solid carbon dioxide into gaseous carbon dioxide at a temperature of -78.5°C is 36.35 kJ."
