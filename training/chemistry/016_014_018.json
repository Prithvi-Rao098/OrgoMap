    "message_2": "To calculate the heat required to sublimate 25 grams of dry ice to gaseous CO2 at 25°C, we need to consider three steps:\n\n1. Heating the solid CO2 from -78.5°C to its sublimation point (0°C)\n2. Sublimating the solid CO2 to gaseous CO2\n3. Heating the gaseous CO2 from 0°C to 25°C\n\nFirst, let's find the number of moles of CO2:\nMolar mass of CO2 = 12.01 (C) + 2 * 16.00 (O) = 44.01 g/mol\nNumber of moles = (mass) / (molar mass) = 25 g / 44.01 g/mol = 0.568 mol\n\nStep 1: Heating the solid CO2 from -78.5°C to 0°C\nq1 = n * Cs * ΔT\nq1 = 0.568 mol * 37.1 J/mol K * (0 - (-78.5))\nq1 = 0.568 mol * 37.1 J/mol K * 78.5 K\nq1 = 1623.3 J\n\nStep 2: Sublimating the solid CO2 to gaseous CO2\nq2 = n * heat of fusion\nq2 = 0.568 mol * 8.6 kJ/mol\nq2 = 4.8848 kJ\nq2 = 4884.8 J (converted to Joules)\n\nStep 3: Heating the gaseous CO2 from 0°C to 25°C\nq3 = n * Cg * ΔT\nq3 = 0.568 mol * 29.1 J/mol K * (25 - 0)\nq3 = 0.568 mol * 29.1 J/mol K * 25 K\nq3 = 413.1 J\n\nNow, let's add the heat required for all three steps:\nTotal heat required (q) = q1 + q2 + q3\nq = 1623.3 J + 4884.8 J + 413.1 J\nq = 6921.2 J\n\nThe heat required to sublimate 25 grams of dry ice at -78.5°C to gaseous CO2 at a temperature of 25°C is 6921.2 Joules."
