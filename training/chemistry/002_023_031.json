    "message_2": "To calculate the electrical conductivity of a 0.1 M KCl solution at 25°C, we need to consider the molar conductivity of KCl and the concentration of the solution.\n\nThe molar conductivity of KCl at 25°C is approximately 149.9 S cm²/mol. We can use the following equation to calculate the electrical conductivity:\n\nElectrical conductivity (κ) = Molar conductivity (Λ) × Concentration (c)\n\nκ = 149.9 S cm²/mol × 0.1 mol/L\n\nκ = 14.99 S/m\n\nSo, the electrical conductivity of a 0.1 M KCl solution at 25°C is approximately 14.99 S/m or 14.99 S/cm."
