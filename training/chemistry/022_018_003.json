    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat required to break all the bonds in 5 moles of carbon dioxide, we need to consider the bond energy values for the C=O bond. The O-H bond is not relevant in this case, as there are no O-H bonds in carbon dioxide.\n\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) has two C=O double bonds. The bond energy for a C=O double bond is approximately 799 kJ/mol.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the energy required to break one mole of CO2:\n\nEnergy = 2 (C=O bonds) × 799 kJ/mol (C=O bond energy) = 1598 kJ/mol\n\nNow, let's calculate the energy required to break 5 moles of CO2:\n\nEnergy = 5 moles × 1598 kJ/mol = 7990 kJ\n\nTherefore, the amount of heat required to break all the bonds in 5 moles of carbon dioxide is 7990 kJ."
