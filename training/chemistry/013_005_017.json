(Assume that the cross-sectional area of a nitrogen molecule is 0.162 nm² and the density of nitrogen gas at 77 K and 1 atm is 0.81 g/L).",
    "message_2": "To calculate the specific surface area of the activated carbon sample, we need to determine the number of nitrogen molecules adsorbed and then use the cross-sectional area of a nitrogen molecule to find the total surface area. Finally, we will divide the total surface area by the mass of the activated carbon sample to get the specific surface area.\n\nFirst, let's find the mass of the nitrogen gas adsorbed:\nVolume of nitrogen gas = 2.5 mL = 0.0025 L\nDensity of nitrogen gas = 0.81 g/L\n\nMass of nitrogen gas = Volume × Density\nMass of nitrogen gas = 0.0025 L × 0.81 g/L = 0.002025 g\n\nNow, let's find the number of moles of nitrogen gas:\nMolar mass of nitrogen gas (N2) = 28 g/mol\n\nMoles of nitrogen gas = Mass / Molar mass\nMoles of nitrogen gas = 0.002025 g / 28 g/mol = 7.23 × 10^(-5) mol\n\nNow, let's find the number of nitrogen molecules:\nAvogadro's number = 6.022 × 10^(23) molecules/mol\n\nNumber of nitrogen molecules = Moles × Avogadro's number\nNumber of nitrogen molecules = 7.23 × 10^(-5) mol × 6.022 × 10^(23) molecules/mol = 4.35 × 10^(19) molecules\n\nNow, let's find the total surface area using the cross-sectional area of a nitrogen molecule:\nCross-sectional area of a nitrogen molecule = 0.162 nm²\n\nTotal surface area = Number of nitrogen molecules × Cross-sectional area of a nitrogen molecule\nTotal surface area = 4.35 × 10^(19) molecules × 0.162 nm²/molecule = 7.05 × 10^(19) nm²\n\nFinally, let's find the specific surface area:\nMass of activated carbon sample = 0.1 g\n\nSpecific surface area = Total surface area / Mass of activated carbon sample\nSpecific surface area = 7.05 × 10^(19) nm² / 0.1 g = 7.05 × 10^(20) nm²/g\n\nThe specific surface area of the activated carbon sample is 7.05 × 10^(20) nm²/g."
