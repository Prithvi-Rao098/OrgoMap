    "message_2": "The coordination compound [Co(NH3)4Cl2]+ exhibits two types of isomerism: geometrical isomerism and optical isomerism.\n\n1. Geometrical Isomerism:\nIn this compound, there are two geometrical isomers possible, which are cis and trans isomers.\n\na) Cis isomer: In the cis isomer, the two chloride (Cl) ligands are adjacent to each other. The structure can be represented as:\n\n       Cl\n        |\nNH3-Co-NH3\n  |     |\n NH3   NH3\n\nb) Trans isomer: In the trans isomer, the two chloride (Cl) ligands are opposite to each other. The structure can be represented as:\n\n       Cl\n        |\nNH3-Co-NH3\n  |     |\n NH3   Cl\n\n2. Optical Isomerism:\nThe cis isomer of [Co(NH3)4Cl2]+ exhibits optical isomerism as it has a non-superimposable mirror image. The two optical isomers are enantiomers, which are a pair of chiral molecules. They can be represented as:\n\nCis-Δ-[Co(NH3)4Cl2]+ and Cis-Λ-[Co(NH3)4Cl2]+\n\nHowever, the trans isomer does not exhibit optical isomerism as it has a plane of symmetry, making it an achiral molecule.\n\nIn summary, the coordination compound [Co(NH3)4Cl2]+ has two geometrical isomers (cis and trans) and the cis isomer further exhibits optical isomerism with two enantiomers (Δ and Λ)."
