    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for dissolving potassium chloride in water, we need to know the enthalpy of dissolution for KCl. The enthalpy of dissolution is the amount of heat absorbed or released when a substance dissolves in a solvent at constant pressure. For potassium chloride, the enthalpy of dissolution is +17.22 kJ/mol.\n\nFirst, let's determine the number of moles of KCl in 10 grams:\n\nmoles of KCl = mass / molar mass\nmoles of KCl = 10 g / 74.5513 g/mol\nmoles of KCl = 0.134 mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change for dissolving 0.134 mol of KCl:\n\nΔH = moles × enthalpy of dissolution\nΔH = 0.134 mol × 17.22 kJ/mol\nΔH = 2.31 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change for dissolving 10 grams of potassium chloride in 200 mL of water at 25°C is approximately +2.31 kJ. Since the enthalpy change is positive, the dissolution process is endothermic, meaning it absorbs heat from the surroundings."
