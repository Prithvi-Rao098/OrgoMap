    "message_2": "The standard electrode potential of a half-cell reaction is the same as its standard reduction potential when the reaction is written as a reduction (gain of electrons). In this case, the half-cell reaction is already written as a reduction:\n\nAg+ + e- → Ag\n\nSince the standard reduction potential of Ag+ is given as 0.80 V, the standard electrode potential of this half-cell reaction is also 0.80 V."
