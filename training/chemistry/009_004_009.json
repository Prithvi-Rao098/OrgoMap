    "message_2": "The minimum temperature required for two deuterium nuclei to undergo nuclear fusion is approximately 15 million Kelvin (15 x 10^6 K). This high temperature is necessary to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged deuterium nuclei.\n\nThe resulting product of this reaction is a helium-3 nucleus and a neutron. The equation for this reaction is:\n\nD + D â†’ He-3 + n\n\nwhere D represents a deuterium nucleus, He-3 represents a helium-3 nucleus, and n represents a neutron."
