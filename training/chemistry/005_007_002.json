    "message_2": "The order of nucleotides in DNA determines the sequence of amino acids in a protein through a two-step process: transcription and translation. These processes involve the conversion of the DNA sequence into an RNA sequence (transcription) and then into an amino acid sequence (translation).\n\n1. Transcription: During transcription, the DNA sequence is used as a template to create a complementary RNA molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA). This process is carried out by an enzyme called RNA polymerase, which binds to a specific region on the DNA called the promoter. The RNA polymerase unwinds the DNA double helix and reads the DNA sequence in the 3' to 5' direction. As it reads the DNA, it synthesizes a complementary mRNA strand in the 5' to 3' direction. The mRNA is created using the base pairing rules, with adenine (A) pairing with uracil (U) and cytosine (C) pairing with guanine (G). Once the transcription is complete, the mRNA molecule is released from the DNA template and moves to the cytoplasm for translation.\n\n2. Translation: Translation is the process of converting the mRNA sequence into an amino acid sequence to form a protein. This process occurs in the cytoplasm on ribosomes, which are the protein synthesis machinery of the cell. The mRNA sequence is read in groups of three nucleotides called codons. Each codon corresponds to a specific amino acid or a stop signal. For example, the codon AUG codes for the amino acid methionine and also serves as the start codon, while UAA, UAG, and UGA are stop codons.\n\nTransfer RNA (tRNA) molecules play a crucial role in translation. Each tRNA molecule has an anticodon region that is complementary to a specific mRNA codon and carries the corresponding amino acid. As the ribosome moves along the mRNA, it reads the codons, and the appropriate tRNA molecules with matching anticodons bind to the mRNA. The amino acids carried by the tRNAs are then joined together by peptide bonds to form a growing polypeptide chain. This process continues until a stop codon is encountered, signaling the end of translation. The completed polypeptide chain is then released from the ribosome and undergoes further processing and folding to form a functional protein.\n\nIn summary, the order of nucleotides in DNA determines the sequence of amino acids in a protein by first being transcribed into a complementary mRNA sequence, which is then translated into an amino acid sequence with the help of tRNA molecules and ribosomes. The specific order of codons in the mRNA dictates the order of amino acids in the resulting protein, ultimately determining its structure and function."
