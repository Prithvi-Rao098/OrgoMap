    "message_1": "A student attempted to synthesize 20 grams of a compound, but only ended up with 15 grams of the compound after the reaction. Calculate the percentage yield of the reaction.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the percentage yield of the reaction, we can use the following formula:\n\nPercentage yield = (Actual yield / Theoretical yield) x 100\n\nIn this case, the actual yield is 15 grams, and the theoretical yield is 20 grams.\n\nPercentage yield = (15 / 20) x 100 = 0.75 x 100 = 75%\n\nThe percentage yield of the reaction is 75%."
