    "message_2": "The molecular geometry of XeF4 (xenon hexafluoride) is square planar. In this structure, the central xenon (Xe) atom is surrounded by four fluorine (F) atoms in a planar arrangement, with bond angles of 90 degrees between them.\n\nAs for the polarity of XeF4, it is a nonpolar molecule. Although the Xe-F bonds are polar due to the difference in electronegativity between xenon and fluorine atoms, the overall molecular geometry causes these bond dipoles to cancel each other out, resulting in a net dipole moment of zero. This makes the XeF4 molecule nonpolar."
