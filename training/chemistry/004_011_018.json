    "message_2": "To determine the structure of an unknown compound X using 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra, I would need the actual data from the spectra, including chemical shifts, splitting patterns, and integration values for the 1H-NMR, as well as chemical shifts for the 13C-NMR. \n\nOnce the data is provided, I can help you interpret the spectra and deduce the structure of the compound."
