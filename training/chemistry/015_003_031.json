    "message_2": "To determine the vibrational frequencies and corresponding infrared spectra of 1,3-butadiene, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw the structure of 1,3-butadiene and determine its point group symmetry.\n2. Perform quantum chemistry calculations using appropriate software.\n3. Analyze the vibrational frequencies and infrared spectra.\n4. Relate the vibrational modes to the molecular structure and symmetry.\n\nStep 1: Structure and point group symmetry\n1,3-butadiene has the molecular formula C4H6 and its structure consists of four carbon atoms in a chain with alternating single and double bonds, and two hydrogen atoms attached to each terminal carbon atom. The point group symmetry of 1,3-butadiene is D2h.\n\nStep 2: Quantum chemistry calculations\nTo perform quantum chemistry calculations, you can use software like Gaussian, ORCA, or GAMESS. You will need to choose an appropriate level of theory (e.g., DFT with B3LYP functional and 6-31G(d) basis set) and perform a geometry optimization followed by a frequency calculation.\n\nStep 3: Analyze vibrational frequencies and infrared spectra\nOnce the calculations are complete, you will obtain a list of vibrational frequencies (in cm-1) and their corresponding infrared intensities. The vibrational frequencies correspond to the different vibrational modes of the molecule, and the infrared intensities indicate how strongly each mode absorbs infrared radiation.\n\nStep 4: Relate vibrational modes to molecular structure and symmetry\nAnalyze the vibrational modes in terms of their symmetry and bond type. For example, you may find that some modes correspond to C-H stretching, C-C stretching, or C=C stretching vibrations. Additionally, some modes may be symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to the molecular plane.\n\nIn summary, to determine the vibrational frequencies and corresponding infrared spectra of 1,3-butadiene, you need to perform quantum chemistry calculations using appropriate software and analyze the results in terms of molecular structure and symmetry."
