    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction, we can use the formula:\n\nKc = [products]^coefficients / [reactants]^coefficients\n\nFor the reaction N2(g) + O2(g) ⇌ 2NO(g), the coefficients are as follows:\n\nN2: 1\nO2: 1\nNO: 2\n\nNow, we can plug in the given equilibrium concentrations:\n\nKc = ([NO]^2) / ([N2] * [O2])\nKc = (0.50^2) / (0.10 * 0.10)\nKc = 0.25 / 0.01\nKc = 25\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction at 25°C is 25."
