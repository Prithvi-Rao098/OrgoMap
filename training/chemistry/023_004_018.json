    "message_2": "To determine the yield of acetylsalicylic acid, we first need to identify the limiting reactant. We can do this by calculating the moles of each reactant and comparing their mole ratios.\n\nThe molecular weight of salicylic acid (C7H6O3) is 138.12 g/mol, and the molecular weight of acetic anhydride (C4H6O3) is 102.09 g/mol.\n\nFirst, let's find the moles of each reactant:\n\nMoles of salicylic acid = mass / molecular weight\n= 2.00 g / 138.12 g/mol\n= 0.0145 mol\n\nThe density of acetic anhydride is 1.08 g/mL, so the mass of 4.00 mL of acetic anhydride is:\n\nMass of acetic anhydride = volume × density\n= 4.00 mL × 1.08 g/mL\n= 4.32 g\n\nNow, let's find the moles of acetic anhydride:\n\nMoles of acetic anhydride = mass / molecular weight\n= 4.32 g / 102.09 g/mol\n= 0.0423 mol\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction between salicylic acid and acetic anhydride is:\n\nC7H6O3 + C4H6O3 → C9H8O4 + C2H4O2\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that the mole ratio of salicylic acid to acetic anhydride is 1:1. Now, let's compare the mole ratios of the reactants:\n\nMole ratio = moles of salicylic acid / moles of acetic anhydride\n= 0.0145 mol / 0.0423 mol\n= 0.343\n\nSince the mole ratio is less than 1, salicylic acid is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow, we can calculate the actual yield of acetylsalicylic acid based on the limiting reactant and the given theoretical yield:\n\nActual yield = (moles of limiting reactant / moles of limiting reactant in theoretical yield) × theoretical yield\n= (0.0145 mol / (2.32 g / 180.16 g/mol)) × 2.32 g\n= (0.0145 mol / 0.0129 mol) × 2.32 g\n= 1.12 g\n\nSo, the yield of acetylsalicylic acid obtained from the reaction is 1.12 g."
