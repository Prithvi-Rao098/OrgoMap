    "message_2": "In solid sodium chloride (NaCl), the type of bonding that exists between sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl) is ionic bonding. This occurs when the sodium atom loses one electron to become a positively charged ion (Na+), and the chlorine atom gains one electron to become a negatively charged ion (Cl-). The electrostatic attraction between these oppositely charged ions forms the ionic bond in the sodium chloride crystal lattice."
