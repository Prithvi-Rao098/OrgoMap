    "message_2": "To balance the half-reaction for the oxidation of ethanol (C2H5OH) to acetic acid (CH3COOH), we need to balance the atoms and charges in the reaction.\n\n1. Write the unbalanced half-reaction:\nC2H5OH → CH3COOH\n\n2. Balance the carbon atoms:\nC2H5OH → 2 CH3COOH\n\n3. Balance the hydrogen atoms by adding H2O:\nC2H5OH → 2 CH3COOH + H2O\n\n4. Balance the oxygen atoms by adding H+ ions:\nC2H5OH + H2O → 2 CH3COOH + 4 H+\n\n5. Balance the charges by adding electrons (e-):\nC2H5OH + H2O + 2 e- → 2 CH3COOH + 4 H+\n\nThe balanced half-reaction is:\nC2H5OH + H2O + 2 e- → 2 CH3COOH + 4 H+\n\nNow, let's determine the oxidation state change of carbon in this reaction. \n\nIn ethanol (C2H5OH), the carbon atom in the CH3 group has an oxidation state of -3, while the carbon atom in the CH2OH group has an oxidation state of -1.\n\nIn acetic acid (CH3COOH), the carbon atom in the CH3 group has an oxidation state of -3, while the carbon atom in the COOH group has an oxidation state of +3.\n\nThe oxidation state change of carbon in this reaction is from -1 to +3, which is an increase of 4."
