    "message_2": "To determine the purity of a given sample of aspirin using its melting point, you will need to compare the melting point of the sample with the known melting point of pure aspirin. The melting point of pure aspirin is approximately 138-140°C.\n\nHere are the steps to determine the purity of the aspirin sample:\n\n1. Measure the melting point of the aspirin sample using a melting point apparatus. To do this, place a small amount of the sample in a capillary tube and insert it into the apparatus. Heat the sample and observe the temperature at which it begins to melt and the temperature at which it completely melts.\n\n2. Compare the melting point range of the sample with the known melting point range of pure aspirin (138-140°C).\n\n3. If the melting point range of the sample is close to or within the known range of pure aspirin, the sample is likely to be of high purity. If the melting point range is significantly lower than the known range, the sample is likely to be impure.\n\n4. To quantify the purity, you can use the following formula:\n\nPurity (%) = [(Melting point of sample - Melting point of impure aspirin) / (Melting point of pure aspirin - Melting point of impure aspirin)] x 100\n\nNote that this formula assumes that the impurities present in the sample have a known melting point and that the relationship between melting point and purity is linear.\n\nKeep in mind that the melting point determination method is a qualitative method and may not provide an exact percentage of purity. For a more accurate determination of purity, other methods such as chromatography or spectroscopy should be used."
