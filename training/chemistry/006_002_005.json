    "message_2": "To determine the rate coefficient and activation energy for the free-radical polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) at 60 °C, we need to refer to experimental data or literature values. \n\nAccording to the literature, the activation energy (Ea) for the initiation step of MMA free-radical polymerization is approximately 30 kcal/mol (125.5 kJ/mol). The rate coefficient (k) for the initiation step can be determined using the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk = A * exp(-Ea / RT)\n\nwhere:\n- k is the rate coefficient\n- A is the pre-exponential factor (frequency factor)\n- Ea is the activation energy\n- R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\n- T is the temperature in Kelvin (60 °C = 333.15 K)\n\nUnfortunately, the pre-exponential factor (A) is not provided. However, if you have access to the pre-exponential factor or experimental data, you can use the Arrhenius equation to calculate the rate coefficient at 60 °C."
