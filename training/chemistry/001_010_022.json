    "message_2": "When propanal (an aldehyde) is reacted with Tollen's reagent (ammoniacal silver nitrate, [Ag(NH3)2]NO3), the product formed is silver mirror (silver metal, Ag) and the corresponding carboxylic acid, in this case, propanoic acid.\n\nThe mechanism of the reaction involves the following steps:\n\n1. Nucleophilic attack: The Tollen's reagent contains the complex ion [Ag(NH3)2]+, which acts as a weak oxidizing agent. The oxygen atom of the carbonyl group in propanal has a partial negative charge, while the carbon atom has a partial positive charge. The electron-rich [Ag(NH3)2]+ ion attacks the partially positive carbonyl carbon, forming a tetrahedral intermediate.\n\n2. Proton transfer: A water molecule deprotonates the ammonium ion (NH4+) formed in the previous step, generating ammonia (NH3). The ammonia molecule then protonates the tetrahedral intermediate, leading to the formation of a hemiacetal intermediate.\n\n3. Elimination of silver: The hemiacetal intermediate collapses, releasing a silver atom (Ag) and forming a new carbonyl group. The silver atoms deposit on the surface of the reaction vessel, forming a silver mirror.\n\n4. Hydration: The carbonyl group in the newly formed aldehyde is attacked by a water molecule, forming a gem-diol intermediate.\n\n5. Tautomerization: The gem-diol intermediate undergoes keto-enol tautomerization, resulting in the formation of the carboxylic acid, propanoic acid.\n\nOverall, the reaction is an oxidation process, where propanal is oxidized to propanoic acid, and the silver ion in Tollen's reagent is reduced to metallic silver."
