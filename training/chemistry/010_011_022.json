    "message_1": "What is the efficiency of an electrochemical cell in which a current of 1.5 A is passed for 2 hours between two electrodes, given that the potential difference between the electrodes is 1.5 V and the total energy consumed is 5400 Joules?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the efficiency of the electrochemical cell, we first need to determine the electrical work done by the cell and then compare it to the total energy consumed.\n\n1. Calculate the electrical work done (W) using the formula: W = V * I * t, where V is the potential difference, I is the current, and t is the time.\n\nV = 1.5 V\nI = 1.5 A\nt = 2 hours = 2 * 3600 seconds = 7200 seconds\n\nW = 1.5 V * 1.5 A * 7200 s = 16200 Joules\n\n2. Calculate the efficiency (η) using the formula: η = (Electrical work done / Total energy consumed) * 100\n\nη = (16200 J / 5400 J) * 100\n\nη = 3 * 100 = 300%\n\nHowever, the efficiency cannot be greater than 100%. This indicates that there might be an error in the given data or the calculation. Please double-check the provided information."
