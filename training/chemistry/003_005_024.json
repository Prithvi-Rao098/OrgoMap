    "message_2": "To estimate the bond length of a carbon-carbon triple bond, we can use the concept of bond order. Bond order is the number of chemical bonds between a pair of atoms. In a carbon-carbon double bond, the bond order is 2, and in a carbon-carbon triple bond, the bond order is 3.\n\nThe bond length decreases as the bond order increases because more electrons are shared between the two atoms, leading to a stronger attraction and shorter distance between the nuclei.\n\nThe carbon-carbon single bond length is approximately 1.54 Å. Using this information, we can estimate the bond length of a carbon-carbon triple bond by comparing the bond lengths of single and double bonds.\n\nThe difference in bond length between a single bond (1.54 Å) and a double bond (1.33 Å) is 0.21 Å. Assuming a similar decrease in bond length for the triple bond, we can subtract this difference from the double bond length:\n\n1.33 Å (double bond length) - 0.21 Å (difference) ≈ 1.12 Å\n\nTherefore, the approximate bond length of a carbon-carbon triple bond in a molecule with a linear geometry is around 1.12 Å."
