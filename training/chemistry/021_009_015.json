    "message_1": "What is the bond order of the nitrogen molecule (N2) and how is it determined through molecular orbital theory?",
    "message_2": "In molecular orbital theory, the bond order is determined by the difference between the number of electrons in bonding and antibonding orbitals, divided by 2. For a nitrogen molecule (N2), each nitrogen atom has 7 electrons, so there are a total of 14 electrons in the molecule.\n\nTo determine the bond order, we need to fill the molecular orbitals with these 14 electrons. The molecular orbitals for N2, in increasing energy levels, are:\n\n1. σ1s (bonding)\n2. σ*1s (antibonding)\n3. σ2s (bonding)\n4. σ*2s (antibonding)\n5. π2p (bonding)\n6. π*2p (antibonding)\n7. σ2p (bonding)\n\nNow, we fill the orbitals with the 14 electrons:\n\n1. σ1s: 2 electrons\n2. σ*1s: 2 electrons\n3. σ2s: 2 electrons\n4. σ*2s: 2 electrons\n5. π2p: 4 electrons (2 in each degenerate orbital)\n6. π*2p: 0 electrons\n7. σ2p: 2 electrons\n\nNow, we calculate the bond order:\n\nBond order = (Number of electrons in bonding orbitals - Number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\n\nBond order = (2 + 2 + 4 + 2 - 2 - 2) / 2\n\nBond order = (10 - 4) / 2\n\nBond order = 6 / 2\n\nBond order = 3\n\nSo, the bond order of the nitrogen molecule (N2) is 3, which indicates a triple bond between the two nitrogen atoms."
