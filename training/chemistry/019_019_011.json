    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of methane gas at standard conditions, we need to use the standard enthalpies of formation for each compound involved in the reaction.\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) is the change in enthalpy during the formation of 1 mole of a substance from its constituent elements in their standard states at 25°C and 1 atm pressure.\n\nThe standard enthalpies of formation for the compounds involved in the reaction are as follows:\n\nΔHf° (CH4) = -74.8 kJ/mol\nΔHf° (O2) = 0 kJ/mol (since it's an element in its standard state)\nΔHf° (CO2) = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔHf° (H2O) = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nWe can calculate the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the reaction using the following equation:\n\nΔH° = Σ [ΔHf° (products)] - Σ [ΔHf° (reactants)]\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\nΔH° = [1 × (-393.5) + 2 × (-285.8)] - [1 × (-74.8) + 2 × (0)]\n\nΔH° = (-393.5 - 571.6) - (-74.8)\n\nΔH° = -965.1 + 74.8\n\nΔH° = -890.3 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of methane gas at standard conditions is -890.3 kJ/mol."
