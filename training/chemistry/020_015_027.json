    "message_2": "To determine the change in pH of a 0.1 M acetic acid solution when 0.01 M HCl is added to it, we need to consider the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the initial pH of the acetic acid solution.\n2. Determine the amount of HCl added to the solution.\n3. Calculate the new concentration of acetic acid and its conjugate base (acetate) after the addition of HCl.\n4. Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to calculate the new pH of the solution.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the initial pH of the acetic acid solution\nAcetic acid (CH3COOH) is a weak acid with a Ka value of 1.8 x 10^(-5). We can use the Ka expression to find the initial concentration of H+ ions in the solution:\n\nKa = [H+][CH3COO-]/[CH3COOH]\n\nAssuming x is the concentration of H+ ions and CH3COO- ions, we can write the equation as:\n\n1.8 x 10^(-5) = x^2/(0.1-x)\n\nSince x is very small compared to 0.1, we can approximate the equation as:\n\n1.8 x 10^(-5) ≈ x^2/0.1\n\nSolving for x (concentration of H+ ions):\n\nx ≈ √(1.8 x 10^(-5) * 0.1) ≈ 1.34 x 10^(-3) M\n\nNow we can calculate the initial pH of the acetic acid solution:\n\npH = -log[H+] ≈ -log(1.34 x 10^(-3)) ≈ 2.87\n\nStep 2: Determine the amount of HCl added to the solution\nLet's assume we have 1 L of the 0.1 M acetic acid solution. When we add 0.01 M HCl, the moles of HCl added can be calculated as:\n\nmoles of HCl = volume (L) * concentration (M)\nAssuming we add 10 mL (0.01 L) of 0.01 M HCl:\n\nmoles of HCl = 0.01 L * 0.01 M = 1 x 10^(-4) moles\n\nStep 3: Calculate the new concentration of acetic acid and its conjugate base after the addition of HCl\nWhen HCl is added to the acetic acid solution, it reacts with the acetic acid to form its conjugate base (acetate) and water:\n\nCH3COOH + HCl → CH3COO- + H2O\n\nSince 1 x 10^(-4) moles of HCl are added, the new concentrations of acetic acid and acetate can be calculated as:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.1 M - 1 x 10^(-4) moles = 0.0999 M\n[CH3COO-] = 1 x 10^(-4) moles\n\nStep 4: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to calculate the new pH of the solution\nThe Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is given by:\n\npH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n\nFor acetic acid, pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.8 x 10^(-5)) ≈ 4.74\n\nNow we can plug in the new concentrations of acetic acid and acetate:\n\npH = 4.74 + log([CH3COO-]/[CH3COOH]) = 4.74 + log(1 x 10^(-4)/0.0999) ≈ 2.88\n\nSo, the pH of the 0.1 M acetic acid solution after adding 0.01 M HCl increases slightly from 2.87 to 2.88."
