    "message_2": "The addition of a catalyst to a redox reaction, such as the one between sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3) and potassium iodate (KIO3), does not affect the equilibrium position of the reaction when temperature and pressure are held constant. \n\nA catalyst works by lowering the activation energy of a reaction, which allows the reaction to proceed at a faster rate. However, it is important to note that a catalyst affects both the forward and reverse reactions equally, meaning that it speeds up both reactions without changing the equilibrium constant (K) or the equilibrium position.\n\nIn summary, the addition of a catalyst to the redox reaction between sodium thiosulfate and potassium iodate will increase the rate at which the reaction reaches equilibrium, but it will not change the actual equilibrium position of the reaction when temperature and pressure are held constant."
