    "message_1": "What is the equilibrium constant expression for the following reaction: \n\n2NO (g) + O2 (g) â‡Œ 2NO2 (g) \n\nAt a certain temperature, the equilibrium concentrations are [NO] = 0.10 M, [O2] = 0.050 M, and [NO2] = 0.40 M. Calculate the equilibrium constant for this reaction at this temperature.",
    "message_2": "The equilibrium constant expression for the given reaction is:\n\nKc = [NO2]^2 / ([NO]^2 * [O2])\n\nGiven the equilibrium concentrations: [NO] = 0.10 M, [O2] = 0.050 M, and [NO2] = 0.40 M, we can substitute these values into the expression:\n\nKc = (0.40)^2 / ((0.10)^2 * (0.050))\n\nKc = 0.16 / (0.01 * 0.050)\n\nKc = 0.16 / 0.0005\n\nKc = 320\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium constant for this reaction at this temperature is 320."
