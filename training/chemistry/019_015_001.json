    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for this process, we need to consider three steps:\n\n1. Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C\n2. Melting the ice at 0°C\n3. Heating the liquid water from 0°C to 40°C\n\nStep 1: Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C\nq1 = mass x specific heat capacity of ice x temperature change\nq1 = 5 g x 2.03 J g^-1 K^-1 x (0 - (-10)) K\nq1 = 5 g x 2.03 J g^-1 K^-1 x 10 K\nq1 = 101.5 J\n\nStep 2: Melting the ice at 0°C\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of ice:\nMolar mass of water (H2O) = 18.015 g/mol\nmoles = mass / molar mass\nmoles = 5 g / 18.015 g/mol\nmoles = 0.2775 mol\n\nNow we can calculate the enthalpy change for melting the ice:\nq2 = moles x molar enthalpy of fusion\nq2 = 0.2775 mol x 6.01 kJ mol^-1\nq2 = 1.667 kJ\nSince we need the answer in Joules, we'll convert kJ to J:\nq2 = 1.667 kJ x 1000 J kJ^-1\nq2 = 1667 J\n\nStep 3: Heating the liquid water from 0°C to 40°C\nq3 = mass x specific heat capacity of water x temperature change\nq3 = 5 g x 4.18 J g^-1 K^-1 x (40 - 0) K\nq3 = 5 g x 4.18 J g^-1 K^-1 x 40 K\nq3 = 836 J\n\nNow we can find the total enthalpy change for the entire process by adding the enthalpy changes for each step:\nTotal enthalpy change = q1 + q2 + q3\nTotal enthalpy change = 101.5 J + 1667 J + 836 J\nTotal enthalpy change = 2604.5 J\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for fusion of 5 g of ice at -10°C to liquid water at 40°C is 2604.5 J."
