    "message_2": "Zinc chloride (ZnCl2) is a white crystalline solid in its pure form. When dissolved in water, it forms a colorless solution. The color of ZnCl2 in both solid state and aqueous solution is mainly due to the absence of any electronic transitions within the visible light range that would cause absorption of light and, consequently, the appearance of color.\n\nFactors that could potentially influence the color of ZnCl2 include impurities and the presence of other ions or complexes. For example, if there are trace amounts of other metal ions or complexes present in the solid or solution, they could potentially cause a color change. However, in its pure form, ZnCl2 remains a white solid and forms a colorless solution when dissolved in water."
