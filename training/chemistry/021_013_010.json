    "message_2": "The Lewis structure of the hydrogen peroxide molecule (H2O2) can be represented as follows:\n\nO - H\n  |\nH - O\n\nIn this structure, each oxygen atom is bonded to one hydrogen atom and has two lone pairs of electrons. The oxygen atoms are also connected by a single bond, which represents two shared electrons."
