    "message_2": "To calculate the formal charge on the oxygen atom in the sulfate ion (SO4 2-), we will use the formula:\n\nFormal charge = (Valence electrons of the atom) - (Non-bonding electrons) - (1/2 × Bonding electrons)\n\nIn the sulfate ion, there are four oxygen atoms bonded to a central sulfur atom. Each oxygen atom forms a double bond with the sulfur atom. The Lewis structure of the sulfate ion can be represented as:\n\nO=S=O\n||  ||\nO=S=O\n\nNow, let's calculate the formal charge on one of the oxygen atoms:\n\n1. Valence electrons of oxygen: Oxygen belongs to Group 16 (or Group 6A) in the periodic table, so it has 6 valence electrons.\n\n2. Non-bonding electrons: In the sulfate ion, each oxygen atom has 4 non-bonding electrons (2 lone pairs).\n\n3. Bonding electrons: Each oxygen atom forms a double bond with the sulfur atom, which means there are 4 bonding electrons (2 per bond).\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nFormal charge = (6) - (4) - (1/2 × 4)\nFormal charge = 6 - 4 - 2\nFormal charge = 0\n\nThe formal charge on each oxygen atom in the sulfate ion (SO4 2-) is 0."
