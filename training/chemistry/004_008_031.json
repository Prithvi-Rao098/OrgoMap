    "message_1": "What functional groups are present in an unknown organic compound X, and can they be identified using infrared spectroscopy?",
    "message_2": "Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is a powerful technique for identifying functional groups in organic compounds. However, without knowing the specific structure or formula of the unknown compound X, it is impossible to list the exact functional groups present. \n\nNevertheless, I can provide you with a general overview of common functional groups that can be identified using IR spectroscopy and their characteristic absorption bands:\n\n1. Alcohols and Phenols: O-H stretching around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹ (broad peak)\n2. Carboxylic Acids: O-H stretching around 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ (broad peak) and C=O stretching around 1700-1720 cm⁻¹\n3. Amines: N-H stretching around 3300-3500 cm⁻¹ (sharp peak)\n4. Alkenes: C=C stretching around 1620-1680 cm⁻¹\n5. Alkynes: C≡C stretching around 2100-2260 cm⁻¹\n6. Carbonyl groups (C=O): \n   a. Aldehydes: 1720-1740 cm⁻¹\n   b. Ketones: 1705-1725 cm⁻¹\n   c. Esters: 1735-1750 cm⁻¹\n   d. Amides: 1630-1690 cm⁻¹\n7. Nitriles: C≡N stretching around 2210-2260 cm⁻¹\n\nTo identify the functional groups present in compound X, you would need to obtain its IR spectrum and analyze the absorption bands. Comparing the observed peaks with the characteristic absorption bands listed above will help you determine the functional groups present in the compound."
