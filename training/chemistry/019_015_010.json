    "message_1": "What is the standard enthalpy change of fusion for water? Show your calculation using the given data: the molar enthalpy of fusion of ice is 6.01 kJ/mol and the molar enthalpy of vaporization of water is 40.67 kJ/mol.",
    "message_2": "The standard enthalpy change of fusion for water is the amount of energy required to convert one mole of ice to one mole of liquid water at constant pressure and temperature. In this case, the given data already provides the molar enthalpy of fusion of ice, which is the value we are looking for.\n\nThe molar enthalpy of fusion of ice is 6.01 kJ/mol.\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change of fusion for water is 6.01 kJ/mol."
