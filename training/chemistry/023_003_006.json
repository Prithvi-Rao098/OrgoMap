    "message_2": "To achieve the maximum yield in the synthesis of nylon-6,6 from adipic acid and hexamethylenediamine, you should use stoichiometric amounts of both reactants. This means that the molar ratio of adipic acid to hexamethylenediamine should be 1:1.\n\nTo calculate the optimum amount of hexamethylenediamine, you need to know the amount of adipic acid being used. Once you have that information, you can use the molecular weights of both compounds to determine the required amount of hexamethylenediamine.\n\nMolecular weight of adipic acid (C6H10O4) = 146.14 g/mol\nMolecular weight of hexamethylenediamine (C6H16N2) = 116.21 g/mol\n\nIf you have 'x' grams of adipic acid, you can calculate the moles of adipic acid as follows:\n\nmoles of adipic acid = x / 146.14\n\nSince the molar ratio is 1:1, the moles of hexamethylenediamine required will be the same as the moles of adipic acid. To find the optimum amount of hexamethylenediamine in grams, use the following equation:\n\noptimum amount of hexamethylenediamine (grams) = moles of hexamethylenediamine * 116.21"
