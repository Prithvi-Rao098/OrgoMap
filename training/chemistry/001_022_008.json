    "message_2": "The reaction described is a 1,2-alkyl shift, which occurs via a carbocation intermediate. Here's the stepwise mechanism for the rearrangement of 3-methyl-1-pentene to give 2-methyl-2-butene as the major product:\n\nStep 1: Protonation of the alkene\nA strong acid (e.g., H2SO4 or H3PO4) protonates the double bond of 3-methyl-1-pentene, generating a carbocation intermediate. The protonation occurs at the less substituted carbon of the double bond, resulting in a secondary carbocation.\n\n3-methyl-1-pentene + H+ → 3-methyl-2-pentyl carbocation\n\nStep 2: 1,2-alkyl shift\nA 1,2-alkyl shift (hydride shift) occurs, in which a hydrogen atom from the adjacent carbon (3-methyl group) migrates to the carbocation center. This rearrangement results in a more stable tertiary carbocation.\n\n3-methyl-2-pentyl carbocation → 2-methyl-2-pentyl carbocation\n\nStep 3: Deprotonation\nThe tertiary carbocation loses a proton to a base (e.g., the conjugate base of the acid used in step 1), forming the double bond and yielding the final product, 2-methyl-2-butene.\n\n2-methyl-2-pentyl carbocation + B- → 2-methyl-2-butene + HB\n\nThe selectivity towards the formation of 2-methyl-2-butene as the major product can be explained by the stability of the carbocation intermediates. The 1,2-alkyl shift occurs to form a more stable tertiary carbocation from the initially formed secondary carbocation. Tertiary carbocations are more stable than secondary carbocations due to hyperconjugation and the inductive effect of the additional alkyl groups. As a result, the reaction favors the formation of the more stable carbocation intermediate, which then leads to the major product, 2-methyl-2-butene."
