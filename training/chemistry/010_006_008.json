    "message_1": "What is the concentration of Cu2+ ions in a solution when a current of 2.5 A is passed through a copper(II) sulphate solution using an electrode for 160 seconds? The copper electrode used in the process had a mass of 14.5 g and the electrode potential was + 0.34 V. The formula mass of CuSO4 is 159.6 g/mol, and the Faraday constant is 96,485 coulombs per mole.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to determine the amount of charge passed through the solution. We can do this by multiplying the current (2.5 A) by the time (160 seconds):\n\nQ = I × t\nQ = 2.5 A × 160 s\nQ = 400 coulombs\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of moles of Cu2+ ions that were reduced at the electrode. The reduction of Cu2+ ions requires 2 moles of electrons per mole of Cu2+ ions, as shown in the balanced half-reaction:\n\nCu2+ + 2e- → Cu\n\nNow, we can use the Faraday constant (96,485 coulombs per mole) to determine the number of moles of Cu2+ ions reduced:\n\nmoles of Cu2+ = (Q × moles of Cu2+) / (2 × Faraday constant)\nmoles of Cu2+ = (400 coulombs × moles of Cu2+) / (2 × 96,485 coulombs/mol)\n\nSolving for moles of Cu2+:\n\nmoles of Cu2+ = 400 coulombs / (2 × 96,485 coulombs/mol)\nmoles of Cu2+ = 0.002073 mol\n\nNow, we need to determine the concentration of Cu2+ ions in the solution. To do this, we need to know the volume of the solution. Unfortunately, the volume of the solution is not provided in the problem. However, if the volume of the solution is known, the concentration of Cu2+ ions can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nconcentration of Cu2+ = moles of Cu2+ / volume of solution (in liters)\n\nWithout the volume of the solution, we cannot determine the exact concentration of Cu2+ ions."
