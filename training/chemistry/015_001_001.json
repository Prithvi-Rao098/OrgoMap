    "message_2": "The ground state electronic configuration of the oxygen molecule (O2) using Molecular Orbital Theory can be determined by filling the molecular orbitals with the available electrons. Oxygen has 8 electrons, so O2 has a total of 16 electrons.\n\nThe order of molecular orbitals in O2 is as follows:\n1. σ1s\n2. σ*1s\n3. σ2s\n4. σ*2s\n5. σ2pz\n6. π2px = π2py\n7. π*2px = π*2py\n8. σ*2pz\n\nNow, we fill the molecular orbitals with the 16 electrons:\n1. σ1s: 2 electrons\n2. σ*1s: 2 electrons\n3. σ2s: 2 electrons\n4. σ*2s: 2 electrons\n5. σ2pz: 2 electrons\n6. π2px = π2py: 4 electrons (2 in each)\n7. π*2px = π*2py: 2 electrons (1 in each)\n8. σ*2pz: 0 electrons\n\nSo, the ground state electronic configuration of O2 is:\n(σ1s)^2(σ*1s)^2(σ2s)^2(σ*2s)^2(σ2pz)^2(π2px)^2(π2py)^2(π*2px)^1(π*2py)^1\n\nTo calculate the bond order, we use the formula:\nBond order = (number of electrons in bonding orbitals - number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\n\nIn O2, there are 10 electrons in bonding orbitals (σ1s, σ2s, σ2pz, π2px, and π2py) and 6 electrons in antibonding orbitals (σ*1s, σ*2s, π*2px, and π*2py).\n\nBond order = (10 - 6) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2\n\nTherefore, the bond order of the oxygen molecule (O2) is 2."
