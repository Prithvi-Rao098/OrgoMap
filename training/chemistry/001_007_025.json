    "message_2": "The molecular formula of benzene is C6H6. Benzene is an aromatic hydrocarbon that consists of a six-membered ring with alternating single and double bonds.\n\nThe difference between the resonance structures of benzene lies in the arrangement of the double bonds. In benzene, there are two possible resonance structures, which are essentially mirror images of each other. In one resonance structure, the double bonds are between carbon atoms 1-2, 3-4, and 5-6, while in the other resonance structure, the double bonds are between carbon atoms 2-3, 4-5, and 6-1. These two resonance structures are in equilibrium, and the actual structure of benzene is a hybrid of these two forms. The electrons in the double bonds are delocalized, which means they are spread out over the entire ring, giving benzene its characteristic stability and aromaticity."
