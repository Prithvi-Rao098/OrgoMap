    "message_2": "The effect of temperature on the adsorption of nitrogen gas on a solid surface can be explained using adsorption isotherms, such as the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. Generally, as temperature increases, the adsorption of nitrogen gas on a solid surface decreases. This is because adsorption is an exothermic process, and higher temperatures provide more energy for the nitrogen molecules to overcome the attractive forces between them and the solid surface.\n\nExperimental evidence to support this can be found in a study conducted by Kiselev and Lygin (1969), where they investigated the adsorption of nitrogen on graphite at various temperatures. They measured the amount of nitrogen adsorbed on the graphite surface at different temperatures and pressures, and then plotted the data using adsorption isotherms.\n\nThe results showed that as the temperature increased, the amount of nitrogen adsorbed on the graphite surface decreased. This trend was consistent across all the temperatures and pressures tested in the study. The decrease in adsorption with increasing temperature can be attributed to the weakening of the attractive forces between the nitrogen molecules and the solid surface, as well as the increased kinetic energy of the nitrogen molecules, which makes it more difficult for them to be adsorbed.\n\nIn conclusion, the effect of temperature on the adsorption of nitrogen gas on a solid surface is that adsorption decreases with increasing temperature. This observation is supported by experimental evidence from studies such as the one conducted by Kiselev and Lygin, which demonstrated this trend using adsorption isotherms and measurements of nitrogen adsorption on graphite at various temperatures and pressures."
