    "message_2": "To calculate the specific heat capacity of water, we can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat energy (in joules), m is the mass of the substance (in grams), c is the specific heat capacity (in J/g°C), and ΔT is the change in temperature (in °C).\n\nWe are given the following information:\n\n- Mass of water (m) = 25 g\n- Initial temperature (T1) = 25°C\n- Final temperature (T2) = 40°C\n- Heat energy (q) = 200 J\n\nFirst, we need to find the change in temperature (ΔT):\n\nΔT = T2 - T1 = 40°C - 25°C = 15°C\n\nNow, we can rearrange the formula to solve for the specific heat capacity (c):\n\nc = q / (mΔT)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nc = 200 J / (25 g × 15°C) = 200 J / 375 g°C = 0.533 J/g°C\n\nTherefore, the specific heat capacity of water in this case is approximately 0.533 J/g°C. Note that the generally accepted value for the specific heat capacity of water is 4.18 J/g°C, so this calculated value is likely affected by experimental error or other factors not accounted for in the problem."
