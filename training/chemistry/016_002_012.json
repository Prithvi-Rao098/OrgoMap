C(graphite) + 2H2(g) --> CH4(g)     ΔH°f = ?\n2. C(graphite) + O2(g) --> CO2(g)     ΔH° = -393.5 kJ/mol\n3. H2(g) + 1/2O2(g) --> H2O(l)      ΔH° = -286.0 kJ/mol",
    "message_2": "To find the heat of formation of methane (ΔH°f), we can use Hess's Law, which states that the total enthalpy change for a reaction is the sum of the enthalpy changes for each step in the reaction. We can use the given reactions to create a pathway to the combustion of methane:\n\n1. CH4(g) + 2O2(g) --> CO2(g) + 2H2O(l)     ΔH° = -890.4 kJ/mol (combustion of methane)\n\nWe can manipulate the given reactions to match the products and reactants of the combustion reaction:\n\n2. C(graphite) + O2(g) --> CO2(g)     ΔH° = -393.5 kJ/mol (no change needed)\n\n3. 2(H2(g) + 1/2O2(g) --> H2O(l))      ΔH° = 2(-286.0 kJ/mol) = -572.0 kJ/mol (multiply by 2 to get 2 moles of H2O)\n\nNow, we can add reactions 2 and 3 to get the combustion reaction:\n\n4. C(graphite) + 2H2(g) + 2O2(g) --> CO2(g) + 2H2O(l)     ΔH° = -393.5 kJ/mol + (-572.0 kJ/mol) = -965.5 kJ/mol\n\nAccording to Hess's Law, the enthalpy change for the combustion reaction (ΔH° = -890.4 kJ/mol) should be equal to the enthalpy change for the sum of reactions 2 and 3 (ΔH° = -965.5 kJ/mol). However, there is a discrepancy due to the unknown heat of formation of methane (ΔH°f). We can solve for ΔH°f using the following equation:\n\n-890.4 kJ/mol = -965.5 kJ/mol + ΔH°f\n\nΔH°f = -890.4 kJ/mol + 965.5 kJ/mol = 75.1 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the heat of formation of methane (CH4) is 75.1 kJ/mol."
