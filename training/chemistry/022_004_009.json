    "message_2": "To balance the redox equation for the reaction between iron(II) chloride (FeCl2) and potassium permanganate (KMnO4) in acidic solution, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Write down the unbalanced equation:\nFeCl2 + KMnO4 → FeCl3 + MnCl2 + KCl\n\n2. Separate the redox reaction into half-reactions:\nOxidation half-reaction: Fe²⁺ → Fe³⁺ + e⁻\nReduction half-reaction: MnO₄⁻ + 8H⁺ + 5e⁻ → Mn²⁺ + 4H₂O\n\n3. Balance the half-reactions:\nOxidation half-reaction: Fe²⁺ → Fe³⁺ + e⁻ (already balanced)\nReduction half-reaction: MnO₄⁻ + 8H⁺ + 5e⁻ → Mn²⁺ + 4H₂O (already balanced)\n\n4. Equalize the number of electrons in both half-reactions:\nTo do this, multiply the oxidation half-reaction by 5 and the reduction half-reaction by 1, so that both half-reactions have 5 electrons.\n\n5Fe²⁺ → 5Fe³⁺ + 5e⁻\nMnO₄⁻ + 8H⁺ + 5e⁻ → Mn²⁺ + 4H₂O\n\n5. Add the half-reactions and cancel out the electrons:\n5Fe²⁺ + MnO₄⁻ + 8H⁺ → 5Fe³⁺ + Mn²⁺ + 4H₂O\n\n6. Balance the charges by adding appropriate spectator ions:\n5FeCl2 + KMnO4 + 8HCl → 5FeCl3 + MnCl2 + 4H₂O + KCl\n\n7. Check if the equation is balanced in terms of atoms and charges:\n5Fe²⁺ + MnO₄⁻ + 8H⁺ + 5Cl₂ → 5Fe³⁺ + Mn²⁺ + 4H₂O + 5Cl₂ + K⁺\n\nThe balanced redox equation for the reaction between iron(II) chloride and potassium permanganate in acidic solution is:\n\n5FeCl2 + KMnO4 + 8HCl → 5FeCl3 + MnCl2 + 4H₂O + KCl"
