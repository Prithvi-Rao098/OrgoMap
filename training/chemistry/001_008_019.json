Analyze the reaction mechanism and explain why primary alcohols can be easily oxidized while tertiary alcohols cannot be oxidized at all. Also, give examples of primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols to illustrate their reactivity towards oxidation.",
    "message_2": "Primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols differ in their structure and reactivity towards oxidation with potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7). The classification of these alcohols is based on the number of alkyl groups attached to the carbon atom that bears the hydroxyl group (-OH).\n\nPrimary alcohols (1°) have one alkyl group attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group, secondary alcohols (2°) have two alkyl groups, and tertiary alcohols (3°) have three alkyl groups attached to the carbon with the hydroxyl group.\n\nExamples:\n- Primary alcohol: Ethanol (CH3CH2OH)\n- Secondary alcohol: Isopropanol (CH3CHOHCH3)\n- Tertiary alcohol: tert-Butanol (C(CH3)3OH)\n\nReactivity towards oxidation with potassium dichromate:\n\nPrimary alcohols can be easily oxidized to aldehydes and further to carboxylic acids. Secondary alcohols can be oxidized to ketones, while tertiary alcohols cannot be oxidized at all under normal conditions.\n\nReaction mechanism:\n\n1. Primary alcohols:\nThe oxidation of primary alcohols involves the removal of two hydrogen atoms: one from the hydroxyl group and one from the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the hydroxyl group). The reaction proceeds through the formation of an aldehyde intermediate, which can be further oxidized to a carboxylic acid. The ease of oxidation is due to the presence of only one alkyl group, which offers less steric hindrance and allows the oxidizing agent to approach the hydroxyl group more easily.\n\n2. Secondary alcohols:\nIn the case of secondary alcohols, the oxidation involves the removal of two hydrogen atoms: one from the hydroxyl group and one from the alpha-carbon. However, since there are two alkyl groups attached to the alpha-carbon, the reaction proceeds only up to the ketone stage and cannot be further oxidized to a carboxylic acid. The presence of two alkyl groups provides some steric hindrance, making the reaction slower than the oxidation of primary alcohols.\n\n3. Tertiary alcohols:\nTertiary alcohols cannot be oxidized under normal conditions because there is no hydrogen atom attached to the alpha-carbon for the oxidizing agent to remove. The presence of three alkyl groups around the hydroxyl-bearing carbon creates significant steric hindrance, preventing the oxidizing agent from approaching the hydroxyl group.\n\nIn summary, the reactivity of alcohols towards oxidation with potassium dichromate decreases in the order: primary > secondary > tertiary. This trend is due to the increasing steric hindrance and the decreasing availability of hydrogen atoms on the alpha-carbon as we move from primary to tertiary alcohols."
