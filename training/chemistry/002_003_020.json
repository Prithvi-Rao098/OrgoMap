    "message_2": "To determine the solubility of calcium sulfate (CaSO4) in water at 25°C, we can use the solubility product constant (Ksp) expression. The dissociation of CaSO4 in water can be represented as:\n\nCaSO4 (s) ⇌ Ca²⁺ (aq) + SO₄²⁻ (aq)\n\nThe Ksp expression for this reaction is:\n\nKsp = [Ca²⁺][SO₄²⁻]\n\nLet the solubility of CaSO4 be represented by 's' mol/L. When CaSO4 dissolves, it produces 's' mol/L of Ca²⁺ ions and 's' mol/L of SO₄²⁻ ions. Therefore, we can substitute these concentrations into the Ksp expression:\n\nKsp = (s)(s) = s²\n\nNow, we can solve for 's' using the given Ksp value:\n\n4.93 × 10⁻⁵ = s²\n\nTo find 's', take the square root of both sides:\n\ns = √(4.93 × 10⁻⁵)\ns ≈ 7.02 × 10⁻³ mol/L\n\nSo, the solubility of calcium sulfate (CaSO4) in water at 25°C is approximately 7.02 × 10⁻³ mol/L."
