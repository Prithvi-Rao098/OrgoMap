    "message_2": "The synthesis of ibuprofen from 2-methylpropylbenzene (isobutylbenzene) and carbon dioxide involves several steps. Here is a step-by-step mechanism for this process:\n\n1. Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:\n- In the first step, 2-methylpropylbenzene (isobutylbenzene) undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation with propionyl chloride (CH3CH2COCl) in the presence of an aluminum chloride (AlCl3) catalyst.\n- The AlCl3 activates the propionyl chloride by forming a complex with the carbonyl group, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic.\n- The activated propionyl chloride then reacts with the 2-methylpropylbenzene, attaching the propionyl group to the benzene ring via electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n\n2. Hydrolysis:\n- The ketone formed in the previous step is hydrolyzed to form a carboxylic acid. This is done by treating the ketone with a strong base, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH), followed by acidification with a strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl).\n\n3. Kolbe-Schmitt Reaction:\n- The carboxylic acid is then converted to its corresponding sodium salt by treating it with sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n- The sodium salt is then reacted with carbon dioxide (CO2) under high pressure and temperature (100-130Â°C) to form the sodium salt of the desired ibuprofen.\n- This step is known as the Kolbe-Schmitt reaction, which involves the carboxylation of the aromatic ring at the ortho position relative to the carboxylic acid group.\n\n4. Acidification:\n- Finally, the sodium salt of ibuprofen is converted to the free acid form (ibuprofen) by treating it with a strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl).\n\nThese steps provide a general overview of the synthesis of ibuprofen from 2-methylpropylbenzene and carbon dioxide. There may be variations in the specific reagents and conditions used, but the overall process remains the same."
