    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the vaporization reaction of 2.00 moles of water, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH = n * ΔHvap\n\nwhere ΔH is the standard enthalpy change, n is the number of moles of water, and ΔHvap is the molar enthalpy of vaporization.\n\nGiven:\nn = 2.00 moles\nΔHvap = 40.7 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the equation:\n\nΔH = 2.00 moles * 40.7 kJ/mol\n\nΔH = 81.4 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the vaporization reaction of 2.00 moles of water at 100°C and 1 atm pressure is 81.4 kJ."
