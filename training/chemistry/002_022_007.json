    "message_2": "To calculate the lattice energy of CaCl2 using the Born-Haber cycle and Hess's law, we need to consider the following steps:\n\n1. Sublimation of Ca metal\n2. Ionization of Ca atom\n3. Dissociation of Cl2 molecule\n4. Electron affinity of Cl atom\n5. Formation of CaCl2 lattice\n\nStep 1: Sublimation of Ca metal\nHeat of sublimation of Ca = 178 kJ/mol\n\nStep 2: Ionization of Ca atom\nFirst ionization energy of Ca = 590 kJ/mol\nSecond ionization energy of Ca = 1145 kJ/mol\nTotal ionization energy of Ca = 590 + 1145 = 1735 kJ/mol\n\nStep 3: Dissociation of Cl2 molecule\nBond energy of Cl-Cl molecule = 242 kJ/mol\n(We will use the given value of 242 kJ/mol instead of 243 kJ/mol, as it is more accurate for this calculation)\n\nStep 4: Electron affinity of Cl atom\nElectron affinity of Cl = -348 kJ/mol\nSince there are two Cl atoms in CaCl2, the total electron affinity = 2 * (-348) = -696 kJ/mol\n\nStep 5: Formation of CaCl2 lattice\nLet the lattice energy be L.\n\nNow, we can apply Hess's law to find the lattice energy:\n\nΔHf (CaCl2) = Sublimation energy + Ionization energy + Dissociation energy + Electron affinity + Lattice energy\n\nWe know that the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) of CaCl2 is -795 kJ/mol. Therefore:\n\n-795 kJ/mol = 178 kJ/mol + 1735 kJ/mol + 242 kJ/mol - 696 kJ/mol + L\n\nNow, we can solve for L:\n\nL = -795 - 178 - 1735 - 242 + 696\nL = -2254 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the lattice energy of CaCl2 is -2254 kJ/mol."
