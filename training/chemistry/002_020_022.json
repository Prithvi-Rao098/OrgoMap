    "message_2": "The compound ZnO is an ionic solid. \n\nTo understand why ZnO is an ionic solid, we need to look at the elements that make up the compound. ZnO consists of zinc (Zn) and oxygen (O) atoms. Zinc is a metal, and it is found in Group 12 of the periodic table. Oxygen, on the other hand, is a non-metal and is found in Group 16 of the periodic table. \n\nIonic compounds generally form when a metal reacts with a non-metal. In this case, zinc, being a metal, loses electrons to form a positively charged ion (cation), while oxygen, being a non-metal, gains electrons to form a negatively charged ion (anion). Specifically, zinc loses two electrons to form a Zn²⁺ ion, and oxygen gains two electrons to form an O²⁻ ion. These ions are attracted to each other due to their opposite charges, forming an ionic bond.\n\nThe resulting ionic solid, ZnO, has a crystalline structure in which the Zn²⁺ and O²⁻ ions are arranged in a regular, repeating pattern. This structure is held together by the strong electrostatic forces between the positively charged zinc ions and the negatively charged oxygen ions. These forces are responsible for the high melting and boiling points, as well as the brittleness, of ionic solids like ZnO.\n\nIn summary, ZnO is an ionic solid because it is formed by the reaction between a metal (zinc) and a non-metal (oxygen), resulting in the formation of oppositely charged ions that are held together by strong electrostatic forces in a crystalline structure."
