    "message_2": "In acidic medium, the redox reaction between MnO4- and Fe2+ can be represented as follows:\n\nMnO4- + 8H+ + 5Fe2+ â†’ Mn2+ + 5Fe3+ + 4H2O\n\nWhen the pH increases, the concentration of H+ ions decreases. According to Le Chatelier's principle, the equilibrium will shift to counteract the change in concentration. In this case, the equilibrium will shift to the left to produce more H+ ions. This means that the reaction will favor the formation of MnO4- and Fe2+ ions, and the concentration of Mn2+ and Fe3+ ions will decrease.\n\nIn summary, increasing the pH of the solution will shift the equilibrium position of the redox reaction between MnO4- and Fe2+ in acidic medium to the left, favoring the formation of MnO4- and Fe2+ ions."
