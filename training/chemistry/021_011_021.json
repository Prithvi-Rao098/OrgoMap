    "message_2": "To find the bond dissociation energy of the N-H bond in ammonia, we need to determine the energy required to break one N-H bond. First, we need to find the total energy required to dissociate all three N-H bonds in the ammonia molecule. We can do this by using the given enthalpy changes for the reactions.\n\nThe enthalpy change for the reaction NH3(g) → N(g) + 3H(g) is +437 kJ/mol. This represents the energy required to dissociate one mole of ammonia into nitrogen and hydrogen gas.\n\nThe enthalpy change for the reaction N2(g) + 3H2(g) → 2NH3(g) is -922 kJ/mol. This represents the energy released when one mole of nitrogen gas and three moles of hydrogen gas combine to form two moles of ammonia.\n\nTo find the total energy required to dissociate all three N-H bonds in one mole of ammonia, we can use Hess's Law. According to Hess's Law, the enthalpy change of a reaction is the same, whether it occurs in one step or several steps. Therefore, we can write the following equation:\n\nΔH(NH3 dissociation) = ΔH(NH3 formation) - ΔH(N2 and H2 formation)\n\nSince the enthalpy change for the reaction N2(g) + 3H2(g) → 2NH3(g) is -922 kJ/mol, the enthalpy change for the reverse reaction, 2NH3(g) → N2(g) + 3H2(g), is +922 kJ/mol.\n\nNow we can plug in the given values:\n\nΔH(NH3 dissociation) = (+922 kJ/mol) - (+437 kJ/mol)\nΔH(NH3 dissociation) = +485 kJ/mol\n\nThis is the energy required to dissociate all three N-H bonds in one mole of ammonia. To find the bond dissociation energy for one N-H bond, we can divide this value by 3:\n\nBond dissociation energy (N-H) = ΔH(NH3 dissociation) / 3\nBond dissociation energy (N-H) = (+485 kJ/mol) / 3\nBond dissociation energy (N-H) ≈ +161.7 kJ/mol\n\nThe bond dissociation energy of the nitrogen-hydrogen (N-H) bond in ammonia (NH3) molecule is approximately 161.7 kJ/mol."
