    "message_1": "What is the purity of a sample of acetanilide if its melting point range is observed to be 114.5-116째C and the literature value for pure acetanilide is 114-115째C?",
    "message_2": "The melting point of a compound is a physical property that can be used to determine the purity of a sample. A pure compound will have a sharp melting point, while an impure compound will have a broader melting point range. The closer the observed melting point range is to the literature value, the higher the purity of the sample.\n\nIn this case, the observed melting point range of the acetanilide sample is 114.5-116째C, and the literature value for pure acetanilide is 114-115째C. The observed melting point range is slightly higher and broader than the literature value, which indicates that the sample is not completely pure.\n\nHowever, it is not possible to determine the exact purity of the sample based on the melting point range alone. To determine the purity, additional methods such as chromatography, spectroscopy, or elemental analysis would be needed."
