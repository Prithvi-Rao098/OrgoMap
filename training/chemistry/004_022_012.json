    "message_2": "To determine the amount of chloride ions (Cl-) present in the 75 mL sample, you need to perform the potentiometric titration and record the volume of the 0.1 M silver nitrate (AgNO3) solution used to reach the endpoint. The endpoint is the point at which the potential difference (voltage) between the reference electrode and the working electrode changes significantly, indicating that all chloride ions have reacted with the silver ions.\n\nOnce you have the volume of the 0.1 M AgNO3 solution used, you can calculate the moles of chloride ions using the stoichiometry of the reaction:\n\nAgNO3 + NaCl → AgCl + NaNO3\n\nIn this reaction, one mole of silver nitrate reacts with one mole of sodium chloride, producing one mole of silver chloride and one mole of sodium nitrate. Since the stoichiometry is 1:1, the moles of chloride ions will be equal to the moles of silver nitrate used.\n\nTo calculate the moles of AgNO3 used, use the formula:\n\nmoles = molarity × volume\n\nAssuming you have the volume of AgNO3 used in liters (convert mL to L by dividing by 1000), you can calculate the moles of Cl-:\n\nmoles of Cl- = (0.1 M) × (volume of AgNO3 in L)\n\nOnce you have the moles of Cl-, you can calculate the concentration of Cl- in the original 75 mL sample:\n\nconcentration of Cl- = (moles of Cl-) / (0.075 L)\n\nFinally, to find the amount of chloride ions in the 75 mL sample, you can use the formula:\n\namount of Cl- (in grams) = (moles of Cl-) × (molar mass of Cl-)\n\nThe molar mass of Cl- is approximately 35.45 g/mol. Multiply the moles of Cl- by the molar mass to get the amount of chloride ions in grams."
