    "message_2": "Caffeine has the molecular formula C8H10N4O2. To determine the percent composition of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen in a 10 gram sample of caffeine, we first need to find the molar mass of caffeine and then the mass of each element in the sample.\n\n1. Calculate the molar mass of caffeine:\nC: 8 atoms × 12.01 g/mol = 96.08 g/mol\nH: 10 atoms × 1.01 g/mol = 10.10 g/mol\nN: 4 atoms × 14.01 g/mol = 56.04 g/mol\nO: 2 atoms × 16.00 g/mol = 32.00 g/mol\nTotal molar mass of caffeine = 96.08 + 10.10 + 56.04 + 32.00 = 194.22 g/mol\n\n2. Calculate the mass of each element in the 10 gram sample:\nCarbon: (96.08 g/mol / 194.22 g/mol) × 10 g = 4.94 g\nHydrogen: (10.10 g/mol / 194.22 g/mol) × 10 g = 0.52 g\nNitrogen: (56.04 g/mol / 194.22 g/mol) × 10 g = 2.88 g\n\n3. Calculate the percent composition of each element:\nCarbon: (4.94 g / 10 g) × 100% = 49.4%\nHydrogen: (0.52 g / 10 g) × 100% = 5.2%\nNitrogen: (2.88 g / 10 g) × 100% = 28.8%\n\nSo, the percent composition of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen in a 10 gram sample of caffeine is approximately 49.4% carbon, 5.2% hydrogen, and 28.8% nitrogen."
