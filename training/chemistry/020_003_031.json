    "message_1": "If the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction N2(g) + 3H2(g) <-> 2NH3(g) is 4.34 x 10^-3 at 250Â°C, and the concentration of nitrogen gas is doubled, what effect will it have on the concentration of ammonia at equilibrium?",
    "message_2": "To determine the effect of doubling the concentration of nitrogen gas on the concentration of ammonia at equilibrium, we can use the reaction quotient (Q) and compare it to the equilibrium constant (Kc). The reaction is:\n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) <-> 2NH3(g)\n\nLet's assume the initial concentrations of N2, H2, and NH3 are [N2]0, [H2]0, and [NH3]0, respectively. Now, we double the concentration of N2, so the new concentration is 2[N2]0.\n\nAt equilibrium, let the change in concentration of N2, H2, and NH3 be -x, -3x, and 2x, respectively. So, the equilibrium concentrations will be:\n\n[N2] = 2[N2]0 - x\n[H2] = [H2]0 - 3x\n[NH3] = [NH3]0 + 2x\n\nNow, we can write the expression for the equilibrium constant Kc:\n\nKc = ([NH3]^2) / ([N2] * [H2]^3)\n\nGiven Kc = 4.34 x 10^-3, we can plug in the equilibrium concentrations:\n\n4.34 x 10^-3 = (([NH3]0 + 2x)^2) / ((2[N2]0 - x) * ([H2]0 - 3x)^3)\n\nSince we don't have the initial concentrations, we cannot solve for x directly. However, we can analyze the effect of doubling the concentration of N2 on the concentration of NH3.\n\nWhen the concentration of N2 is doubled, the reaction quotient Q will be less than Kc, as the denominator in the Q expression will be larger. This means that the reaction will shift towards the products (right) to reach equilibrium again. As a result, the concentration of ammonia (NH3) will increase at the new equilibrium.\n\nIn summary, doubling the concentration of nitrogen gas will lead to an increase in the concentration of ammonia at equilibrium."
