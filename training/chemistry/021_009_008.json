    "message_2": "The bond order of an oxygen molecule (O2) can be determined using the Molecular Orbital Theory. According to this theory, the bond order is calculated as the difference between the number of electrons in bonding orbitals and the number of electrons in antibonding orbitals, divided by 2.\n\nFor O2, the electronic configuration is:\n\n1s² 2s² 2p⁴\n\nWhen the two oxygen atoms combine to form O2, the molecular orbital configuration becomes:\n\nσ1s² σ*1s² σ2s² σ*2s² π2p⁴\n\nHere, the bonding orbitals are σ1s², σ2s², and π2p⁴, which have a total of 8 electrons. The antibonding orbitals are σ*1s² and σ*2s², which have a total of 4 electrons.\n\nUsing the bond order formula:\n\nBond order = (Number of electrons in bonding orbitals - Number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\n\nBond order = (8 - 4) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2\n\nThe bond order of O2 is 2, which indicates that there are two bonds between the two oxygen atoms. A bond order of 2 suggests that the oxygen molecule is stable and has a double bond between the two oxygen atoms. The higher the bond order, the stronger and more stable the bond. In this case, the bond order of 2 indicates a relatively stable oxygen molecule."
