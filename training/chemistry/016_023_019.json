    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 0.025 moles of ethyl acetate, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH = moles × enthalpy of reaction\n\nΔH = 0.025 moles × (-56.0 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH = -1.4 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 0.025 moles of ethyl acetate is -1.4 kJ."
