    "message_2": "To calculate the corrosion potential of the copper electrode when paired with an iron electrode in a galvanic cell, we need to use the Nernst equation. The Nernst equation allows us to calculate the cell potential under non-standard conditions.\n\nThe Nernst equation is given by:\n\nE_cell = E°_cell - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\n\nwhere:\nE_cell = cell potential under non-standard conditions\nE°_cell = standard cell potential\nR = gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\nT = temperature in Kelvin (25°C = 298.15 K)\nn = number of electrons transferred in the redox reaction (n = 2 for both Cu and Fe redox reactions)\nF = Faraday's constant (96,485 C/mol)\nQ = reaction quotient\n\nFirst, we need to determine the standard cell potential (E°_cell). The cell potential is the difference between the reduction potentials of the two half-reactions:\n\nE°_cell = E°_cathode - E°_anode\n\nIn this case, the copper electrode will act as the cathode (reduction) and the iron electrode will act as the anode (oxidation). Therefore:\n\nE°_cell = E°_Cu - E°_Fe = (+0.34 V) - (-0.44 V) = +0.78 V\n\nNext, we need to determine the reaction quotient (Q). The reaction quotient is given by:\n\nQ = [Cu2+]/[Fe2+]\n\nSince both CuSO4 and FeSO4 have a concentration of 1M:\n\nQ = [1]/[1] = 1\n\nNow we can plug the values into the Nernst equation:\n\nE_cell = E°_cell - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\nE_cell = 0.78 V - ((8.314 J/mol·K) * (298.15 K) / (2 * 96,485 C/mol)) * ln(1)\n\nSince ln(1) = 0:\n\nE_cell = 0.78 V\n\nTherefore, the corrosion potential of the copper electrode when paired with an iron electrode in a galvanic cell containing 1M CuSO4 and 1M FeSO4 at 25°C is 0.78 V."
