    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of ionization of a hydrogen atom from a hydrogen molecule, we need to consider the following steps:\n\n1. Breaking the H-H bond in the hydrogen molecule (H2) to form two hydrogen atoms.\n2. Removing an electron from one of the hydrogen atoms to form a hydrogen ion (H+).\n\nStep 1: Bond dissociation enthalpy of H2\nThe bond dissociation enthalpy of H2 is given as 432 kJ/mol. This is the energy required to break the H-H bond and form two hydrogen atoms.\n\nH2 → 2H\nΔH1 = 432 kJ/mol\n\nStep 2: Ionization enthalpy of hydrogen atom\nThe ionization enthalpy of a hydrogen atom is the energy required to remove an electron from the hydrogen atom to form a hydrogen ion (H+). The electron affinity of H atom is given as -72.8 kJ/mol. The negative sign indicates that energy is released when an electron is added to a hydrogen atom to form a negatively charged ion (H-).\n\nH → H+ + e-\nΔH2 = Ionization enthalpy of hydrogen atom\n\nSince we know the electron affinity of hydrogen atom, we can use the following relationship to find the ionization enthalpy:\n\nIonization enthalpy (ΔH2) = -1 × Electron affinity\n\nΔH2 = -1 × (-72.8 kJ/mol) = 72.8 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the overall enthalpy of ionization of hydrogen atom from hydrogen molecule:\n\nΔH_total = ΔH1 + ΔH2\nΔH_total = 432 kJ/mol + 72.8 kJ/mol = 504.8 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy of ionization of hydrogen atom from hydrogen molecule is 504.8 kJ/mol."
