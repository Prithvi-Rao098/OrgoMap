    "message_2": "To determine the melting point range of a given sample of substance A, you would need to perform a melting point experiment using a melting point apparatus. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Prepare a small sample of substance A by grinding it into a fine powder.\n2. Place a small amount of the powdered sample into a capillary tube, ensuring it is tightly packed.\n3. Insert the capillary tube into the melting point apparatus and set the temperature to rise at a steady rate (e.g., 1-2Â°C per minute).\n4. Observe the sample through the magnifying lens and record the temperature at which the sample starts to melt (first drop of liquid) and the temperature at which the sample has completely melted.\n5. The range between these two temperatures is the melting point range of the given sample of substance A.\n\nTo compare the melting point range of the sample with the published melting point range for pure substance A, you would need to consult a reliable source, such as a chemical database, handbook, or scientific literature. If the melting point range of the sample is close to the published range for the pure substance, it indicates that the sample is relatively pure. If the melting point range of the sample is significantly lower or broader than the published range, it suggests that the sample may be impure or contaminated with other substances."
