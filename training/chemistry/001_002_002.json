    "message_2": "2-pentene and 2-methyl-1-butene exhibit positional isomerism, which is a type of structural isomerism. In positional isomers, the molecular formula is the same, but the position of the functional group or substituent differs.\n\n2-pentene has the molecular formula C5H10 and contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) at the second carbon atom in the chain. Its structure can be represented as CH3-CH=CH-CH2-CH3.\n\n2-methyl-1-butene also has the molecular formula C5H10, but the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) is at the first carbon atom in the chain, and there is a methyl group (CH3) attached to the second carbon atom. Its structure can be represented as CH2=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3.\n\nIn summary, the structural difference between these two positional isomers lies in the location of the double bond and the methyl group within the carbon chain."
