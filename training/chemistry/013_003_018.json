    "message_2": "The Langmuir adsorption isotherm equation is given by:\n\nθ = (P * K) / (1 + P * K)\n\nwhere:\nθ is the fractional coverage of the adsorbent surface (dimensionless)\nP is the equilibrium pressure of the gas (in atm, Pa, or any other pressure unit)\nK is the Langmuir constant (in the reciprocal of the pressure unit used for P)\n\nThe maximum adsorption capacity of a solid adsorbent for a gas occurs when the surface is fully covered, i.e., when θ = 1. In this case, the Langmuir equation becomes:\n\n1 = (P * K) / (1 + P * K)\n\nTo find the maximum adsorption capacity, we need to solve for P:\n\nP * K = 1\nP = 1 / K\n\nNow, to find the maximum adsorption capacity, we need to know the amount of gas adsorbed per unit mass or volume of the adsorbent. This can be expressed as:\n\nq = q_max * θ\n\nwhere:\nq is the amount of gas adsorbed (in moles or mass units)\nq_max is the maximum adsorption capacity of the solid adsorbent (in moles or mass units)\n\nSince θ = 1 at maximum adsorption capacity:\n\nq_max = q\n\nSo, the maximum adsorption capacity of the solid adsorbent for a gas is equal to the amount of gas adsorbed when the surface is fully covered, which can be determined using the equilibrium pressure (P = 1 / K) and the Langmuir constant (K) at a certain temperature."
