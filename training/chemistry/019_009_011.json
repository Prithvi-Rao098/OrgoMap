    "message_2": "To calculate the standard free energy change (ΔG°) for the redox reaction, we can use the Nernst equation:\n\nΔG° = -nFE°\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the reaction, F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol), and E° is the standard cell potential.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the balanced redox reaction and the number of electrons transferred. The given half-reactions are:\n\nMg2+ + 2e- -> Mg (E° = -2.37 V) - Reduction half-reaction\nO2 + 4e- + 2H2O -> 4OH- (E° = +1.23 V) - Reduction half-reaction\n\nWe need to reverse the first half-reaction to make it an oxidation half-reaction:\n\nMg -> Mg2+ + 2e- (E° = +2.37 V) - Oxidation half-reaction\n\nNow, we need to balance the electrons in both half-reactions. Since the oxidation half-reaction involves 2 electrons and the reduction half-reaction involves 4 electrons, we need to multiply the oxidation half-reaction by 2:\n\n2Mg -> 2Mg2+ + 4e- (E° = +2.37 V)\n\nNow, we can add the balanced half-reactions:\n\n2Mg + O2 + 4e- + 2H2O -> 2Mg2+ + 4OH- + 4e-\n\nThe electrons cancel out:\n\n2Mg + O2 + 2H2O -> 2Mg2+ + 4OH-\n\nNow, we can combine Mg2+ and OH- to form MgO:\n\n2Mg + O2 + 2H2O -> 2MgO + 2H2O\n\nFinally, we can cancel out the water molecules:\n\n2Mg + O2 -> 2MgO\n\nNow that we have the balanced redox reaction, we can calculate the standard cell potential (E°) by adding the potentials of the half-reactions:\n\nE° = E°(oxidation) + E°(reduction)\nE° = +2.37 V + (+1.23 V)\nE° = +3.60 V\n\nSince the balanced redox reaction involves 4 moles of electrons (n = 4), we can now calculate the standard free energy change (ΔG°):\n\nΔG° = -nFE°\nΔG° = -(4 mol)(96,485 C/mol)(3.60 V)\nΔG° = -1,387,032 J/mol\n\nSo, the standard free energy change for the redox reaction at 298 K is -1,387,032 J/mol."
