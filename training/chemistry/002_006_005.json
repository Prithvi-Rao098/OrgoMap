    "message_2": "To calculate the molar mass of Sodium Chloride (NaCl), we need to find the sum of the molar masses of Sodium (Na) and Chlorine (Cl).\n\nThe molar mass of Sodium (Na) is approximately 22.99 g/mol, and the molar mass of Chlorine (Cl) is approximately 35.45 g/mol.\n\nSo, the molar mass of Sodium Chloride (NaCl) is:\n\nMolar mass of NaCl = Molar mass of Na + Molar mass of Cl\nMolar mass of NaCl = 22.99 g/mol + 35.45 g/mol\nMolar mass of NaCl = 58.44 g/mol\n\nTherefore, the molar mass of Sodium Chloride (NaCl) is approximately 58.44 grams per mole."
