    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of vaporization of benzene, we need to determine the number of moles of benzene in 100 grams and then use the given energy requirement to find the enthalpy of vaporization per mole.\n\nFirst, we need to find the molar mass of benzene (C6H6):\nC: 12.01 g/mol (6 carbon atoms)\nH: 1.01 g/mol (6 hydrogen atoms)\n\nMolar mass of benzene = (6 × 12.01) + (6 × 1.01) = 72.06 + 6.06 = 78.12 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the number of moles in 100 grams of benzene:\nmoles = mass / molar mass = 100 g / 78.12 g/mol = 1.280 moles\n\nGiven that it requires 45.8 kJ/mol of energy to vaporize 100 grams of benzene, we can now find the enthalpy of vaporization per mole:\n\nEnthalpy of vaporization = Energy required / moles\nEnthalpy of vaporization = 45.8 kJ / 1.280 moles = 35.8 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the enthalpy of vaporization of benzene is approximately 35.8 kJ/mol."
