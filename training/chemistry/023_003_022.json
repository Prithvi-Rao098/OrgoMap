    "message_2": "The optimum reaction temperature and time for the synthesis of nylon-6,6 from adipic acid and hexamethylenediamine can vary depending on the specific process and conditions used. However, a general guideline is as follows:\n\nTemperature: The reaction is typically carried out at temperatures between 250-285째C (482-545째F). A common temperature used is around 270째C (518째F).\n\nTime: The reaction time can range from a few minutes to several hours, depending on the desired molecular weight and degree of polymerization. A common reaction time is around 2-4 hours.\n\nIt is important to note that these values can vary depending on the specific process, catalysts, and reaction conditions used. Optimizing the temperature and time for a particular setup may require experimentation and adjustments based on the desired properties of the final product."
