    "message_2": "The standard electrode potential for the redox reaction Fe3+(aq) + e- → Fe2+(aq) is already given in the problem statement. It is +0.771 V. There is no need to involve the standard electrode potential for the reduction of H+(aq) to H2(g) in this case, as it is not part of the reaction being considered."
