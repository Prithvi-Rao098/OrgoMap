    "message_2": "To find the density of a substance, we need to know its mass and volume. However, the information provided only gives the molar mass of copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO4·5H2O) and the temperature and pressure conditions. \n\nTo find the density, we would need additional information, such as the mass and volume of a sample of the substance or its solubility in water to calculate the density of the resulting solution. Without this information, it is not possible to determine the density of copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate under the given conditions."
