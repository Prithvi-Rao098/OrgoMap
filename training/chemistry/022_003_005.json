    "message_2": "To find the pH of a 0.1 M solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl), we can use the formula:\n\npH = -log10[H+]\n\nHydrochloric acid is a strong acid, which means it dissociates completely in water to form H+ and Cl- ions. In this case, the concentration of H+ ions is equal to the concentration of the HCl solution, which is 0.1 M.\n\nNow we can plug this value into the formula:\n\npH = -log10(0.1)\n\npH = -(-1)\n\npH = 1\n\nSo, the pH of a 0.1 M solution of hydrochloric acid is 1."
