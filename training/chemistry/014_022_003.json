    "message_2": "Cytochrome c oxidase is a metalloenzyme that plays a crucial role in cellular respiration by catalyzing the reduction of molecular oxygen (O2) to water (H2O). The active site of cytochrome c oxidase contains two metal ions: a high-spin heme a3 iron (Fe) and a copper ion (CuB).\n\nThe coordination geometry of the heme a3 iron (Fe) is octahedral. The iron is coordinated to a histidine imidazole nitrogen, a porphyrin nitrogen, and an oxygen molecule. The oxygen molecule bridges the iron and copper ions.\n\nThe coordination geometry of the copper ion (CuB) is square planar. The copper ion is coordinated to three histidine imidazole nitrogens and the bridging oxygen molecule.\n\nThe oxidation state of the heme a3 iron (Fe) in the active site varies during the catalytic cycle. It can be in the Fe(III) or Fe(IV) state. The copper ion (CuB) also changes its oxidation state during the catalytic cycle, fluctuating between Cu(I) and Cu(II).\n\nIn the fully oxidized state, the heme a3 iron (Fe) is in the Fe(IV) state, and the copper ion (CuB) is in the Cu(II) state. During the four-electron reduction of O2 to H2O, the oxidation states of the metal ions change to facilitate the transfer of electrons and protons, ultimately returning to their initial oxidation states at the end of the catalytic cycle."
