    "message_2": "To find the mass of iron (II) sulfate (FeSO4) in the sample, we can use the given percentage composition and the mass of the sample.\n\nPercentage composition of FeSO4 = 40.5%\nMass of the sample = 2.50 grams\n\nTo find the mass of FeSO4 in the sample, multiply the mass of the sample by the percentage composition of FeSO4:\n\nMass of FeSO4 = (Percentage composition of FeSO4 / 100) × Mass of the sample\nMass of FeSO4 = (40.5 / 100) × 2.50 grams\nMass of FeSO4 = 0.405 × 2.50 grams\nMass of FeSO4 = 1.0125 grams\n\nTherefore, the mass of iron (II) sulfate in the 2.50 gram sample is approximately 1.01 grams."
