    "message_2": "To calculate the standard free energy change (ΔGº) for the redox reaction, we first need to determine the standard cell potential (Eºcell) for the reaction. The cell potential can be found using the Nernst equation:\n\nEºcell = Eºred(cathode) - Eºred(anode)\n\nIn this reaction, Mg is being oxidized (losing electrons) and H+ is being reduced (gaining electrons). Therefore, Mg is the anode and H+ is the cathode. We are given the standard reduction potentials for both half-reactions:\n\nEºred(Mg2+/Mg) = -2.37 V (anode)\nEºred(H+/H2) = 0 V (cathode)\n\nNow we can calculate the standard cell potential:\n\nEºcell = 0 V - (-2.37 V) = 2.37 V\n\nNext, we can use the relationship between the standard cell potential and the standard free energy change:\n\nΔGº = -nFEºcell\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the reaction (in this case, 2 moles) and F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol).\n\nΔGº = -(2 mol)(96,485 C/mol)(2.37 V) = -457,331.9 J/mol\n\nSince the standard free energy change is typically expressed in kJ/mol, we can convert the value:\n\nΔGº = -457.33 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard free energy change for the given redox reaction at 298 K is -457.33 kJ/mol."
