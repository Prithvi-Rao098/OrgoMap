    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 2 moles of sucrose, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH_reaction = Σ ΔH_products - Σ ΔH_reactants\n\nFor this reaction, the reactants are 2 moles of sucrose and the products are 2 moles of glucose and 2 moles of fructose. Therefore, we can write the equation as:\n\nΔH_reaction = (2 × ΔH_glucose + 2 × ΔH_fructose) - (2 × ΔH_sucrose)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values for the enthalpy of formation of glucose, fructose, and sucrose:\n\nΔH_reaction = (2 × -1273 kJ/mol + 2 × -1260 kJ/mol) - (2 × -2226 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH_reaction = (-2546 kJ + -2520 kJ) - (-4452 kJ)\n\nΔH_reaction = -5066 kJ + 4452 kJ\n\nΔH_reaction = -614 kJ\n\nSo, the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 2 moles of sucrose into glucose and fructose is -614 kJ."
