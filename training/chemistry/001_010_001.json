    "message_2": "When propanal (an aldehyde) is treated with Tollens' reagent, it undergoes an oxidation reaction to form a carboxylic acid. In this case, propanoic acid is formed as the product. Tollens' reagent contains silver ions (Ag+) which are reduced to metallic silver (Ag) during the reaction. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nCH3CH2CHO + 2Ag(NH3)2OH â†’ CH3CH2COOH + 2Ag + 4NH3 + H2O\n\nExplanation of the reaction:\n\nTollens' reagent, which is ammoniacal silver nitrate [Ag(NH3)2OH], is a mild oxidizing agent. It is commonly used to test for the presence of aldehydes. When an aldehyde like propanal reacts with Tollens' reagent, the aldehyde group (-CHO) is oxidized to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). In this case, propanal (CH3CH2CHO) is oxidized to propanoic acid (CH3CH2COOH).\n\nDuring the oxidation process, the silver ions (Ag+) in Tollens' reagent are reduced to metallic silver (Ag). This reduction is evidenced by the formation of a silver mirror on the inner surface of the reaction vessel. The ammonia (NH3) and water (H2O) are also produced as byproducts in the reaction."
