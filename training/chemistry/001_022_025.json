    "message_2": "The Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement and Friedel-Crafts rearrangement are two distinct reactions in organic chemistry, involving the migration of different groups and occurring under different conditions.\n\n1. Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement:\nIn a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, a hydrogen atom migrates from one carbon atom to an adjacent electron-deficient carbon atom, typically a carbocation. This migration occurs to stabilize the carbocation by forming a more stable carbocation, such as a tertiary carbocation from a secondary one. The reaction proceeds through a concerted mechanism, where the hydrogen atom migrates simultaneously as the carbocation is formed. This rearrangement is generally observed in solvolysis reactions and is driven by the need to stabilize the carbocation intermediate.\n\n2. Friedel-Crafts rearrangement:\nIn a Friedel-Crafts rearrangement, an alkyl or aryl group migrates from one carbon atom to another, usually an aromatic ring, in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst. The reaction involves the formation of a carbocation intermediate, which then reacts with the aromatic ring to form a new carbon-carbon bond. The Friedel-Crafts rearrangement can be classified into two types: Friedel-Crafts alkylation and Friedel-Crafts acylation. In both cases, the migrating group is an alkyl or aryl group, not a hydrogen atom.\n\nIn summary, the main differences between the migration of a hydrogen atom in a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement and the migration of an alkyl or aryl group in a Friedel-Crafts rearrangement are:\n\n1. The migrating group: In Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, a hydrogen atom migrates, while in Friedel-Crafts rearrangement, an alkyl or aryl group migrates.\n2. The purpose of migration: In Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, migration occurs to stabilize a carbocation, while in Friedel-Crafts rearrangement, migration occurs to form a new carbon-carbon bond with an aromatic ring.\n3. Reaction conditions: Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement typically occurs during solvolysis reactions, while Friedel-Crafts rearrangement requires a Lewis acid catalyst."
