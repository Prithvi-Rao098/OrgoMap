    "message_2": "An increase in temperature affects the equilibrium position of a reaction and the concentrations of the reactants and products according to Le Chatelier's principle. Le Chatelier's principle states that if a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in temperature, pressure, or concentration of reactants and products, the system will adjust its equilibrium position to counteract the change.\n\nWhen the temperature of a reaction at equilibrium is increased, the system will respond by favoring the reaction that absorbs heat, also known as the endothermic reaction. Conversely, if the temperature is decreased, the system will favor the reaction that releases heat, known as the exothermic reaction.\n\nFor an endothermic reaction (ΔH > 0), an increase in temperature will shift the equilibrium position to the right, favoring the formation of products. This results in an increase in the concentration of products and a decrease in the concentration of reactants.\n\nFor an exothermic reaction (ΔH < 0), an increase in temperature will shift the equilibrium position to the left, favoring the formation of reactants. This results in an increase in the concentration of reactants and a decrease in the concentration of products.\n\nIn summary, an increase in temperature will affect the equilibrium position of a reaction by favoring the endothermic reaction, leading to changes in the concentrations of reactants and products depending on whether the reaction is endothermic or exothermic."
