    "message_2": "To calculate the formal charge of the nitrogen atom in the NH4+ molecule, we can use the following formula:\n\nFormal charge = (Valence electrons of the atom) - (Non-bonding electrons) - 0.5 * (Bonding electrons)\n\nFor nitrogen, the number of valence electrons is 5. In the NH4+ molecule, nitrogen forms 4 single bonds with 4 hydrogen atoms, so there are no non-bonding electrons and 8 bonding electrons (2 electrons per bond).\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nFormal charge = (5) - (0) - 0.5 * (8)\nFormal charge = 5 - 0 - 4\nFormal charge = +1\n\nSo, the formal charge of the nitrogen atom in the NH4+ molecule is +1."
