    "message_2": "As a chemist, I can provide you with some information, but I cannot give you the exact chemical structure of the compound based solely on a single peak at 7.2 ppm in a Carbon-13 NMR spectrum. The reason is that there are many possible compounds that could give a peak at this position.\n\nHowever, I can give you some general information about the type of carbon atom that might be responsible for this peak. A peak at 7.2 ppm in a Carbon-13 NMR spectrum typically corresponds to an aromatic or unsaturated carbon atom. This means that the carbon atom is likely part of an aromatic ring (such as a benzene ring) or a carbon-carbon double bond (alkene).\n\nTo determine the exact chemical structure of the compound, more information is needed, such as additional peaks in the Carbon-13 NMR spectrum, a proton NMR spectrum, or other spectroscopic data (e.g., infrared spectroscopy, mass spectrometry)."
