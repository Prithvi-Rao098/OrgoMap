    "message_2": "Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful analytical technique used to determine the structure of unknown compounds and investigate the number and environment of hydrogen atoms present in the compound. Here's how you can use NMR data to achieve this:\n\n1. Obtain the proton NMR (1H-NMR) spectrum of the unknown compound. This will provide information about the hydrogen atoms in the compound.\n\n2. Analyze the chemical shifts (Î´) of the peaks in the spectrum. Chemical shifts are measured in parts per million (ppm) and are influenced by the electronic environment of the hydrogen atoms. Different functional groups and neighboring atoms will cause different chemical shifts. Compare the observed chemical shifts with reference tables to help identify the functional groups present in the compound.\n\n3. Examine the integration of the peaks, which indicates the relative number of hydrogen atoms contributing to each peak. This information helps to determine the ratio of hydrogen atoms in different environments.\n\n4. Analyze the multiplicity (splitting) of the peaks. The splitting pattern of a peak is determined by the number of neighboring hydrogen atoms (n) following the n+1 rule. For example, a hydrogen with three neighboring hydrogens will have a quartet (4 peaks) in the spectrum. The splitting patterns can help to determine the connectivity of hydrogen atoms in the compound.\n\n5. Obtain the carbon NMR (13C-NMR) spectrum of the unknown compound. This will provide information about the carbon atoms in the compound. Analyze the chemical shifts of the carbon peaks and compare them with reference tables to help identify the functional groups and carbon environments.\n\n6. Use 2D NMR techniques, such as COSY (correlation spectroscopy) and HSQC (heteronuclear single quantum coherence), to further elucidate the structure of the compound. COSY provides information about the coupling between hydrogen atoms, while HSQC correlates hydrogen atoms with their directly bonded carbon atoms.\n\n7. Combine all the information obtained from the NMR data to propose a structure for the unknown compound. Verify the proposed structure by comparing it with other spectroscopic data (e.g., infrared spectroscopy, mass spectrometry) and/or by synthesizing a known compound with the same structure and comparing their NMR spectra.\n\nBy following these steps, you can use NMR spectroscopy data to identify the structure of an unknown compound and determine the number and environment of hydrogen atoms present in the compound."
