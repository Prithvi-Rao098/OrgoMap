    "message_1": "A student wants to find out the cell potential of a voltaic cell made up of a nickel electrode and an iron electrode. The nickel electrode is in a 0.1 M nickel (II) sulfate solution, and the iron electrode is in a 0.1 M iron (II) sulfate solution. What is the cell potential of this voltaic cell at standard conditions (25°C and 1 atm of pressure) given the standard reduction potentials for Ni2+/Ni and Fe2+/Fe are -0.25 V and -0.44 V, respectively?",
    "message_2": "To find the cell potential of the voltaic cell, we need to determine which electrode will act as the anode (oxidation) and which will act as the cathode (reduction). The electrode with the lower reduction potential will be the anode, and the electrode with the higher reduction potential will be the cathode.\n\nIn this case, the reduction potentials are:\nNi2+/Ni: -0.25 V\nFe2+/Fe: -0.44 V\n\nSince -0.44 V is lower than -0.25 V, the iron electrode will act as the anode, and the nickel electrode will act as the cathode.\n\nNow we can calculate the cell potential using the Nernst equation:\n\nE_cell = E_cathode - E_anode\n\nE_cell = (-0.25 V) - (-0.44 V)\n\nE_cell = 0.19 V\n\nSo, the cell potential of this voltaic cell at standard conditions (25°C and 1 atm of pressure) is 0.19 V."
