    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change for the reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG = ΔG(products) - ΔG(reactants)\n\nFor the given reaction, we have:\n\n2H2(g) + O2(g) -> 2H2O(g)\n\nThe standard Gibbs free energy change of formation for H2O(g) is -228.6 kJ/mol, and for H2(g) and O2(g), it is 0 kJ/mol.\n\nΔG(products) = 2 * (-228.6 kJ/mol) = -457.2 kJ/mol\nΔG(reactants) = 2 * 0 kJ/mol + 0 kJ/mol = 0 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the Gibbs free energy change for the reaction:\n\nΔG = ΔG(products) - ΔG(reactants) = -457.2 kJ/mol - 0 kJ/mol = -457.2 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the Gibbs free energy change for the reaction is -457.2 kJ/mol."
