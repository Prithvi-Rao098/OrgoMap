    "message_2": "The Lewis structure of carbon dioxide (CO2) consists of a carbon atom (C) double-bonded to two oxygen atoms (O). Here's a simple representation of the structure:\n\nO=C=O\n\nIn this structure, the carbon atom shares two pairs of electrons with each oxygen atom, forming two double bonds. The carbon atom has a total of 4 valence electrons, while each oxygen atom has 6 valence electrons. By forming double bonds, all atoms achieve a full octet, satisfying the octet rule."
