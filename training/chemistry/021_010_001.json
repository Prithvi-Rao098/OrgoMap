    "message_1": "What is the bond enthalpy of the carbon-hydrogen bond in methane (CH4) at a room temperature of 25°C?",
    "message_2": "The bond enthalpy, also known as bond dissociation energy, is the energy required to break a specific chemical bond in a molecule. The bond enthalpy of the carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond in methane (CH4) is approximately 414 kJ/mol at room temperature (25°C). This value is an average, as bond enthalpies can vary depending on the specific molecule and its environment."
