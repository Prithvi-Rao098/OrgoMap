    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Ka) for the ionization of acetic acid (CH3COOH) in water, we need to use the equilibrium expression and the given concentrations of the species involved.\n\nThe ionization reaction of acetic acid in water is:\n\nCH3COOH (aq) + H2O (l) ⇌ CH3COO- (aq) + H3O+ (aq)\n\nThe equilibrium expression for this reaction is:\n\nKa = [CH3COO-][H3O+] / [CH3COOH]\n\nWe are given the concentration of acetic acid [CH3COOH] = 0.1 M and the concentration of its conjugate base (acetate ion) [CH3COO-] = 0.01 M. Since acetic acid is a weak acid, we can assume that the concentration of hydronium ions [H3O+] is equal to the concentration of acetate ions [CH3COO-]. Therefore, [H3O+] = 0.01 M.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equilibrium expression:\n\nKa = (0.01)(0.01) / (0.1)\nKa = 0.0001\n\nThe equilibrium constant for the ionization of acetic acid in water at 25°C is 0.0001."
