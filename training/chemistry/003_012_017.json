    "message_2": "The diffusion coefficient (D) of a gas can be calculated using the Chapman-Enskog equation:\n\nD = (3.0 × 10^(-7) × T^(3/2)) / (P × (d1 + d2)² × (M1^(1/3) + M2^(1/3))^2)\n\nwhere:\n- D is the diffusion coefficient (in m²/s)\n- T is the temperature in Kelvin (K)\n- P is the pressure in atm\n- d1 and d2 are the molecular diameters of the two gases (in Å)\n- M1 and M2 are the molar masses of the two gases (in g/mol)\n\nFor oxygen gas (O2) in air, we can assume that air is primarily composed of nitrogen gas (N2). The values for the molecular diameters and molar masses are:\n\n- d1 (O2) = 3.46 Å\n- d2 (N2) = 3.64 Å\n- M1 (O2) = 32 g/mol\n- M2 (N2) = 28 g/mol\n\nAt 25°C and atmospheric pressure, the temperature and pressure values are:\n\n- T = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\n- P = 1 atm\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Chapman-Enskog equation:\n\nD = (3.0 × 10^(-7) × (298.15)^(3/2)) / (1 × (3.46 + 3.64)² × (32^(1/3) + 28^(1/3))^2)\n\nD ≈ 2.12 × 10^(-5) m²/s\n\nSo, the diffusion coefficient of oxygen gas in air at 25°C and atmospheric pressure is approximately 2.12 × 10^(-5) m²/s."
