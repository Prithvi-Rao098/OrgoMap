    "message_2": "The knowledge of the molecular structure of a specific target virus can be used to design drugs that selectively and effectively target the virus while minimizing side effects on human cells through the following steps:\n\n1. Identify viral proteins and their functions: The first step is to identify the viral proteins that are essential for the virus's replication, assembly, and entry into human cells. These proteins are potential targets for drug development.\n\n2. Study the molecular structure of viral proteins: Once the target proteins are identified, their molecular structures can be studied using techniques like X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Understanding the three-dimensional structure of these proteins helps in identifying their active sites or regions that are crucial for their function.\n\n3. Structure-based drug design: With the knowledge of the molecular structure of the target viral proteins, researchers can use computational methods like molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and virtual screening to identify potential drug candidates that can bind to the active sites of these proteins and inhibit their function.\n\n4. Selectivity and specificity: By designing drugs that specifically target viral proteins, it is possible to minimize side effects on human cells. This is because the drugs will have a higher affinity for the viral proteins than for human proteins, reducing the likelihood of off-target effects.\n\n5. Optimization of drug candidates: Once potential drug candidates are identified, they can be further optimized for potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion). This can be done through medicinal chemistry approaches, such as modifying the chemical structure of the drug candidates to improve their binding affinity, stability, and solubility.\n\n6. In vitro and in vivo testing: The optimized drug candidates can then be tested in vitro (in cell cultures) and in vivo (in animal models) to evaluate their efficacy against the target virus and their safety profile.\n\n7. Clinical trials: If the drug candidates show promising results in preclinical studies, they can proceed to clinical trials, where their safety and efficacy are tested in human subjects.\n\n8. Regulatory approval and post-marketing surveillance: If the drug candidates successfully pass clinical trials, they can be submitted for regulatory approval. Once approved, the drugs can be marketed and prescribed to patients. Post-marketing surveillance is conducted to monitor the drug's safety and efficacy in real-world settings.\n\nBy following these steps, the knowledge of the molecular structure of a specific target virus can be used to design drugs that selectively and effectively target the virus while minimizing side effects on human cells."
