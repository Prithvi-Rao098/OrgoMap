    "message_2": "To balance the chemical equation, we need to make sure that the number of atoms of each element on the reactant side is equal to the number of atoms of the same element on the product side.\n\nThe given chemical equation is:\n\nFe + O2 -> Fe2O3\n\nFirst, let's balance the Fe (iron) atoms:\n\n2Fe + O2 -> Fe2O3\n\nNow, we have 2 Fe atoms on both sides. Next, let's balance the O (oxygen) atoms:\n\n2Fe + 3/2 O2 -> Fe2O3\n\nHowever, it's not ideal to have a fraction in a balanced chemical equation. To remove the fraction, we can multiply the entire equation by 2:\n\n2(2Fe + 3/2 O2) -> 2(Fe2O3)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n4Fe + 3O2 -> 2Fe2O3\n\nNow, the chemical equation is balanced with 4 Fe atoms and 6 O atoms on both sides."
