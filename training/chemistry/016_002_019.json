C3H8 (g) + 5O2 (g) → 3CO2 (g) + 4H2O (g) ΔH1 = -2043.1 kJ/mol \n2. C3H8 (g) + 5O2 (g) → 3CO2 (g) + 4H2O (l) ΔH2 = -2220.1 kJ/mol\n3. H2 (g) + 1/2O2 (g) → H2O (g) ΔH3 = -241.8 kJ/mol",
    "message_2": "To find the enthalpy change for the combustion of propane (C3H8) using Hess's Law, we need to manipulate the given reactions to obtain the desired reaction. The desired reaction is the combustion of propane:\n\nC3H8 (g) + 5O2 (g) → 3CO2 (g) + 4H2O (l)\n\nWe can see that reaction 2 is the desired reaction, but the product is H2O (g) instead of H2O (l). To convert H2O (g) to H2O (l), we can use reaction 3. Since there are 4 moles of H2O in the desired reaction, we need to multiply reaction 3 by 4:\n\n4(H2 (g) + 1/2O2 (g) → H2O (g)) → 4H2 (g) + 2O2 (g) → 4H2O (g) ΔH3' = 4 * (-241.8 kJ/mol) = -967.2 kJ/mol\n\nNow we can add reaction 2 and the modified reaction 3 to obtain the desired reaction:\n\nReaction 2: C3H8 (g) + 5O2 (g) → 3CO2 (g) + 4H2O (g) ΔH2 = -2043.1 kJ/mol\nReaction 3': 4H2O (g) → 4H2O (l) ΔH3' = -967.2 kJ/mol\n----------------------------------------------\nDesired Reaction: C3H8 (g) + 5O2 (g) → 3CO2 (g) + 4H2O (l) ΔH = ΔH2 + ΔH3'\n\nNow we can calculate the enthalpy change for the desired reaction:\n\nΔH = ΔH2 + ΔH3' = -2043.1 kJ/mol + (-967.2 kJ/mol) = -3010.3 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the enthalpy change for the combustion of propane (C3H8) is -3010.3 kJ/mol."
