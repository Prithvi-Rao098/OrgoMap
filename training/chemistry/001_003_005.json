    "message_2": "(2R,3S)-butanedioic acid has two chirality centers: C2 and C3. The IUPAC name for this compound is (2R,3S)-2,3-dihydroxybutanedioic acid. The structure of this compound is as follows:\n\nHOOC-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-COOH\n\nTo draw all possible stereoisomers, we need to consider the different configurations at both chirality centers. There are 2^2 = 4 possible stereoisomers:\n\n1. (2R,3S)-butanedioic acid: HOOC-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-COOH\n2. (2S,3S)-butanedioic acid: HOOC-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-COOH\n3. (2R,3R)-butanedioic acid: HOOC-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-COOH\n4. (2S,3R)-butanedioic acid: HOOC-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-COOH\n\nThe enantiomer of (2R,3S)-butanedioic acid is the molecule with the opposite configuration at both chirality centers. In this case, the enantiomer is (2S,3R)-butanedioic acid."
