    "message_2": "To calculate the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) for the reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG° = Σ [ΔGf°(products)] - Σ [ΔGf°(reactants)]\n\nwhere ΔGf° is the standard Gibbs free energy of formation for each substance.\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\n2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(l)\n\nThe standard Gibbs free energy of formation for each substance at 25°C is:\n\nH2O(l): -237.2 kJ/mol\nH2(g): 0 kJ/mol\nO2(g): 0 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔG° = [2 × (-237.2 kJ/mol)] - [2 × (0 kJ/mol) + 1 × (0 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔG° = [-474.4 kJ/mol] - [0 kJ/mol]\n\nΔG° = -474.4 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard Gibbs free energy change for the reaction at 25°C is -474.4 kJ/mol."
