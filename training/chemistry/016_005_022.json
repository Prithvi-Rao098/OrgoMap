    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of combustion of butane (C4H10), we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH_combustion = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nThe balanced combustion reaction for butane is:\n\nC4H10 + 6.5 O2 → 4 CO2 + 5 H2O\n\nNow, we can plug in the given heat of formation values for each compound:\n\nΔH_combustion = [4(-393.5) + 5(-241.8)] - [(-126.6) + 6.5(0)]\n\nNote that the heat of formation for O2 is 0 kJ/mol since it is in its standard state.\n\nΔH_combustion = [-1574 + (-1209)] - [-126.6]\n\nΔH_combustion = -2783 + 126.6\n\nΔH_combustion = -2656.4 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy of combustion of butane (C4H10) is -2656.4 kJ/mol."
