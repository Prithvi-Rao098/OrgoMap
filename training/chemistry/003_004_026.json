Calculate the cell potential and the free energy change (∆G) for the electrochemical cell.",
    "message_2": "When a copper electrode is placed in a 1 M CuSO4 solution, it forms a half-cell with the following reduction half-reaction:\n\nCu2+ (aq) + 2e- -> Cu (s)\n\nThe standard reduction potential (E°) for this half-reaction is given as +0.34 V. Since the concentration of Cu2+ ions is 1 M, which is the standard state, the potential of the copper electrode in this solution remains the same as the standard potential, which is +0.34 V.\n\nNow, let's assume that this half-cell is connected to another half-cell with a standard potential of 0 V (for example, a standard hydrogen electrode). The cell potential (E_cell) can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nE_cell = E°_cathode - E°_anode\n\nIn this case, the copper half-cell is the cathode, and the other half-cell (with a standard potential of 0 V) is the anode. So, the cell potential is:\n\nE_cell = +0.34 V - 0 V = +0.34 V\n\nNow, we can calculate the free energy change (∆G) for the electrochemical cell using the following equation:\n\n∆G = -nFE_cell\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the redox reaction (in this case, n = 2), F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol), and E_cell is the cell potential.\n\n∆G = -2 * 96,485 C/mol * 0.34 V\n∆G = -65,609.4 J/mol\n\nSo, the free energy change for the electrochemical cell is -65,609.4 J/mol."
