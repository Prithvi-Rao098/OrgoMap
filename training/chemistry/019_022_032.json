    "message_1": "Calculate the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the reaction of combustion of 1 mole of ethanol (C2H5OH) given that the standard enthalpy of formation (ΔH°f) for ethanol and carbon dioxide (CO2) are -277.7 kJ/mol and -393.5 kJ/mol respectively, and the standard enthalpy of formation (ΔH°f) for water (H2O) is -285.8 kJ/mol. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is as follows:\n\nC2H5OH (l) + 3 O2 (g) → 2 CO2 (g) + 3 H2O (l)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the combustion of 1 mole of ethanol, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH° = Σ ΔH°f (products) - Σ ΔH°f (reactants)\n\nFor the balanced chemical equation:\n\nC2H5OH (l) + 3 O2 (g) → 2 CO2 (g) + 3 H2O (l)\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation (ΔH°f) for the products are:\n- CO2: -393.5 kJ/mol\n- H2O: -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation (ΔH°f) for the reactants are:\n- C2H5OH: -277.7 kJ/mol\n- O2: 0 kJ/mol (since O2 is in its standard state)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔH° = [2(-393.5) + 3(-285.8)] - [-277.7 + 3(0)]\n\nΔH° = [-787 + (-857.4)] - [-277.7]\n\nΔH° = -1644.4 + 277.7\n\nΔH° = -1366.7 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the combustion of 1 mole of ethanol is -1366.7 kJ/mol."
