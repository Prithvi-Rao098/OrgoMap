    "message_1": "What is the chemical structure of compound X, as determined by analyzing its nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum?",
    "message_2": "As an AI language model, I am unable to analyze actual nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra or provide experimental data. To determine the chemical structure of compound X, you would need to provide the NMR data or describe the peaks and their characteristics in the spectrum.\n\nOnce you provide the NMR data, I can help you interpret the results and suggest a possible chemical structure for compound X."
