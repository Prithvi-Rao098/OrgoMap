    "message_2": "The predicted color of a compound with the chemical formula CuSO4 (copper(II) sulfate) is blue. This is due to the presence of the copper(II) ion, which imparts a characteristic blue color to the compound. When CuSO4 is in its hydrated form, CuSO4Â·5H2O, it is known as blue vitriol or bluestone, and has a bright blue color."
