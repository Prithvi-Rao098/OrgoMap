    "message_2": "The critical micelle concentration (CMC) of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) at room temperature (25Â°C) is approximately 8.2 mM (millimolar). However, this value can vary slightly depending on factors such as the purity of the SDS and the presence of other substances in the solution."
