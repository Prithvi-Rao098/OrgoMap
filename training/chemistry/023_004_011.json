    "message_2": "To determine the quantity of acetylsalicylic acid that can be synthesized from the given amounts of salicylic acid and acetic anhydride, we need to use stoichiometry. First, we need to know the balanced chemical equation for the synthesis of acetylsalicylic acid:\n\nC7H6O3 (salicylic acid) + C4H6O3 (acetic anhydride) â†’ C9H8O4 (acetylsalicylic acid) + C2H4O2 (acetic acid)\n\nNow, we need to find the molar masses of the reactants and product:\n\nSalicylic acid (C7H6O3): (7 x 12.01) + (6 x 1.01) + (3 x 16.00) = 138.12 g/mol\nAcetic anhydride (C4H6O3): (4 x 12.01) + (6 x 1.01) + (3 x 16.00) = 102.09 g/mol\nAcetylsalicylic acid (C9H8O4): (9 x 12.01) + (8 x 1.01) + (4 x 16.00) = 180.16 g/mol\n\nNow, we need to determine the limiting reactant. We will do this by calculating the moles of each reactant and comparing their mole ratios:\n\nMoles of salicylic acid = 12 g / 138.12 g/mol = 0.0868 mol\nMoles of acetic anhydride = 20 g / 102.09 g/mol = 0.1959 mol\n\nSince the mole ratio of salicylic acid to acetic anhydride in the balanced equation is 1:1, salicylic acid is the limiting reactant because it has fewer moles.\n\nNow, we can calculate the moles of acetylsalicylic acid that can be synthesized:\n\nMoles of acetylsalicylic acid = 0.0868 mol (since the mole ratio is 1:1)\n\nFinally, we can convert the moles of acetylsalicylic acid to grams:\n\nMass of acetylsalicylic acid = 0.0868 mol x 180.16 g/mol = 15.63 g\n\nTherefore, 15.63 grams of acetylsalicylic acid can be synthesized from 12 grams of salicylic acid and 20 grams of acetic anhydride."
