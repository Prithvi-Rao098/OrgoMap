    "message_2": "The nitrate ion (NO3⁻) has three resonance structures. In each of these structures, the nitrogen atom is at the center, and the three oxygen atoms are bonded to it. The nitrogen atom has a formal charge of +1, and one of the oxygen atoms has a formal charge of -1, while the other two oxygen atoms have a formal charge of 0. The overall charge of the ion is -1.\n\nResonance structures of the nitrate ion (NO3⁻) are as follows:\n\n1. Structure 1: Nitrogen is double-bonded to one oxygen atom (O1) and single-bonded to the other two oxygen atoms (O2 and O3). The double-bonded oxygen atom (O1) has a formal charge of 0, and the single-bonded oxygen atoms (O2 and O3) have a formal charge of -1.\n\n2. Structure 2: Nitrogen is double-bonded to the second oxygen atom (O2) and single-bonded to the other two oxygen atoms (O1 and O3). The double-bonded oxygen atom (O2) has a formal charge of 0, and the single-bonded oxygen atoms (O1 and O3) have a formal charge of -1.\n\n3. Structure 3: Nitrogen is double-bonded to the third oxygen atom (O3) and single-bonded to the other two oxygen atoms (O1 and O2). The double-bonded oxygen atom (O3) has a formal charge of 0, and the single-bonded oxygen atoms (O1 and O2) have a formal charge of -1.\n\nThese resonance structures explain why all three oxygen atoms form equal bonds with the nitrogen atom. In reality, the nitrate ion does not exist as any single resonance structure but rather as a hybrid of all three structures. The electrons in the double bond are delocalized among the three oxygen atoms, resulting in a bond order of 4/3 (1.33) for each N-O bond. This means that each N-O bond is somewhere between a single bond and a double bond, making them equal in strength and length. This delocalization of electrons and equal bond character is a result of the resonance phenomenon in the nitrate ion."
