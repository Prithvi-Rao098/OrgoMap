    "message_2": "The thermal decomposition of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) produces calcium oxide (CaO) and carbon dioxide (CO2). The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nCaCO3(s) â†’ CaO(s) + CO2(g)\n\nTo calculate the mass of CaO produced from 5.0 g of CaCO3, we need to use stoichiometry. First, we need to find the molar mass of CaCO3 and CaO.\n\nMolar mass of CaCO3 = 40.08 (Ca) + 12.01 (C) + 3 * 16.00 (O) = 100.09 g/mol\nMolar mass of CaO = 40.08 (Ca) + 16.00 (O) = 56.08 g/mol\n\nNow, we can use the balanced equation to find the stoichiometric ratio between CaCO3 and CaO, which is 1:1. \n\nNext, we need to convert the mass of CaCO3 to moles:\n\nmoles of CaCO3 = mass of CaCO3 / molar mass of CaCO3\nmoles of CaCO3 = 5.0 g / 100.09 g/mol = 0.0499 mol\n\nSince the stoichiometric ratio between CaCO3 and CaO is 1:1, the moles of CaO produced will be equal to the moles of CaCO3:\n\nmoles of CaO = 0.0499 mol\n\nNow, we can convert the moles of CaO to mass:\n\nmass of CaO = moles of CaO * molar mass of CaO\nmass of CaO = 0.0499 mol * 56.08 g/mol = 2.80 g\n\nSo, 2.80 g of CaO will be produced from the thermal decomposition of 5.0 g of CaCO3."
