    "message_2": "The color of the copper(II) sulfate aqueous solution and the solid copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO4·5H2O) is blue. Both of these compounds exhibit a blue color due to the presence of the copper(II) ion (Cu²⁺) in the complex.\n\nThe blue color arises from the electronic transitions within the d-orbitals of the copper(II) ion. In the copper(II) sulfate complex, the copper(II) ion has a d9 electronic configuration. When white light (which contains all colors of visible light) passes through the solution or reflects off the solid, the copper(II) ion absorbs some of the light in the red region of the spectrum. This absorption corresponds to the electronic transition of an electron from a lower energy d-orbital to a higher energy d-orbital.\n\nSince the red light is absorbed, the complementary color, blue, is transmitted or reflected, and that is the color we perceive. This phenomenon is known as the ligand field theory or crystal field theory, which explains the color of transition metal complexes based on the interaction between the metal ion and the surrounding ligands (in this case, sulfate and water molecules)."
