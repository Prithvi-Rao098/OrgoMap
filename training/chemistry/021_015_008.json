    "message_2": "The molecular geometry of the carbon dioxide (CO2) molecule is linear. In CO2, the carbon atom is in the center, forming double bonds with each of the two oxygen atoms. The bond angle between the oxygen-carbon-oxygen atoms is 180 degrees, resulting in a linear molecular geometry."
