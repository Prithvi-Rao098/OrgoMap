    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the fusion reaction, we need to consider the following steps:\n\n1. Melting the ice at 0°C\n2. Heating the melted ice (now water) from 0°C to the final temperature\n3. Cooling the liquid water from 25°C to the final temperature\n\nFirst, let's find the moles of ice and water:\n\nMolar mass of water (H2O) = 18.015 g/mol\n\nMoles of ice = (50 g) / (18.015 g/mol) = 2.776 mol\nMoles of water = (450 g) / (18.015 g/mol) = 24.986 mol\n\nStep 1: Melting the ice at 0°C\nEnthalpy change for melting ice = moles of ice × molar enthalpy of fusion\nΔH1 = 2.776 mol × 6.01 kJ/mol = 16.68 kJ\n\nStep 2: Heating the melted ice (now water) from 0°C to the final temperature\nLet Tf be the final temperature.\nq2 = moles of melted ice × specific heat capacity of water × (Tf - 0°C)\nΔH2 = 2.776 mol × 4.18 J/g·°C × 18.015 g/mol × (Tf - 0°C)\n\nStep 3: Cooling the liquid water from 25°C to the final temperature\nq3 = moles of water × specific heat capacity of water × (Tf - 25°C)\nΔH3 = 24.986 mol × 4.18 J/g·°C × 18.015 g/mol × (Tf - 25°C)\n\nSince there are no heat losses to the surroundings, the heat gained by the ice must equal the heat lost by the water:\n\nΔH1 + ΔH2 = -ΔH3\n\n16.68 kJ + 2.776 mol × 4.18 J/g·°C × 18.015 g/mol × (Tf - 0°C) = - (24.986 mol × 4.18 J/g·°C × 18.015 g/mol × (Tf - 25°C))\n\nNow, we need to solve for Tf:\n\n16.68 kJ × 1000 J/kJ + 2.776 × 4.18 × 18.015 × Tf = 24.986 × 4.18 × 18.015 × (Tf - 25)\n\n16680 J + 208.58 × Tf = 1874.16 × Tf - 1874.16 × 25\n\n16680 J = 1665.58 × Tf - 46854\n\nTf = (16680 + 46854) / 1665.58\nTf ≈ 32.1°C\n\nNow that we have the final temperature, we can calculate the enthalpy changes for steps 2 and 3:\n\nΔH2 = 2.776 mol × 4.18 J/g·°C × 18.015 g/mol × (32.1 - 0)\nΔH2 ≈ 208.58 × 32.1\nΔH2 ≈ 6695.5 J = 6.695 kJ\n\nΔH3 = 24.986 mol × 4.18 J/g·°C × 18.015 g/mol × (32.1 - 25)\nΔH3 ≈ 1874.16 × 7.1\nΔH3 ≈ -13307.5 J = -13.307 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the fusion reaction is the sum of the enthalpy changes for all three steps:\n\nΔH = ΔH1 + ΔH2 + ΔH3\nΔH = 16.68 kJ + 6.695 kJ - 13.307 kJ\nΔH ≈ 10.068 kJ"
