    "message_1": "What is the mechanism of nucleophilic substitution reaction for 1-bromobutane with potassium hydroxide in ethanol? Write the balanced chemical equation and label the nucleophile, leaving group, substrate, and product. Also, explain the stereochemistry of the reaction and classify it as either S​N1​ or S​N2​.",
    "message_2": "The mechanism of the nucleophilic substitution reaction for 1-bromobutane with potassium hydroxide in ethanol is an S​N2​ reaction. In an S​N2​ reaction, the nucleophile attacks the substrate from the opposite side of the leaving group, leading to an inversion of stereochemistry at the reaction center.\n\nBalanced chemical equation:\n\nC4H9Br + KOH → C4H9OH + KBr\n\nLabeling the components:\n- Nucleophile: Hydroxide ion (OH⁻) from potassium hydroxide (KOH)\n- Leaving group: Bromide ion (Br⁻) from 1-bromobutane (C4H9Br)\n- Substrate: 1-bromobutane (C4H9Br)\n- Product: 1-butanol (C4H9OH)\n\nStereochemistry:\nSince this is an S​N2​ reaction, the stereochemistry at the carbon atom attached to the leaving group (bromine) will be inverted. If the starting material is R-1-bromobutane, the product will be S-1-butanol, and vice versa.\n\nClassification:\nThis reaction is classified as an S​N2​ (Substitution Nucleophilic Bimolecular) reaction because the nucleophile (OH⁻) attacks the substrate (1-bromobutane) at the same time the leaving group (Br⁻) departs. The reaction rate depends on the concentration of both the substrate and the nucleophile, and it occurs in a single concerted step."
