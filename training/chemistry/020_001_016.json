    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction, we can use the expression:\n\nKc = [N2O4] / [NO2]^2\n\nGiven the equilibrium concentrations of NO2 and N2O4:\n\n[NO2] = 0.50 M\n[N2O4] = 0.20 M\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Kc expression:\n\nKc = (0.20) / (0.50)^2\nKc = 0.20 / 0.25\nKc = 0.8\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction is 0.8."
