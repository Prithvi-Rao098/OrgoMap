    "message_2": "To find the wavelength of the gamma-ray photon, we can use the Planck's equation:\n\nE = h * c / λ\n\nwhere E is the energy of the photon, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and λ is the wavelength of the photon.\n\nWe are given the energy E = 2.10 MeV. We need to convert this energy to Joules:\n\n1 MeV = 1 x 10^6 eV, and 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J\n\nSo, 2.10 MeV = 2.10 x 10^6 eV * 1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV = 3.3642 x 10^-13 J\n\nNow we can solve for the wavelength λ:\n\nλ = h * c / E = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (3.3642 x 10^-13 J)\n\nλ ≈ 5.91 x 10^-12 m\n\nSo, the energy of the gamma-ray photon is 2.10 MeV (or 3.3642 x 10^-13 J), and its wavelength is approximately 5.91 x 10^-12 m."
