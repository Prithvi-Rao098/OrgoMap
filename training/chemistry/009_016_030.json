    "message_2": "To determine the nuclide responsible for the 1.33 MeV gamma ray emission, we can consult a gamma ray energy database or a nuclide chart. One such database is the Evaluated Nuclear Structure Data File (ENSDF) maintained by the National Nuclear Data Center (NNDC). \n\nUpon searching the database for gamma ray energies close to 1.33 MeV, we find that the most likely candidate for the nuclide responsible for this energy signature is Cobalt-60 (60Co). Cobalt-60 is a well-known radioactive isotope that decays by beta decay to Nickel-60 (60Ni) and emits gamma rays with energies of 1.17 MeV and 1.33 MeV. \n\nIt is important to note that there may be other less common nuclides with gamma ray emissions around 1.33 MeV, but Cobalt-60 is the most likely candidate based on its prevalence and well-documented gamma ray signature."
