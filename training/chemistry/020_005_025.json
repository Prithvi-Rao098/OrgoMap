    "message_1": "A chemistry student needs to determine the effect of adding more reactant or product on the equilibrium position of the reaction: \n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) â‡Œ 2NH3(g)\n\nIf the student adds more N2 or NH3 to the reaction mixture, how will the equilibrium position change? and how will the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction be affected?",
    "message_2": "If the student adds more N2 (reactant) to the reaction mixture, the equilibrium position will shift to the right, favoring the formation of NH3 (product). This is in accordance with Le Chatelier's principle, which states that if a stress is applied to a system at equilibrium, the system will adjust to counteract the stress and re-establish equilibrium. In this case, the stress is the increased concentration of N2, and the system will respond by consuming more N2 and producing more NH3.\n\nOn the other hand, if the student adds more NH3 (product) to the reaction mixture, the equilibrium position will shift to the left, favoring the formation of N2 and H2 (reactants). This is also in accordance with Le Chatelier's principle, as the stress is the increased concentration of NH3, and the system will respond by consuming more NH3 and producing more N2 and H2.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction will not be affected by these changes in concentration. The equilibrium constant is a characteristic of the reaction and depends only on temperature. While the equilibrium position may shift in response to changes in concentration, the value of Kc remains constant."
