    "message_2": "To calculate the bond dissociation energy for the C-H bond in methane, we can use the following combustion reaction:\n\nCH4 (g) + 2 O2 (g) → CO2 (g) + 2 H2O (l)\n\nThe heat of combustion of methane is -890 kJ/mol, which is the enthalpy change for this reaction. We can use Hess's Law to determine the bond dissociation energy. First, we need to find the enthalpy of formation of methane (ΔHf°(CH4)).\n\nWe know the enthalpy of formation of CO2 and H2O, and the heat of combustion of hydrogen. We can use these values to find the enthalpy of formation of methane using the following equation:\n\nΔHc°(CH4) = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants)\n\n-890 kJ/mol = [ΔHf°(CO2) + 2ΔHf°(H2O)] - [ΔHf°(CH4) + 2ΔHf°(O2)]\n\nSince the enthalpy of formation of O2 is zero (it is in its standard state), the equation becomes:\n\n-890 kJ/mol = [-393.5 kJ/mol + 2(-285.8 kJ/mol)] - ΔHf°(CH4)\n\nNow, we can solve for the enthalpy of formation of methane:\n\nΔHf°(CH4) = -393.5 kJ/mol - 2(-285.8 kJ/mol) + 890 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(CH4) = -393.5 + 571.6 + 890\nΔHf°(CH4) = 1068.1 kJ/mol\n\nNow that we have the enthalpy of formation of methane, we can calculate the bond dissociation energy for the C-H bond. Methane has four C-H bonds, so we can write the following equation:\n\nΔHf°(CH4) = 4 * Bond dissociation energy (C-H)\n\nNow, we can solve for the bond dissociation energy:\n\nBond dissociation energy (C-H) = ΔHf°(CH4) / 4\nBond dissociation energy (C-H) = 1068.1 kJ/mol / 4\nBond dissociation energy (C-H) ≈ 267.03 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the bond dissociation energy for the C-H bond in methane is approximately 267.03 kJ/mol."
