    "message_2": "An E1 elimination reaction involves the formation of a carbocation intermediate, followed by the removal of a proton from an adjacent carbon to form a double bond. In this case, the starting material is 2-bromo-2-methylpropane, and the solvent is ethanol. The products formed will be an alkene and a hydrogen bromide (HBr). Here's the step-by-step mechanism for the reaction:\n\n1. Ionization: The 2-bromo-2-methylpropane molecule ionizes, with the bromide ion (Br-) leaving as a leaving group. This results in the formation of a carbocation intermediate, specifically a tertiary carbocation, at the 2-position of the propane molecule.\n\n2-bromo-2-methylpropane → [2-methylpropyl]+ + Br-\n\n2. Proton removal: A molecule of ethanol (acting as a weak base) abstracts a proton from an adjacent carbon to the carbocation center. In this case, the only available carbon is the one next to the carbocation center (the 1-position). This results in the formation of a double bond between the 1- and 2-positions of the propane molecule, creating an alkene.\n\n[2-methylpropyl]+ + EtOH → 2-methylpropene + EtOH2+\n\n3. Deprotonation: The ethanol molecule that gained a proton in the previous step loses it to a nearby ethanol molecule, regenerating the ethanol solvent and forming a hydrogen bromide (HBr) molecule.\n\nEtOH2+ + EtOH → 2 EtOH + HBr\n\nThe final products of the E1 elimination reaction are 2-methylpropene (an alkene) and hydrogen bromide (HBr)."
