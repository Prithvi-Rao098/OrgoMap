    "message_2": "As an AI language model, I am unable to perform actual experiments or analyze physical samples. However, I can guide you through the process of using mass spectrometry to identify an unknown compound.\n\n1. Prepare the sample: First, you need to prepare the unknown compound for mass spectrometry analysis. This may involve dissolving the compound in a suitable solvent, or using a technique like electrospray ionization (ESI) or matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) to ionize the sample.\n\n2. Run the mass spectrometer: Inject the prepared sample into the mass spectrometer. The instrument will ionize the molecules, separate them based on their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z), and record the intensity of each ion.\n\n3. Analyze the mass spectrum: The mass spectrum is a plot of ion intensity versus m/z. Look for the molecular ion peak (M+), which corresponds to the molecular weight of the compound. This peak is usually the highest mass peak in the spectrum, but it may not always be the most intense.\n\n4. Compare with known compounds: Search a database of known compounds to find any with a similar molecular weight to your unknown compound. You can use databases like the NIST Mass Spectral Library or ChemSpider.\n\n5. Identify functional groups: Examine the fragmentation pattern of the mass spectrum to identify characteristic peaks that may indicate the presence of specific functional groups. For example, a peak at m/z 29 may indicate an ethyl group, while a peak at m/z 91 may suggest a benzene ring.\n\n6. Confirm the identity: Based on the molecular weight and the presence of specific functional groups, you can propose a structure for the unknown compound. You may need to use additional techniques like infrared spectroscopy (IR) or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to confirm the structure.\n\nPlease note that without the actual mass spectrum data, I cannot provide you with the molecular weight and functional group of the unknown compound."
