    "message_2": "The standard enthalpy change for the formation of carbon dioxide (CO2) from its elements can be calculated using the given standard enthalpies of formation. The balanced chemical equation for the formation of CO2 is:\n\nC (s) + O2 (g) → CO2 (g)\n\nSince the standard enthalpies of formation for carbon (C) and oxygen (O2) are both 0 kJ/mol, the standard enthalpy change for the formation of CO2 is equal to the standard enthalpy of formation for CO2 itself:\n\nΔHf°(CO2) = -393.5 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the formation of carbon dioxide (CO2) from its elements is -393.5 kJ/mol."
