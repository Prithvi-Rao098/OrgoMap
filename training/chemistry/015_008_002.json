    "message_2": "Predicting the reactivity and selectivity of organic molecules under specific reaction conditions using quantum chemical calculations involves several steps and computational methods. Here's a general outline of the process:\n\n1. Choose an appropriate quantum chemical method: Select a suitable quantum chemical method, such as Density Functional Theory (DFT), ab initio methods (e.g., Hartree-Fock, MP2, CCSD(T)), or semi-empirical methods (e.g., AM1, PM3). The choice depends on the size of the molecule, the desired accuracy, and the available computational resources.\n\n2. Build the molecular model: Construct the molecular model of the reactants, intermediates, and products involved in the reaction. This includes specifying the atomic coordinates, bond lengths, and bond angles. You may use molecular modeling software to create and visualize the structures.\n\n3. Optimize the molecular geometry: Perform a geometry optimization to find the lowest energy conformations of the reactants, intermediates, and products. This step ensures that the molecules are in their most stable configurations before proceeding with the reaction calculations.\n\n4. Calculate the electronic properties: Using the optimized geometries, calculate the electronic properties of the molecules, such as the molecular orbitals, electron densities, and electrostatic potentials. These properties provide insight into the reactivity and selectivity of the molecules.\n\n5. Determine the reaction pathway: Identify the most likely reaction pathway by analyzing the electronic properties and comparing them to known reaction mechanisms. This may involve calculating transition states, reaction barriers, and reaction energies.\n\n6. Calculate the reaction rate constants: Using the reaction pathway information, calculate the reaction rate constants for each step in the reaction. This can be done using transition state theory or other kinetic models.\n\n7. Evaluate the selectivity: Analyze the reaction rate constants and the relative energies of the products to determine the selectivity of the reaction. This will help you understand which products are more likely to form under the given reaction conditions.\n\n8. Validate the predictions: Compare the predicted reactivity and selectivity with experimental data, if available. This will help you assess the accuracy of the quantum chemical calculations and refine the computational method if necessary.\n\nBy following these steps, you can use quantum chemical calculations to predict the reactivity and selectivity of organic molecules under specific reaction conditions. Keep in mind that the accuracy of the predictions depends on the chosen computational method, the quality of the molecular models, and the availability of experimental data for validation."
