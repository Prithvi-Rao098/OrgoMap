    "message_2": "To calculate the formal charge of the nitrogen atom in HCN, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the number of valence electrons for nitrogen. Nitrogen is in group 15, so it has 5 valence electrons.\n\n2. Calculate the number of non-bonding (lone pair) electrons on nitrogen. In HCN, nitrogen has no lone pairs.\n\n3. Calculate the number of bonding electrons. Nitrogen forms a triple bond with carbon in HCN, which means it shares 6 electrons (3 pairs) in the bond.\n\n4. Divide the number of bonding electrons by 2. This is because each bond consists of 2 electrons. In this case, 6 bonding electrons / 2 = 3.\n\n5. Subtract the number of non-bonding electrons and half the number of bonding electrons from the total number of valence electrons. In this case, the formal charge of nitrogen is 5 (valence electrons) - 0 (non-bonding electrons) - 3 (half of bonding electrons) = 2.\n\nSo, the formal charge of the nitrogen atom in HCN is +2."
