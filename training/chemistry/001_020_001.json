    "message_2": "The electrophilic addition reaction between propene (C3H6) and hydrogen bromide (HBr) will form 2-bromopropane (C3H7Br) as the major product. \n\nThe reaction proceeds as follows:\nC3H6 + HBr â†’ C3H7Br (2-bromopropane)\n\nIn this reaction, the double bond in propene acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic hydrogen atom in HBr. This leads to the formation of a carbocation intermediate, which is more stable at the secondary carbon due to hyperconjugation. The bromide ion (Br-) then attacks the carbocation, resulting in the formation of 2-bromopropane."
