    "message_2": "The addition of detergents to water significantly reduces the surface tension of water. This occurs due to the amphiphilic nature of detergent molecules, which means they have both hydrophilic (water-loving) and hydrophobic (water-repelling) parts.\n\nIn water, detergent molecules arrange themselves at the air-water interface with their hydrophilic heads facing the water and their hydrophobic tails facing the air. This arrangement disrupts the hydrogen bonding between water molecules at the surface, which is responsible for the high surface tension of water.\n\nBy reducing the surface tension, detergents allow water to spread more easily and penetrate into small spaces, such as the fibers of fabrics or the tiny crevices in dirty surfaces. This improved wetting ability enhances the cleaning action of water, as it can more effectively dissolve and remove dirt, grease, and other contaminants.\n\nIn summary, the addition of detergents to water reduces the surface tension due to the amphiphilic nature of detergent molecules, which disrupt the hydrogen bonding between water molecules at the surface. This results in improved wetting and cleaning properties of the water-detergent mixture."
