    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of energy required to melt the ice, we can use the formula:\n\nEnergy (Q) = mass (m) × heat of fusion (L)\n\nwhere:\n- Q is the energy required in Joules\n- m is the mass of the ice in grams\n- L is the heat of fusion of water in J/g\n\nGiven that the mass of the ice is 15 grams and the heat of fusion of water is 334 J/g, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nQ = 15 g × 334 J/g\n\nQ = 5010 J\n\nTherefore, 5010 Joules of energy are required to melt 15 grams of ice at 0°C."
