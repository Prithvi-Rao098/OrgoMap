The standard reduction potential of the copper ion is +0.34 V.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) for the electrochemical reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG° = -nFE°\n\nwhere:\nΔG° is the standard Gibbs free energy change,\nn is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction,\nF is the Faraday constant (approximately 96,485 C/mol),\nE° is the standard reduction potential.\n\nFor the reduction of copper ions (Cu²⁺) to copper atoms (Cu), the balanced half-reaction is:\n\nCu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu\n\nFrom the balanced half-reaction, we can see that n = 2 (two electrons are transferred). The standard reduction potential E° is given as +0.34 V.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔG° = - (2 mol e⁻) (96,485 C/mol e⁻) (0.34 V)\n\nΔG° = - (2) (96,485) (0.34)\n\nΔG° = - 65,609.8 J/mol\n\nSince the value is in Joules, we can convert it to kJ/mol:\n\nΔG° = -65.61 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard Gibbs free energy change for the reduction of copper ions to copper atoms using a copper electrode in a solution of copper sulfate at 25°C is -65.61 kJ/mol."
