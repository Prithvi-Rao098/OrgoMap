    "message_2": "The bond enthalpy of a carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond is approximately 413 kJ/mol.\n\nTo calculate the bond enthalpy of methane (CH4), we will consider the C-H bonds only, as there are no C-C or H-H bonds in methane. Methane has four C-H bonds, so we will multiply the bond enthalpy of a single C-H bond by the number of bonds in methane.\n\nBond enthalpy of CH4 = (Bond enthalpy of C-H) × (Number of C-H bonds)\nBond enthalpy of CH4 = (413 kJ/mol) × (4)\nBond enthalpy of CH4 = 1652 kJ/mol\n\nThe calculated bond enthalpy of methane is 1652 kJ/mol. However, this value is an approximation, as it is based on average bond enthalpy values. The experimental value for the bond enthalpy of methane is around 1660 kJ/mol. The calculated value is close to the experimental value, but there might be a small difference due to various factors such as the specific conditions under which the experimental value was determined."
