    "message_2": "The bond order of a molecule is calculated as the difference between the number of bonding electrons and the number of antibonding electrons, divided by 2. \n\nFor the neutral molecule NO, the electron configuration is:\nN (1s²2s²2p³) + O (1s²2s²2p⁴) = 1s²2s²2p¹0³\n\nThe molecular orbital configuration for NO is:\nσ1s², σ*1s², σ2s², σ*2s², π2p⁴, σ2p²\n\nThere are 10 bonding electrons (2 in σ1s, 2 in σ2s, 4 in π2p, and 2 in σ2p) and 4 antibonding electrons (2 in σ*1s and 2 in σ*2s). \n\nBond order of NO = (10 - 4) / 2 = 3\n\nFor the molecule NO+, one electron is removed, and the electron configuration becomes:\nσ1s², σ*1s², σ2s², σ*2s², π2p⁴, σ2p¹\n\nThere are 9 bonding electrons (2 in σ1s, 2 in σ2s, 4 in π2p, and 1 in σ2p) and 4 antibonding electrons (2 in σ*1s and 2 in σ*2s).\n\nBond order of NO+ = (9 - 4) / 2 = 2.5\n\nThe bond order of NO+ (2.5) is lower than the bond order of the neutral molecule NO (3), which means that the NO+ molecule has a weaker bond compared to the neutral NO molecule."
