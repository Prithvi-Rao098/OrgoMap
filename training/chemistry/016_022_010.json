    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the isomerization of 2-butene to 1-butene at constant pressure, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH = ΔHf (products) - ΔHf (reactants)\n\nIn this case, the reactant is 2-butene and the product is 1-butene. The standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) for 2-butene is -118.0 kJ/mol and for 1-butene is -133.9 kJ/mol.\n\nΔH = (-133.9 kJ/mol) - (-118.0 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH = -133.9 + 118.0\n\nΔH = -15.9 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change for the isomerization of 2-butene to 1-butene at constant pressure is -15.9 kJ/mol."
