    "message_2": "The balanced equation for the oxidation of ethanol (C2H5OH) to ethanoic acid (CH3COOH) using acidified potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7) is:\n\nC2H5OH + K2Cr2O7 + 4H2SO4 → CH3COOH + Cr2(SO4)3 + K2SO4 + 7H2O\n\nTo determine the number of moles of potassium dichromate required to completely oxidize 25 mL of 0.1 M ethanol, we first need to find the moles of ethanol:\n\nmoles of ethanol = volume × concentration\nmoles of ethanol = 0.025 L × 0.1 mol/L\nmoles of ethanol = 0.0025 mol\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of ethanol reacts with 1 mole of potassium dichromate. Therefore, the moles of potassium dichromate required are equal to the moles of ethanol:\n\nmoles of potassium dichromate = 0.0025 mol\n\nSo, 0.0025 moles of potassium dichromate are required to completely oxidize 25 mL of 0.1 M ethanol."
