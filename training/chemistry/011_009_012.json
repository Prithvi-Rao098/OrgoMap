    "message_2": "To determine the wavelength of the photon absorbed by a molecule of benzene during the HOMO to LUMO transition, we need to calculate the energy difference between these two molecular orbitals. We can use quantum chemical calculations to obtain this energy difference.\n\nFirst, we need to perform a quantum chemical calculation on benzene using a suitable method and basis set, such as time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) or configuration interaction singles (CIS) with a basis set like 6-31G(d). These calculations will provide us with the energy difference between the HOMO and LUMO orbitals.\n\nOnce we have the energy difference (ΔE) between the HOMO and LUMO orbitals, we can use the Planck's equation to calculate the wavelength (λ) of the absorbed photon:\n\nΔE = h * c / λ\n\nWhere:\nΔE is the energy difference between HOMO and LUMO (in Joules)\nh is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js)\nc is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)\nλ is the wavelength of the absorbed photon (in meters)\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for λ:\n\nλ = h * c / ΔE\n\nAfter obtaining the energy difference from the quantum chemical calculations, plug the value into the equation and solve for λ. This will give you the wavelength of the photon absorbed by the benzene molecule during the HOMO to LUMO transition.\n\nPlease note that performing quantum chemical calculations requires specialized software and knowledge in computational chemistry."
