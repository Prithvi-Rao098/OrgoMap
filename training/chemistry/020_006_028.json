    "message_1": "A sample problem for a chemistry student to solve from the subtopic \"Calculating the effect of changing the temperature on the equilibrium constant\" could be: \n\nWhat would be the new equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction 2NOCl (g) ↔ 2NO (g) + Cl2 (g) at 400 K, if the initial equilibrium constant at 300 K is 2.50 x 10^-3? Given that the enthalpy change of the reaction (∆H) is -91.84 kJ/mol and the entropy change of the reaction (∆S) is -188.8 J/mol K.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Van't Hoff equation, which relates the change in temperature to the change in the equilibrium constant:\n\nln(K2/K1) = -∆H/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nWhere:\nK1 = initial equilibrium constant at T1 (300 K)\nK2 = new equilibrium constant at T2 (400 K)\n∆H = enthalpy change of the reaction (-91.84 kJ/mol)\nR = gas constant (8.314 J/mol K)\nT1 = initial temperature (300 K)\nT2 = new temperature (400 K)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the enthalpy change from kJ/mol to J/mol:\n\n∆H = -91.84 kJ/mol * (1000 J/1 kJ) = -91840 J/mol\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Van't Hoff equation:\n\nln(K2/2.50 x 10^-3) = -(-91840 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol K) * (1/400 K - 1/300 K)\n\nSolve for K2:\n\nln(K2/2.50 x 10^-3) = 91840 / 8.314 * (1/400 - 1/300)\nln(K2/2.50 x 10^-3) ≈ 11.04\n\nNow, we can find K2:\n\nK2 = 2.50 x 10^-3 * e^(11.04)\nK2 ≈ 0.075\n\nSo, the new equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction at 400 K is approximately 0.075."
