    "message_2": "To calculate the diffusion coefficient (D) of a solute in a solvent, we can use the Stokes-Einstein equation:\n\nD = kT / (6πηr)\n\nwhere:\n- D is the diffusion coefficient (cm²/s)\n- k is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10^-23 J/K)\n- T is the temperature in Kelvin (K)\n- η is the dynamic viscosity of the solvent (in this case, water) (Pa·s)\n- r is the radius of the solute molecule (m)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin:\n\nT = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\n\nNext, we need to find the dynamic viscosity of water at 25°C. According to the literature, the dynamic viscosity of water at 25°C is approximately 8.9 × 10^-4 Pa·s.\n\nNow, we need to find the radius of the solute molecule. We can use the following equation to estimate the radius based on the molecular weight (MW) of the solute:\n\nr = (3MW / (4πNρ))^(1/3)\n\nwhere:\n- r is the radius of the solute molecule (m)\n- MW is the molecular weight of the solute (g/mol)\n- N is Avogadro's number (6.022 × 10^23 mol^-1)\n- ρ is the density of the solute (g/cm³)\n\nSince we don't have the density of the solute, we cannot calculate the exact radius. However, the problem states that the diffusion rate is 1.5 × 10^-5 cm²/s. This value is already the diffusion coefficient (D) that we are looking for.\n\nTherefore, the diffusion coefficient of the solute in water at 25°C is:\n\nD = 1.5 × 10^-5 cm²/s"
