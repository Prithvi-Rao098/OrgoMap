    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 0.1 moles of sucrose, we can use the given enthalpy change of the reaction and the number of moles of sucrose.\n\nEnthalpy change (ΔH) = moles of sucrose × enthalpy change per mole\n\nGiven:\nMoles of sucrose = 0.1 moles\nEnthalpy change per mole = -564 kJ/mol (exothermic, so negative value)\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 0.1 moles of sucrose:\n\nΔH = 0.1 moles × (-564 kJ/mol)\nΔH = -56.4 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 0.1 moles of sucrose in water is -56.4 kJ."
