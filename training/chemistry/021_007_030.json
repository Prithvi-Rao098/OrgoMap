    "message_2": "To calculate the formal charge of the nitrogen (N) atom in ammonia (NH3), we can use the following formula:\n\nFormal charge = (Valence electrons of the atom) - (Non-bonding electrons) - (1/2 * Bonding electrons)\n\nFor nitrogen (N), the number of valence electrons is 5 (as it belongs to Group 15 in the periodic table). In ammonia, nitrogen forms 3 single bonds with 3 hydrogen atoms, which means there are 6 bonding electrons (2 electrons per bond). There are no non-bonding electrons on nitrogen in ammonia.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nFormal charge = (5) - (0) - (1/2 * 6)\nFormal charge = 5 - 0 - 3\nFormal charge = 2\n\nSo, the formal charge of the nitrogen (N) atom in ammonia (NH3) is 0."
