    "message_2": "The redox reaction between iodine (I2) and thiosulfate (S2O3^2-) in the presence of hydrochloric acid (HCl) can be represented by the following equation:\n\n2 S2O3^2- (aq) + I2 (aq) â†’ S4O6^2- (aq) + 2 I^- (aq)\n\nWhen the pH of the solution decreases, the concentration of H+ ions increases due to the presence of hydrochloric acid. This increase in H+ ions can affect the equilibrium position of the redox reaction.\n\nIn this reaction, iodine is reduced to iodide ions (I^-), and thiosulfate ions are oxidized to tetrathionate ions (S4O6^2-). The reaction is favored under acidic conditions, as the H+ ions help to stabilize the iodide ions (I^-) formed during the reaction.\n\nAs the pH decreases (i.e., the concentration of H+ ions increases), the equilibrium position of the redox reaction will shift to the right, favoring the formation of iodide ions (I^-) and tetrathionate ions (S4O6^2-). This is because the increased concentration of H+ ions stabilizes the iodide ions, driving the reaction forward.\n\nIn summary, decreasing the pH of the solution will shift the equilibrium position of the redox reaction between iodine and thiosulfate in the presence of hydrochloric acid to the right, favoring the formation of iodide ions and tetrathionate ions."
