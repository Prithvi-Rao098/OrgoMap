    "message_1": "What is the boiling point of iron (III) oxide (Fe2O3) in Kelvin scale if its melting point is 1,565 degrees Celsius? Assume that Fe2O3 has a standard molar entropy of 89.9 J/mol K.",
    "message_2": "To determine the boiling point of iron (III) oxide (Fe2O3), we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates the vapor pressure of a substance at different temperatures to its enthalpy of vaporization. However, the enthalpy of vaporization for Fe2O3 is not provided in the problem statement. \n\nAlternatively, we can try to find the boiling point of Fe2O3 using experimental data or reference materials. According to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, the boiling point of Fe2O3 is not well-defined, as it tends to decompose before boiling. However, some sources suggest that the boiling point of Fe2O3 is around 3,414 degrees Celsius.\n\nTo convert this value to the Kelvin scale, we can use the following equation:\n\nT(K) = T(Â°C) + 273.15\n\nT(K) = 3,414 + 273.15 = 3,687.15 K\n\nTherefore, the boiling point of iron (III) oxide (Fe2O3) is approximately 3,687.15 K. Keep in mind that this value is not well-defined due to the decomposition of Fe2O3 before boiling."
