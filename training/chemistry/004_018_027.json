    "message_1": "A chemist has a sample of an unknown compound with a mass of 5.00 g. After analyzing the sample, the following results were obtained: 0.50 g of oxygen, 1.25 g of carbon, and 3.25 g of hydrogen. Calculate the molecular formula of the unknown compound using mass balance calculations.",
    "message_2": "To determine the molecular formula of the unknown compound, we first need to find the empirical formula. The empirical formula is the simplest whole number ratio of the elements in the compound. \n\n1. Calculate the moles of each element in the compound:\nMoles of oxygen (O): \n0.50 g / 16.00 g/mol (molar mass of O) = 0.03125 mol\n\nMoles of carbon (C): \n1.25 g / 12.01 g/mol (molar mass of C) = 0.1041 mol\n\nMoles of hydrogen (H): \n3.25 g / 1.008 g/mol (molar mass of H) = 3.226 mol\n\n2. Divide each mole value by the smallest mole value to get the mole ratio:\nMole ratio of O: 0.03125 / 0.03125 = 1\nMole ratio of C: 0.1041 / 0.03125 = 3.33 ≈ 4 (round to the nearest whole number)\nMole ratio of H: 3.226 / 0.03125 = 103.23 ≈ 104 (round to the nearest whole number)\n\n3. Write the empirical formula based on the mole ratios:\nC₄H₁₀₄O\n\nNow, we need to find the molecular formula. The molecular formula is a multiple of the empirical formula. \n\n4. Calculate the molar mass of the empirical formula:\nC₄H₁₀₄O: (4 x 12.01) + (104 x 1.008) + (1 x 16.00) = 48.04 + 104.83 + 16.00 = 168.87 g/mol\n\n5. Divide the molar mass of the unknown compound by the molar mass of the empirical formula to find the multiple:\nSince we don't have the molar mass of the unknown compound, we cannot determine the exact molecular formula. However, we can express it as a multiple of the empirical formula:\n\nMolecular formula = (C₄H₁₀₄O)n\n\nwhere n is an integer representing the multiple of the empirical formula."
