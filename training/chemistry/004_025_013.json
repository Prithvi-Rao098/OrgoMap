    "message_2": "To determine the concentration of lead (Pb) in a drinking water sample using cyclic voltammetry, you will need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Prepare the drinking water sample: Collect a representative sample of the drinking water and filter it to remove any particulate matter that may interfere with the analysis.\n\n2. Prepare the standard solutions: Prepare a series of standard solutions containing known concentrations of lead (Pb) in the same matrix as the drinking water sample (e.g., deionized water). These standard solutions will be used to create a calibration curve.\n\n3. Set up the cyclic voltammetry instrument: Assemble the three-electrode system, which typically consists of a working electrode (e.g., a glassy carbon electrode), a reference electrode (e.g., a silver/silver chloride electrode), and a counter electrode (e.g., a platinum wire). Connect the electrodes to the potentiostat, which controls the voltage applied to the working electrode.\n\n4. Perform cyclic voltammetry on the standard solutions: Run the cyclic voltammetry experiment on each of the standard solutions, applying a potential sweep that covers the potential range where lead (Pb) reduction and oxidation occur. Record the peak current for each standard solution, which is proportional to the concentration of lead (Pb) in the solution.\n\n5. Create a calibration curve: Plot the peak current values against the known concentrations of lead (Pb) in the standard solutions. Perform a linear regression to obtain the calibration curve equation (e.g., y = mx + b, where y is the peak current, x is the concentration of lead, m is the slope, and b is the intercept).\n\n6. Perform cyclic voltammetry on the drinking water sample: Run the cyclic voltammetry experiment on the drinking water sample, applying the same potential sweep as used for the standard solutions. Record the peak current for the drinking water sample.\n\n7. Calculate the concentration of lead (Pb) in the drinking water sample: Using the calibration curve equation, solve for the concentration of lead (Pb) in the drinking water sample by substituting the peak current value obtained in step 6 into the equation.\n\nPlease note that this is a general outline of the procedure, and specific details may vary depending on the equipment and conditions used in the analysis."
