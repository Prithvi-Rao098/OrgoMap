    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat required to sublimate 10 grams of dry ice, we need to determine the number of moles of carbon dioxide and then use the heat of sublimation to find the total heat required.\n\nFirst, we need to find the molar mass of carbon dioxide (CO₂). The atomic masses of carbon (C) and oxygen (O) are approximately 12.01 g/mol and 16.00 g/mol, respectively.\n\nMolar mass of CO₂ = 12.01 g/mol (for C) + 2 * 16.00 g/mol (for O) = 12.01 + 32.00 = 44.01 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the number of moles of CO₂ in 10 grams of dry ice:\n\nmoles of CO₂ = mass of CO₂ / molar mass of CO₂\nmoles of CO₂ = 10 g / 44.01 g/mol ≈ 0.227 moles\n\nNext, we will use the heat of sublimation (25.2 kJ/mol) to calculate the amount of heat required to sublimate 0.227 moles of CO₂:\n\nHeat required = moles of CO₂ * heat of sublimation\nHeat required = 0.227 moles * 25.2 kJ/mol ≈ 5.72 kJ\n\nTherefore, approximately 5.72 kJ of heat is required to sublimate 10 grams of dry ice at a temperature of -78.5°C."
