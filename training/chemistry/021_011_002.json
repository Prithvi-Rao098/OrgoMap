    "message_2": "The bond dissociation energy is the energy required to break a specific chemical bond. In this case, we are looking for the energy required to break one carbon-hydrogen bond in methane (CH4). The given enthalpy change for the reaction CH4(g) → C(g) + 4H(g) is +1665 kJ/mol, which represents the energy required to break all four carbon-hydrogen bonds in one mole of methane.\n\nTo find the bond dissociation energy for one carbon-hydrogen bond, we need to divide the total enthalpy change by the number of bonds broken:\n\nBond dissociation energy (C-H) = (+1665 kJ/mol) / 4\n\nBond dissociation energy (C-H) = 416.25 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the bond dissociation energy of the carbon-hydrogen bond in methane is approximately 416.25 kJ/mol."
