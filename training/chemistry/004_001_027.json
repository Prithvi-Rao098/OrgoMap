    "message_2": "To find the concentration of hydrochloric acid (HCl) in the solution, we can use the concept of stoichiometry and the balanced chemical equation for the neutralization reaction between HCl and NaOH:\n\nHCl + NaOH → NaCl + H2O\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of HCl reacts with 1 mole of NaOH.\n\nWe are given that 50 mL of 0.1 M NaOH is required to neutralize the HCl solution. First, we need to find the moles of NaOH used in the reaction:\n\nmoles of NaOH = volume (L) × concentration (M)\nmoles of NaOH = 0.050 L × 0.1 M = 0.005 moles\n\nSince the mole ratio of HCl to NaOH is 1:1, the moles of HCl in the 100 mL solution will also be 0.005 moles.\n\nNow, we can find the concentration of HCl in the 100 mL solution:\n\nconcentration (M) = moles of HCl / volume (L)\nconcentration (M) = 0.005 moles / 0.100 L = 0.05 M\n\nSo, the concentration of hydrochloric acid (HCl) in the 100 mL solution is 0.05 M."
