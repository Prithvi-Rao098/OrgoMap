    "message_1": "What are the equilibrium concentration of CO2, H2O, CO and H2 when 0.2 mol of CO and 0.3 mol of H2 were allowed to react in a 1L container at a temperature of 500°C until equilibrium was reached and the equilibrium constant (Kc) was found to be 5.0? The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is CO(g) + H2(g) ⇌ CO2(g) + H2O(g).",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the initial concentrations of CO and H2, the balanced chemical equation, and the equilibrium constant (Kc) to find the equilibrium concentrations of CO2, H2O, CO, and H2.\n\nInitial concentrations:\nCO = 0.2 mol / 1L = 0.2 M\nH2 = 0.3 mol / 1L = 0.3 M\nCO2 = 0 M (since no CO2 is present initially)\nH2O = 0 M (since no H2O is present initially)\n\nLet x be the change in concentration of CO and H2 at equilibrium. Then, the change in concentration of CO2 and H2O will also be x.\n\nEquilibrium concentrations:\nCO = 0.2 - x M\nH2 = 0.3 - x M\nCO2 = x M\nH2O = x M\n\nNow, we can use the equilibrium constant (Kc) to set up an equation:\n\nKc = [CO2][H2O] / [CO][H2]\n5.0 = (x)(x) / (0.2 - x)(0.3 - x)\n\nTo solve for x, we can either use algebraic methods or a numerical method like the quadratic formula. In this case, we'll use the quadratic formula:\n\nx^2 = 5.0(0.2 - x)(0.3 - x)\nx^2 = (1 - 5x + 5x^2)\n\nRearranging the equation:\n\n4x^2 - 5x + 1 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\nx = (5 ± √(5^2 - 4(4)(1))) / (2(4))\n\nx ≈ 0.154 or x ≈ 1.616\n\nSince x cannot be greater than the initial concentrations of CO and H2, we discard the second solution (x ≈ 1.616). Therefore, x ≈ 0.154.\n\nNow, we can find the equilibrium concentrations:\n\nCO = 0.2 - x ≈ 0.2 - 0.154 ≈ 0.046 M\nH2 = 0.3 - x ≈ 0.3 - 0.154 ≈ 0.146 M\nCO2 = x ≈ 0.154 M\nH2O = x ≈ 0.154 M\n\nSo, the equilibrium concentrations are approximately:\nCO2: 0.154 M\nH2O: 0.154 M\nCO: 0.046 M\nH2: 0.146 M"
