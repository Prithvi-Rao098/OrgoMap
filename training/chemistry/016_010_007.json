The initial temperature of water was also 25°C and the final temperature after dissolution was 18.5°C. The molar mass of ammonium nitrate is 80.04 g/mol and the specific heat of water is 4.184 J/g°C. Assume that the heat capacity of the solution is the same as that of water.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change, we can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat absorbed or released, m is the mass of the substance, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nFirst, we need to find the mass of water. Since the density of water is approximately 1 g/mL, the mass of 250 mL of water is:\n\nm_water = 250 g\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat absorbed or released by the water:\n\nΔT = T_final - T_initial = 18.5°C - 25°C = -6.5°C\n\nq_water = m_water * c * ΔT = 250 g * 4.184 J/g°C * (-6.5°C) = -6806 J\n\nSince the heat absorbed by the water is negative, it means that the water lost heat to the ammonium nitrate. Therefore, the heat absorbed by the ammonium nitrate is:\n\nq_ammonium_nitrate = -q_water = 6806 J\n\nNow, we need to find the moles of ammonium nitrate:\n\nmoles_ammonium_nitrate = mass / molar_mass = 50.0 g / 80.04 g/mol = 0.6249 mol\n\nFinally, we can calculate the enthalpy change per mole of ammonium nitrate:\n\nΔH = q_ammonium_nitrate / moles_ammonium_nitrate = 6806 J / 0.6249 mol = 10887 J/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change when 50.0 grams of ammonium nitrate dissolves in 250 mL of water at 25°C is approximately 10.9 kJ/mol."
