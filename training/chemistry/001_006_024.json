    "message_2": "To distinguish between alkynes and alkenes using a simple chemical test, you can use the Bromine water test (also known as the Bromine test). This test relies on the reaction of bromine with the carbon-carbon double bond in alkenes and the carbon-carbon triple bond in alkynes.\n\nHere's how to perform the Bromine water test:\n\n1. Prepare a solution of bromine water by dissolving a small amount of bromine in water. The solution should have a reddish-brown color.\n\n2. Take two test tubes, and add a small amount of the alkene in one test tube and the alkyne in the other test tube.\n\n3. Add a few drops of the bromine water solution to each test tube.\n\n4. Observe the color change in each test tube.\n\nResults:\n\n- If the compound is an alkene, the reddish-brown color of the bromine water will disappear or significantly fade, indicating the addition of bromine across the carbon-carbon double bond (addition reaction). This is a positive test for alkenes.\n\n- If the compound is an alkyne, the reddish-brown color of the bromine water will either not change or change very slowly, indicating that the reaction with the carbon-carbon triple bond is much slower and less reactive than with the double bond. This is a negative test for alkenes, suggesting the presence of an alkyne.\n\nThis test allows you to distinguish between alkynes and alkenes based on their reactivity with bromine water."
