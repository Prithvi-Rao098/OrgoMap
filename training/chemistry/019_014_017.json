    "message_1": "Calculate the standard enthalpy change for the precipitation reaction of copper(II) sulfate and sodium hydroxide, given the following balanced chemical equation:\n\nCuSO4(aq) + 2NaOH(aq) → Cu(OH)2(s) + Na2SO4(aq)\n\nAssume the reaction takes place under standard conditions and the necessary species are present in their standard states. Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction, we need the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) for each species involved in the reaction. The standard enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a substance is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states.\n\nThe standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) for the species involved in the reaction are as follows:\n\nCuSO4(aq): -769.98 kJ/mol\nNaOH(aq): -469.15 kJ/mol\nCu(OH)2(s): -1004.45 kJ/mol\nNa2SO4(aq): -1373.63 kJ/mol\n\nUsing these values, we can calculate the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the reaction using the following equation:\n\nΔH° = [Σ (ΔHf° products) - Σ (ΔHf° reactants)]\n\nΔH° = [(1 mol × -1004.45 kJ/mol) + (1 mol × -1373.63 kJ/mol)] - [(1 mol × -769.98 kJ/mol) + (2 mol × -469.15 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH° = (-1004.45 - 1373.63) - (-769.98 - 2 × 469.15)\n\nΔH° = (-2378.08) - (-1708.28)\n\nΔH° = -669.80 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the precipitation reaction of copper(II) sulfate and sodium hydroxide is -669.80 kJ/mol."
