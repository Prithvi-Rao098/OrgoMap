To find the electronegativity difference between the two atoms in a water molecule (H2O), subtract the electronegativity value of hydrogen from that of oxygen:\n\nElectronegativity difference = Electronegativity of oxygen - Electronegativity of hydrogen\nElectronegativity difference = 3.44 - 2.20\nElectronegativity difference â‰ˆ 1.24"
