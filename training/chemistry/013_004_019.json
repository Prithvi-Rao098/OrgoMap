    "message_2": "To calculate the surface area of the activated carbon sample using the BET theory, we need to determine the amount of gas adsorbed per unit mass of the sample and then use the BET equation to find the surface area. \n\nFirst, let's find the amount of gas adsorbed per unit mass of the sample:\n\nAmount of nitrogen gas adsorbed = 2.5 moles\nSample weight = 3 grams\nMolecular weight of nitrogen = 28 g/mol\n\nAmount of gas adsorbed per gram of sample = (2.5 moles) / (3 grams)\n= 0.833 moles/gram\n\nNow, we can use the BET equation to find the surface area. The BET equation is:\n\nV = (V_m * C * P) / [(P_0 - P) * (1 + (C - 1) * P / P_0)]\n\nWhere:\nV = volume of gas adsorbed at pressure P\nV_m = volume of gas adsorbed at monolayer coverage\nC = BET constant\nP = pressure of the gas\nP_0 = saturation pressure of the gas\n\nIn this problem, we are given the pressure (P) as 1 atm and the temperature (T) as 77 K. We need to find the saturation pressure (P_0) of nitrogen gas at 77 K. The saturation pressure can be found using the Antoine equation:\n\nlog(P_0) = A - (B / (T + C))\n\nFor nitrogen, the Antoine constants are:\nA = 6.89272\nB = 840.0\nC = 237.0\n\nLet's find P_0:\n\nlog(P_0) = 6.89272 - (840.0 / (77 + 237))\nP_0 = 10^(6.89272 - (840.0 / 314))\nP_0 ≈ 0.835 atm\n\nNow, we can use the BET equation to find V_m and C. However, we are not given the values of V_m and C in the problem. In practice, these values are determined experimentally by measuring the adsorption isotherm and fitting the BET equation to the data. Without these values, we cannot directly calculate the surface area using the BET equation.\n\nIf we had the values of V_m and C, we could calculate the surface area using the following equation:\n\nSurface area = (V_m * N_A * A_cross) / (molecular weight of nitrogen)\n\nWhere:\nN_A = Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23 molecules/mol)\nA_cross = cross-sectional area of a nitrogen molecule (0.162 nm²)\n\nUnfortunately, without the values of V_m and C, we cannot proceed further in calculating the surface area of the activated carbon sample using the BET theory."
