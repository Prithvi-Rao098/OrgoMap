    "message_2": "To find the electronegativity difference between chlorine (Cl) and sodium (Na) in sodium chloride (NaCl), we need to look at their respective electronegativity values on the Pauling scale.\n\nThe electronegativity of chlorine (Cl) is 3.16, and the electronegativity of sodium (Na) is 0.93.\n\nTo find the difference, subtract the electronegativity of sodium from that of chlorine:\n\nElectronegativity difference = Electronegativity of Cl - Electronegativity of Na\nElectronegativity difference = 3.16 - 0.93\nElectronegativity difference = 2.23\n\nThe electronegativity difference between chlorine and sodium in sodium chloride is 2.23."
