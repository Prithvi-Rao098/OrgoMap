    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kp) for the reaction between nitrogen gas (N2) and hydrogen gas (H2) to produce ammonia gas (NH3), we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g)\n\nNow, we can use the partial pressures of the gases at equilibrium to find the Kp value. The expression for Kp for this reaction is:\n\nKp = [NH3]^2 / ([N2] * [H2]^3)\n\nwhere [NH3], [N2], and [H2] represent the partial pressures of ammonia, nitrogen, and hydrogen, respectively, at equilibrium.\n\nGiven the partial pressures at equilibrium:\n[N2] = 1.75 atm\n[H2] = 3.20 atm\n[NH3] = 0.85 atm\n\nWe can now plug these values into the Kp expression:\n\nKp = (0.85)^2 / (1.75 * (3.20)^3)\n\nKp = 0.7225 / (1.75 * 32.768)\n\nKp = 0.7225 / 57.344\n\nKp ≈ 0.0126\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium constant (Kp) for the reaction between nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas to produce ammonia gas at 500 K is approximately 0.0126."
