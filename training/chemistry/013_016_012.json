    "message_2": "The presence of a catalyst in a heterogeneous catalyzed reaction significantly affects the rate of the reaction. A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without being consumed in the process. In a heterogeneous catalyzed reaction, the catalyst is in a different phase (solid, liquid, or gas) than the reactants.\n\nCatalysts work by providing an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy, which allows more reactant molecules to have sufficient energy to undergo the reaction. This results in an increased rate of reaction.\n\nExperimental evidence:\n\nOne classic example of a heterogeneous catalyzed reaction is the hydrogenation of ethene (C2H4) to form ethane (C2H6) in the presence of a solid catalyst, such as finely divided platinum or palladium.\n\nC2H4(g) + H2(g) â†’ C2H6(g)\n\nIn an experiment to demonstrate the effect of a catalyst on the rate of this reaction, two separate setups can be used. In both setups, a known amount of ethene and hydrogen gas is mixed in a closed container.\n\nSetup 1 (Control): No catalyst is added to the reaction mixture.\nSetup 2 (Experimental): A known amount of finely divided platinum or palladium catalyst is added to the reaction mixture.\n\nThe progress of the reaction can be monitored by measuring the decrease in pressure (due to the consumption of reactants) or the increase in pressure (due to the formation of products) over time.\n\nResults:\n\nIn the control setup (without a catalyst), the reaction rate is observed to be very slow, and it may take a long time for any significant change in pressure to be detected.\n\nIn the experimental setup (with a catalyst), the reaction rate is significantly faster, and a noticeable change in pressure can be observed within a much shorter time.\n\nThis experimental evidence supports the conclusion that the presence of a catalyst, such as platinum or palladium, significantly increases the rate of the heterogeneous catalyzed reaction between ethene and hydrogen. The catalyst provides an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy, allowing more reactant molecules to undergo the reaction and form products at a faster rate."
