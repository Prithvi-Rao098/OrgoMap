    "message_1": "What is the concentration of copper sulfate in a 50 mL solution if the absorbance measured by a spectrophotometer is found to be 0.450 at a wavelength of 450 nm? The molar absorptivity of copper sulfate at this wavelength is 9.6 x 10^3 L/mol.cm.",
    "message_2": "To find the concentration of copper sulfate in the solution, we can use the Beer-Lambert Law, which states:\n\nA = ε * c * l\n\nwhere A is the absorbance, ε is the molar absorptivity, c is the concentration of the solution, and l is the path length of the cuvette (in cm).\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nA = 0.450\nε = 9.6 x 10^3 L/mol.cm\nl = 1 cm (assuming a standard cuvette)\n\nWe need to solve for c (the concentration of the solution):\n\n0.450 = (9.6 x 10^3 L/mol.cm) * c * 1 cm\n\nNow, we can isolate c:\n\nc = 0.450 / (9.6 x 10^3 L/mol.cm)\n\nc ≈ 4.69 x 10^-5 mol/L\n\nSo, the concentration of copper sulfate in the 50 mL solution is approximately 4.69 x 10^-5 mol/L."
