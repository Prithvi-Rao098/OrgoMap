    "message_2": "To find the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid with a dissociation constant (Ka) of 1.8 x 10^-5, we can use the formula:\n\nKa = [H+][A-]/[HA]\n\nWhere [H+] is the concentration of hydrogen ions, [A-] is the concentration of acetate ions, and [HA] is the concentration of acetic acid.\n\nSince we are assuming complete dissociation of acetic acid, the concentration of hydrogen ions [H+] will be equal to the concentration of acetate ions [A-]. Let's call this concentration x.\n\nKa = x^2 / (0.1 - x)\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 = x^2 / (0.1 - x)\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx^2 + 1.8 x 10^-5 * x - 1.8 x 10^-5 * 0.1 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can use the quadratic formula to solve for x:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 1.8 x 10^-5, and c = -1.8 x 10^-5 * 0.1.\n\nx = (-1.8 x 10^-5 ± √((1.8 x 10^-5)^2 - 4 * 1 * -1.8 x 10^-5 * 0.1)) / 2\n\nx ≈ 1.34 x 10^-3\n\nNow that we have the concentration of hydrogen ions [H+], we can find the pH using the formula:\n\npH = -log10[H+]\n\npH = -log10(1.34 x 10^-3)\n\npH ≈ 2.87\n\nSo the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid with a dissociation constant (Ka) of 1.8 x 10^-5 is approximately 2.87."
