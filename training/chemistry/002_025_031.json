    "message_2": "Fe(CO)₅, also known as iron pentacarbonyl, is a complex molecule with an iron atom (Fe) surrounded by five carbonyl (CO) ligands. To determine the magnetic moment of Fe(CO)₅, we first need to identify the electron configuration of the central iron atom.\n\nIron has an atomic number of 26, which means it has 26 electrons in its ground state. The electron configuration for iron is [Ar] 3d^6 4s^2. However, in Fe(CO)₅, the iron atom is in a lower oxidation state due to the presence of the carbonyl ligands. The electron configuration of Fe in Fe(CO)₅ is [Ar] 3d^8, as it loses the 4s electrons and gains two electrons from the carbonyl ligands.\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic moment (μ) using the formula:\n\nμ = √(n(n+2))\n\nwhere n is the number of unpaired electrons. In the 3d^8 configuration, there are two unpaired electrons. Therefore, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nμ = √(2(2+2))\nμ = √(2(4))\nμ = √8\n\nThe magnetic moment of Fe(CO)₅ in the gas phase is √8 Bohr magnetons.\n\nThe electron configuration of Fe(CO)₅ is [Ar] 3d^8, with two unpaired electrons in the 3d orbitals."
