    "message_2": "To calculate the rate constant (k) for the reaction A + B → C, we can use the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk = Ae^(-Ea/RT)\n\nwhere:\nk = rate constant\nA = pre-exponential factor (also known as the frequency factor)\nEa = activation energy (50 kJ/mol)\nR = gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\nT = temperature (300 K)\n\nHowever, we do not have the value of the pre-exponential factor (A) in the given information. Therefore, we cannot calculate the exact value of the rate constant (k) for this reaction.\n\nAs for predicting the order of the reaction based on the proposed mechanism, we need more information about the reaction mechanism, such as the elementary steps and their molecularity. The overall order of the reaction is determined by adding the molecularity of each elementary step in the rate-determining step (slowest step) of the mechanism. Without this information, we cannot predict the order of the reaction."
