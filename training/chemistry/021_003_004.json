    "message_2": "The predicted bond angle of a carbon dioxide molecule (CO2) based on its molecular structure and bonding arrangement is 180 degrees. This is because CO2 has a linear molecular geometry, with the carbon atom in the center and the two oxygen atoms on either side, forming a straight line."
