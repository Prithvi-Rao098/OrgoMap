    "message_2": "The electrophilic addition reaction of propene with hydrogen halides (HX) involves a two-step mechanism. Here, I will describe the mechanism using HBr as an example, but the mechanism is similar for other hydrogen halides (HCl, HI, etc.).\n\nStep 1: Protonation of the alkene (formation of a carbocation)\nIn the first step, the alkene (propene) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic hydrogen atom of the hydrogen halide (HBr). This leads to the breaking of the H-Br bond, with the electrons from the bond moving to the bromine atom. As a result, a carbocation (positively charged carbon) intermediate is formed, and a bromide ion (Br-) is generated. In the case of propene, the carbocation is formed on the secondary carbon, which is more stable due to hyperconjugation.\n\nPropene + HBr -> [CH3-CH(+)-CH3] + Br-\n\nStep 2: Attack of the nucleophile (bromide ion) on the carbocation\nIn the second step, the bromide ion (Br-) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbocation formed in the first step. This leads to the formation of the product, 2-bromopropane.\n\n[CH3-CH(+)-CH3] + Br- -> CH3-CH(Br)-CH3\n\nOverall reaction:\nPropene + HBr -> 2-bromopropane\n\nIn summary, the electrophilic addition reaction of propene with hydrogen halides (HX) involves the protonation of the alkene to form a carbocation intermediate, followed by the attack of the halide ion on the carbocation to generate the final product."
