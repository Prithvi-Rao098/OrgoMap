    "message_2": "When aqueous solutions of potassium iodide (KI) and lead (II) nitrate (Pb(NO3)2) are combined, a double replacement reaction occurs. The final products formed are lead (II) iodide (PbI2) and potassium nitrate (KNO3).\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\n2 KI (aq) + Pb(NO3)2 (aq) â†’ 2 KNO3 (aq) + PbI2 (s)\n\nLead (II) iodide (PbI2) is a solid precipitate, while potassium nitrate (KNO3) remains in the aqueous solution."
