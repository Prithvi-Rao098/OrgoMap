    "message_2": "The major product obtained from the Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction of toluene with acetyl chloride in the presence of aluminum chloride as a catalyst is p-methylacetophenone (also known as para-methylacetophenone or 4'-methylacetophenone). In this reaction, the acetyl group from acetyl chloride is introduced to the para position of the toluene ring, forming the p-methylacetophenone."
