    "message_2": "To calculate the change in enthalpy (ΔH) for the reaction, we can use the bond dissociation energies given. The formula for this is:\n\nΔH = Σ (bond energies of reactants) - Σ (bond energies of products)\n\nFor the reactants, we have 2 moles of H-H bonds and 1 mole of O=O bond:\n2 moles H-H: 2 × 436 kJ/mol = 872 kJ\n1 mole O=O: 1 × 498 kJ/mol = 498 kJ\n\nFor the products, we have 4 moles of H-O bonds in 2 moles of H2O:\n4 moles H-O: 4 × 463 kJ/mol = 1852 kJ\n\nNow, we can calculate the change in enthalpy:\nΔH = (872 kJ + 498 kJ) - 1852 kJ\nΔH = 1370 kJ - 1852 kJ\nΔH = -482 kJ\n\nThe change in enthalpy for the reaction is -482 kJ."
