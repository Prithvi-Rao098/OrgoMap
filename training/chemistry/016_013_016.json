The specific heat capacity of the solution is 4.18 J/(g·°C), and the density of the solution is 1.00 g/ml. Don't forget to include the units in your final answer.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the heat of hydration of magnesium sulfate, we first need to determine the heat released during the dissolution process. We can do this using the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat released, m is the mass of the solution, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nFirst, we need to find the mass of the solution. Since the density of the solution is 1.00 g/ml, the mass of the 50.0 ml solution is:\n\nmass_solution = density × volume = 1.00 g/ml × 50.0 ml = 50.0 g\n\nNow we can calculate the heat released:\n\nΔT = T_initial - T_final = 25°C - 20°C = 5°C\n\nq = mcΔT = (50.0 g)(4.18 J/(g·°C))(5°C) = 1045 J\n\nNow we need to find the heat of hydration per mole of MgSO4. First, we need to find the molar mass of MgSO4:\n\nMg = 24.31 g/mol\nS = 32.07 g/mol\nO = 16.00 g/mol\n\nMolar mass of MgSO4 = 24.31 + 32.07 + (4 × 16.00) = 120.38 g/mol\n\nNow we can find the moles of MgSO4:\n\nmoles_MgSO4 = mass_MgSO4 / molar_mass_MgSO4 = 4.17 g / 120.38 g/mol = 0.0346 mol\n\nFinally, we can calculate the heat of hydration per mole of MgSO4:\n\nheat_of_hydration = q / moles_MgSO4 = 1045 J / 0.0346 mol = 30200 J/mol\n\nThe heat of hydration of magnesium sulfate is 30,200 J/mol."
