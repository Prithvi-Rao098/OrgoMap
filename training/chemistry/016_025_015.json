Given the molar mass of NaCl is 58.44 g/mol and the specific heat capacity of water is 4.184 J/(g°C), calculate the change in temperature of the water if the dissolution process is exothermic and releases 500 kJ of energy.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to determine the number of moles of NaCl in 5.00 grams.\n\nmoles of NaCl = mass / molar mass\nmoles of NaCl = 5.00 g / 58.44 g/mol\nmoles of NaCl = 0.0856 mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change per mole of NaCl.\n\nenthalpy change = energy released / moles of NaCl\nenthalpy change = 500 kJ / 0.0856 mol\nenthalpy change = 5841.86 kJ/mol\n\nNext, we need to determine the mass of water in the solution. Since the density of water is approximately 1 g/mL, the mass of 100.0 mL of water is 100.0 grams.\n\nNow, we can calculate the change in temperature of the water using the specific heat capacity formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat absorbed or released, m is the mass of the water, c is the specific heat capacity of water, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nSince the dissolution process is exothermic, the energy released is equal to the energy absorbed by the water:\n\nq = 500 kJ * 1000 J/kJ = 500,000 J\n\nNow, we can solve for ΔT:\n\nΔT = q / (mc)\nΔT = 500,000 J / (100.0 g * 4.184 J/(g°C))\nΔT = 500,000 J / 418.4 J/°C\nΔT = 1195.22 °C\n\nThe change in temperature of the water is 1195.22 °C."
