    "message_2": "The standard enthalpy of formation of a compound is the change in enthalpy when one mole of the compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. For carbon dioxide (CO2), this means the reaction:\n\nC(graphite) + O2(gas) â†’ CO2(gas)\n\nSince the standard enthalpy of formation of graphite (C) and oxygen gas (O2) are both 0, we can focus on the enthalpy change for the formation of CO2.\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation of carbon dioxide (CO2) is -393.5 kJ/mol. This means that when one mole of CO2 is formed from graphite and oxygen gas, 393.5 kJ of heat is released."
