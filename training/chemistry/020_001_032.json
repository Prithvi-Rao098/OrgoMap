The equilibrium concentrations of NO and O2 were found to be 0.075 M and 0.15 M, respectively, at equilibrium.",
    "message_2": "To write the equilibrium constant expression for the given reaction, we use the formula:\n\nKc = [products]^m / [reactants]^n\n\nwhere Kc is the equilibrium constant, [products] and [reactants] are the concentrations of the products and reactants at equilibrium, and m and n are the stoichiometric coefficients of the balanced chemical equation.\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\n2NO(g) + O2(g) ⇌ 2NO2(g)\n\nThe equilibrium constant expression is:\n\nKc = [NO2]^2 / ([NO]^2 * [O2])\n\nNow, we are given the initial concentrations and the equilibrium concentrations of NO and O2. We can use this information to find the equilibrium concentration of NO2.\n\nInitial concentrations:\n[NO] = 0.1 M\n[O2] = 0.2 M\n[NO2] = 0 M\n\nEquilibrium concentrations:\n[NO] = 0.075 M\n[O2] = 0.15 M\n\nSince 2 moles of NO react with 1 mole of O2 to form 2 moles of NO2, the change in concentration of NO is equal to the change in concentration of NO2, and half the change in concentration of O2.\n\nChange in [NO] = Initial [NO] - Equilibrium [NO] = 0.1 - 0.075 = 0.025 M\nChange in [O2] = Initial [O2] - Equilibrium [O2] = 0.2 - 0.15 = 0.05 M\n\nEquilibrium [NO2] = Initial [NO2] + Change in [NO] = 0 + 0.025 = 0.025 M\n\nNow we can plug these equilibrium concentrations into the Kc expression:\n\nKc = [NO2]^2 / ([NO]^2 * [O2])\nKc = (0.025)^2 / ((0.075)^2 * (0.15))\n\nKc ≈ 0.0123\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction at 25°C is approximately 0.0123."
