    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant, Ka, for the dissociation of a weak acid HA, we can use the following equation:\n\nKa = [H+][A-] / [HA]\n\nAt equilibrium, the concentration of H+ is 1.0 x 10^-5 M and the concentration of A- is 0.09 M. Since the initial concentration of HA is 0.10 M and it loses 1.0 x 10^-5 M to form H+ and A-, the equilibrium concentration of HA is:\n\n[HA] = 0.10 M - 1.0 x 10^-5 M = 0.09999 M\n\nNow we can plug these values into the Ka equation:\n\nKa = (1.0 x 10^-5 M)(0.09 M) / (0.09999 M)\n\nKa = 9.0 x 10^-7\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant, Ka, for the dissociation of the weak acid HA is 9.0 x 10^-7."
