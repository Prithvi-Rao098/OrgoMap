    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the dissolution of 5 grams of ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) in water, we first need to determine the number of moles of NH4Cl in 5 grams.\n\nNumber of moles = mass / molar mass\nNumber of moles = 5 g / 53.49 g/mol = 0.0935 mol\n\nNow that we have the number of moles, we can calculate the enthalpy change using the molar enthalpy of dissolution.\n\nEnthalpy change = number of moles × molar enthalpy of dissolution\nEnthalpy change = 0.0935 mol × (-340.0 kJ/mol) = -31.79 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the dissolution of 5 grams of ammonium chloride in water is -31.79 kJ."
