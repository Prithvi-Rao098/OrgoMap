    "message_2": "To calculate the bond order of the carbon monoxide (CO) molecule using molecular orbital theory, we need to first determine the electronic configuration of the molecule and then count the number of electrons in bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals.\n\nCarbon has 6 electrons and oxygen has 8 electrons. Therefore, the CO molecule has a total of 14 electrons. The molecular orbitals for a diatomic molecule like CO are arranged in the following order of increasing energy: σ1s, σ*1s, σ2s, σ*2s, π2px = π2py, σ2pz, π*2px = π*2py, and σ*2pz.\n\nNow, let's fill the molecular orbitals with the 14 electrons, starting from the lowest energy level:\n\n1. σ1s: 2 electrons\n2. σ*1s: 2 electrons\n3. σ2s: 2 electrons\n4. σ*2s: 2 electrons\n5. π2px = π2py: 4 electrons (2 electrons in each orbital)\n6. σ2pz: 2 electrons\n\nThe remaining orbitals (π*2px = π*2py and σ*2pz) are unoccupied.\n\nNow, let's calculate the bond order using the formula:\n\nBond Order = (Number of electrons in bonding orbitals - Number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\n\nBonding orbitals: σ1s (2 electrons), σ2s (2 electrons), π2px (2 electrons), π2py (2 electrons), and σ2pz (2 electrons) = 10 electrons\nAntibonding orbitals: σ*1s (2 electrons) and σ*2s (2 electrons) = 4 electrons\n\nBond Order = (10 - 4) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3\n\nTherefore, the bond order of the carbon monoxide (CO) molecule is 3. This indicates a strong triple bond between the carbon and oxygen atoms."
