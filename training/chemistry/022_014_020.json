    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of limiting reactants and stoichiometry. First, we need to determine the molar mass of aluminum (Al) and oxygen (O2).\n\nMolar mass of Al = 26.98 g/mol\nMolar mass of O2 = 32.00 g/mol\n\nNow, we will convert the given mass of aluminum and oxygen to moles.\n\nMoles of Al = 2.5 g / 26.98 g/mol = 0.0926 mol\nMoles of O2 = 4.5 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.1406 mol\n\nNext, we will determine the limiting reactant by comparing the mole ratio of the reactants to the stoichiometry of the balanced equation.\n\nMole ratio of Al to O2 = (0.0926 mol Al) / (0.1406 mol O2) = 0.658\n\nStoichiometric ratio of Al to O2 = 4 / 3 = 1.333\n\nSince the mole ratio of Al to O2 (0.658) is less than the stoichiometric ratio (1.333), aluminum is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow, we will use stoichiometry to determine the moles of aluminum oxide (Al2O3) produced.\n\nMoles of Al2O3 = (0.0926 mol Al) * (2 mol Al2O3 / 4 mol Al) = 0.0463 mol Al2O3\n\nFinally, we will convert the moles of aluminum oxide to grams.\n\nMolar mass of Al2O3 = (2 * 26.98 g/mol) + (3 * 16.00 g/mol) = 101.96 g/mol\n\nMass of Al2O3 = (0.0463 mol Al2O3) * (101.96 g/mol) = 4.72 g\n\nTherefore, 4.72 grams of aluminum oxide can be produced when 2.5 grams of aluminum reacts with 4.5 grams of oxygen gas."
