    "message_2": "To identify the unknown compound using mass spectrometry data, we need to analyze the molecular ion peak and the fragmentation peaks. The molecular ion peak (M+) represents the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of the intact molecule, which is 167 in this case. The fragmentation peaks represent the m/z values of the fragments produced when the molecule breaks apart.\n\n1. Molecular ion peak (M+): m/z 167\nThis peak indicates the molecular weight of the compound. The molecular formula can be determined by considering the possible combinations of elements that add up to this mass. However, without additional information, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact molecular formula.\n\n2. Fragmentation peaks: m/z 150, 135, 77, and 49\nThese peaks represent the fragments produced when the molecule breaks apart. By analyzing the differences between the molecular ion peak and the fragmentation peaks, we can gain insight into the possible structure of the compound.\n\n- Loss of 17 (167 - 150): This could indicate the loss of an NH3 group (14 for N and 3 for H), suggesting the presence of an amine group in the compound.\n- Loss of 32 (167 - 135): This could indicate the loss of a methanol group (CH3OH), suggesting the presence of an alcohol or ether group in the compound.\n- Loss of 90 (167 - 77): This could indicate the loss of a large fragment, possibly a phenyl group (C6H5), suggesting the presence of a benzene ring in the compound.\n- Loss of 118 (167 - 49): This could indicate the loss of another large fragment, which might be a combination of the above-mentioned groups.\n\nConsidering the information from the fragmentation peaks, the unknown compound likely contains an amine group, an alcohol or ether group, and a benzene ring. One possible structure that fits this description is N-phenylethanamine (C8H11N), which has a molecular weight of 121. However, this does not account for the additional mass in the molecular ion peak.\n\nAnother possibility is that the compound is a derivative of N-phenylethanamine, such as N-phenylethanolamine (C8H11NO), which has a molecular weight of 137. This still does not account for the full molecular ion peak mass, but it could be further modified with additional functional groups.\n\nTo conclusively identify the unknown compound, more information would be needed, such as data from other analytical techniques like infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, or elemental analysis."
