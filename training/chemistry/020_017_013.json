    "message_1": "Determine the equilibrium constant for the reaction of the complex ion formation between silver ion (Ag+) and ammonia (NH3) in a solution at 25°C, given that the concentration of Ag+ is 0.005 M and that of NH3 is 0.025 M. The balanced equation for the reaction is Ag+ + 2NH3 ⇋ [Ag(NH3)2]+.",
    "message_2": "To determine the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction, we need to know the equilibrium concentrations of all species involved. However, we are only given the initial concentrations of Ag+ and NH3. To find the equilibrium concentrations, we can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table and use the stoichiometry of the balanced equation.\n\nInitial concentrations:\n[Ag+] = 0.005 M\n[NH3] = 0.025 M\n[Ag(NH3)2+] = 0 M (since the complex has not yet formed)\n\nChange in concentrations:\nLet x be the change in concentration for Ag+ and Ag(NH3)2+.\nSince the stoichiometry of NH3 is 2:1 with respect to Ag+, the change in concentration for NH3 will be 2x.\n\nEquilibrium concentrations:\n[Ag+] = 0.005 - x\n[NH3] = 0.025 - 2x\n[Ag(NH3)2+] = x\n\nNow we can write the expression for the equilibrium constant (Kc):\n\nKc = [Ag(NH3)2+] / ([Ag+][NH3]^2)\n\nWe need to find the value of x to determine the equilibrium concentrations and calculate Kc. To do this, we can use the solubility product constant (Ksp) for silver ion (Ag+). The Ksp for silver ion is 1.77 x 10^-10.\n\nKsp = [Ag+][NH3]^2\n\nSubstitute the equilibrium concentrations into the Ksp expression:\n\n1.77 x 10^-10 = (0.005 - x)(0.025 - 2x)^2\n\nThis is a cubic equation, which can be difficult to solve analytically. However, we can make an assumption that x is very small compared to the initial concentrations, so we can approximate:\n\n1.77 x 10^-10 ≈ (0.005)(0.025 - 2x)^2\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n1.77 x 10^-10 ≈ (0.005)(0.025)^2\nx ≈ 5.64 x 10^-7\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can find the equilibrium concentrations:\n\n[Ag+] ≈ 0.005 - 5.64 x 10^-7 ≈ 0.005 M\n[NH3] ≈ 0.025 - 2(5.64 x 10^-7) ≈ 0.025 M\n[Ag(NH3)2+] ≈ 5.64 x 10^-7 M\n\nFinally, we can calculate the equilibrium constant (Kc):\n\nKc = [Ag(NH3)2+] / ([Ag+][NH3]^2)\nKc = (5.64 x 10^-7) / ((0.005)(0.025)^2)\nKc ≈ 1.80 x 10^5\n\nThe equilibrium constant for the reaction at 25°C is approximately 1.80 x 10^5."
