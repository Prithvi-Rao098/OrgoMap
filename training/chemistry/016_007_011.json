    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy of formation of methane gas (CH4), we can use the following combustion reaction:\n\nCH4 (g) + 2 O2 (g) → CO2 (g) + 2 H2O (l)\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for this reaction, ∆H°combustion, is given as -890.36 kJ/mol. We also have the standard enthalpies of formation for H2O (l) and CO2 (g). We can use Hess's Law to determine the standard enthalpy of formation for CH4 (g).\n\nHess's Law states that the total enthalpy change for a reaction is the sum of the enthalpy changes for each step in the reaction, regardless of the order of the steps. In this case, we can write the following equations:\n\n1. CH4 (g) → C (graphite) + 2 H2 (g) ; ∆H°f = x kJ/mol (unknown)\n2. C (graphite) + O2 (g) → CO2 (g) ; ∆H°f = -393.5 kJ/mol\n3. 2 H2 (g) + O2 (g) → 2 H2O (l) ; ∆H°f = 2 * (-285.8) kJ/mol = -571.6 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can add equations 2 and 3 to get the combustion reaction:\n\nC (graphite) + 2 H2 (g) + 2 O2 (g) → CO2 (g) + 2 H2O (l)\n\nThe enthalpy change for this reaction is the sum of the enthalpy changes for equations 2 and 3:\n\n∆H°combustion = -393.5 kJ/mol + (-571.6 kJ/mol) = -965.1 kJ/mol\n\nHowever, we are given that the actual ∆H°combustion of methane is -890.36 kJ/mol. Therefore, the difference between these two values is the standard enthalpy of formation of CH4 (g):\n\nx = -890.36 kJ/mol - (-965.1 kJ/mol) = 74.74 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy of formation of methane gas (CH4) is 74.74 kJ/mol."
