    "message_2": "For a first-order reaction, the integrated rate law is given by:\n\nln([A]t/[A]0) = -kt\n\nwhere [A]t is the concentration of the reactant at time t, [A]0 is the initial concentration of the reactant, k is the rate constant, and t is the time.\n\nIn this case, the initial concentration of hydrogen peroxide, [A]0, is 0.1 M. After 5 minutes (300 seconds), 80% of the hydrogen peroxide has decomposed, so the remaining concentration, [A]t, is 20% of the initial concentration, which is 0.02 M.\n\nNow we can plug these values into the integrated rate law equation:\n\nln(0.02/0.1) = -k * 300\n\nSolving for k:\n\nk = - (ln(0.02/0.1) / 300)\nk ≈ 0.00796 s⁻¹\n\nSo, the rate constant for the first-order decomposition of hydrogen peroxide under these conditions is approximately 0.00796 s⁻¹."
