    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of stoichiometry. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction between silver nitrate (AgNO₃) and sodium chloride (NaCl) is:\n\nAgNO₃(aq) + NaCl(aq) → AgCl(s) + NaNO₃(aq)\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of AgNO₃ reacts with 1 mole of NaCl to produce 1 mole of AgCl. Since we have excess sodium chloride, we can assume that all of the silver nitrate will react.\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of silver nitrate (AgNO₃) in the 50 mL of 0.1 M solution:\n\nmoles of AgNO₃ = (volume in L) × (molarity)\nmoles of AgNO₃ = (50 mL × (1 L / 1000 mL)) × 0.1 M\nmoles of AgNO₃ = 0.005 moles\n\nNow, we can use the stoichiometry of the reaction to find the moles of silver chloride (AgCl) formed:\n\nmoles of AgCl = moles of AgNO₃\nmoles of AgCl = 0.005 moles\n\nFinally, we can convert the moles of AgCl to mass using the molar mass of AgCl (molar mass of Ag = 107.87 g/mol, molar mass of Cl = 35.45 g/mol):\n\nmolar mass of AgCl = 107.87 g/mol + 35.45 g/mol = 143.32 g/mol\n\nmass of AgCl = (moles of AgCl) × (molar mass of AgCl)\nmass of AgCl = 0.005 moles × 143.32 g/mol\nmass of AgCl = 0.7166 g\n\nTherefore, the mass of silver chloride formed when 50 mL of 0.1 M silver nitrate is mixed with excess sodium chloride solution is approximately 0.7166 g."
