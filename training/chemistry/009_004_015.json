    "message_2": "The minimum temperature required for nuclear fusion to occur between deuterium and tritium is approximately 100 million Kelvin (100 MK or 100 x 10^6 K). This high temperature is necessary to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged nuclei and allow them to come close enough for the strong nuclear force to bind them together.\n\nThe temperature required for the fusion of heavier elements is generally higher than that for deuterium-tritium fusion. This is because heavier elements have more protons in their nuclei, leading to a stronger electrostatic repulsion that must be overcome. As a result, higher temperatures are needed to provide the kinetic energy required for the nuclei to approach each other closely enough for fusion to occur. For example, the fusion of helium nuclei (also known as the triple-alpha process) requires temperatures of around 100 million to 200 million Kelvin, while the fusion of carbon nuclei requires temperatures of around 1 billion Kelvin."
