    "message_2": "To investigate the concentrations of copper ions in a given sample of drinking water using voltammetry, follow these steps:\n\n1. Sample collection and preparation: Collect a representative sample of the drinking water to be analyzed. Filter the sample to remove any suspended particles and debris. If necessary, adjust the pH of the sample to the optimal range for voltammetric analysis (usually between 4 and 6).\n\n2. Voltammetric analysis: Set up the voltammetric instrument, which typically consists of a working electrode, a reference electrode, and a counter electrode. The working electrode is usually made of glassy carbon, gold, or platinum. The reference electrode is typically a silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) electrode, and the counter electrode is usually made of platinum.\n\n3. Calibration: Prepare a series of standard solutions containing known concentrations of copper ions. Perform voltammetric measurements on these standards to generate a calibration curve, which will be used to determine the concentration of copper ions in the drinking water sample.\n\n4. Measurement: Perform voltammetric measurements on the drinking water sample. Record the current response as a function of the applied voltage. The peak current in the voltammogram corresponds to the reduction or oxidation of copper ions in the sample.\n\n5. Data analysis: Use the calibration curve to determine the concentration of copper ions in the drinking water sample based on the measured peak current.\n\n6. Accuracy assessment: Compare the results obtained using voltammetry with those obtained using other analytical methods, such as atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) or inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Calculate the percent difference between the two methods to assess the accuracy of the voltammetric measurement technique.\n\nIf the percent difference between the voltammetric results and the results obtained using other analytical methods is within an acceptable range (typically less than 10%), the voltammetric measurement technique can be considered accurate for the determination of copper ions in drinking water samples. If the percent difference is greater than 10%, further investigation and optimization of the voltammetric method may be necessary to improve its accuracy."
