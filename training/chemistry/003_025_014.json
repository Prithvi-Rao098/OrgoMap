    "message_1": "What is the equilibrium constant (Kc) of the chemical reaction between nitrogen gas (N2) and hydrogen gas (H2) to form ammonia gas (NH3) at a temperature of 298 K and a pressure of 1.5 atm? The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is N2 (g) + 3H2 (g) ⇌ 2NH3 (g).",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction, we need to know the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) for the reaction. The standard Gibbs free energy change can be used to calculate the equilibrium constant using the following equation:\n\nKc = exp(-ΔG° / (RT))\n\nwhere R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K) and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nFor the reaction N2 (g) + 3H2 (g) ⇌ 2NH3 (g), the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) at 298 K is -33.0 kJ/mol.\n\nNow, we can calculate the equilibrium constant (Kc) using the equation:\n\nKc = exp(-(-33.0 x 1000 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K x 298 K))\n\nKc = exp(33,000 / (8.314 x 298))\n\nKc ≈ 6.0 x 10^2\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction between nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas to form ammonia gas at 298 K and 1.5 atm is approximately 6.0 x 10^2."
