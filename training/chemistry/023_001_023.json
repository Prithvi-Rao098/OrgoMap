    "message_2": "To determine the maximum yield of aspirin, we need to consider the stoichiometry of the reaction and the molecular weights of the reactants and products. The balanced chemical equation for the synthesis of aspirin is:\n\nC7H6O3 (salicylic acid) + C4H6O3 (acetic anhydride) → C9H8O4 (aspirin) + C2H4O2 (acetic acid)\n\nThe molecular weights of the compounds involved are:\n- Salicylic acid (C7H6O3): 138.12 g/mol\n- Aspirin (C9H8O4): 180.16 g/mol\n\nFirst, we need to determine the moles of salicylic acid used in the reaction:\nmoles of salicylic acid = mass / molecular weight\nmoles of salicylic acid = 5 g / 138.12 g/mol = 0.0362 mol\n\nSince the reaction has a 1:1 stoichiometry, the moles of aspirin produced will also be 0.0362 mol. Now, we can calculate the mass of aspirin produced:\nmass of aspirin = moles of aspirin × molecular weight of aspirin\nmass of aspirin = 0.0362 mol × 180.16 g/mol = 6.52 g\n\nHowever, the purity of the final product is 98%, so we need to account for this:\nmass of pure aspirin = mass of aspirin × purity\nmass of pure aspirin = 6.52 g × 0.98 = 6.39 g\n\nTherefore, the maximum yield of aspirin that can be obtained from 5 grams of salicylic acid and excess acetic anhydride, under optimized reaction conditions and with a purity of 98%, is approximately 6.39 grams."
