    "message_1": "What is the yield of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid produced from the reaction of 10 grams of benzoic acid with excess nitric acid in the presence of sulfuric acid catalyst under reflux, if the experimental yield obtained was 7.5 grams?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the yield of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid, we need to first determine the theoretical yield and then compare it with the experimental yield.\n\n1. Write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nC7H6O2 (benzoic acid) + 2 HNO3 (nitric acid) â†’ C7H4N2O6 (2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid) + 2 H2O (water)\n\n2. Calculate the molar mass of the reactants and product:\n\nBenzoic acid (C7H6O2): (12.01 * 7) + (1.01 * 6) + (16.00 * 2) = 122.12 g/mol\n2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid (C7H4N2O6): (12.01 * 7) + (1.01 * 4) + (14.01 * 2) + (16.00 * 6) = 212.14 g/mol\n\n3. Convert the mass of benzoic acid to moles:\n\n10 g / 122.12 g/mol = 0.0819 moles\n\n4. Determine the stoichiometry of the reaction:\n\nFrom the balanced chemical equation, 1 mole of benzoic acid reacts to produce 1 mole of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid.\n\n5. Calculate the theoretical yield of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid:\n\n0.0819 moles * 212.14 g/mol = 17.37 g\n\n6. Calculate the percentage yield:\n\n(Experimental yield / Theoretical yield) * 100\n(7.5 g / 17.37 g) * 100 = 43.2%\n\nThe yield of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid produced from the reaction is 43.2%."
