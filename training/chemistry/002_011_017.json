    "message_2": "Xenon hexafluoride (XeF4) is a compound formed by the central atom Xenon (Xe) bonded to four Fluorine (F) atoms. To determine its molecular geometry and polarity, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the electron geometry using the VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) theory.\n2. Determine the molecular geometry based on the electron geometry.\n3. Determine the polarity based on the molecular geometry and electronegativity differences.\n\nStep 1: Electron Geometry\nXenon has 8 valence electrons, and each fluorine atom has 7 valence electrons. In XeF4, four fluorine atoms share one electron each with Xenon, resulting in 4 single bonds. The remaining 4 electrons on Xenon form 2 lone pairs. So, there are a total of 6 electron groups (4 single bonds + 2 lone pairs) around the central atom.\n\nAccording to the VSEPR theory, the electron geometry for 6 electron groups is octahedral.\n\nStep 2: Molecular Geometry\nNow, we need to consider the positions of the atoms and lone pairs in the octahedral electron geometry. The molecular geometry of XeF4 is square planar, with the four fluorine atoms occupying the equatorial positions and the two lone pairs occupying the axial positions.\n\nStep 3: Polarity\nTo determine the polarity of XeF4, we need to consider the electronegativity differences between Xenon and Fluorine and the molecular geometry. Fluorine is more electronegative than Xenon, so there is a dipole moment in each Xe-F bond. However, due to the square planar geometry, these dipole moments cancel each other out, resulting in a nonpolar molecule.\n\nIn conclusion, the molecular geometry of XeF4 is square planar, and the compound is nonpolar."
