    "message_2": "The preparation of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline from aniline and chlorine gas involves two main steps: nitration and chlorination. \n\n1. Nitration of aniline:\nC6H7N + HNO3 -> C6H6N2O2 + H2O\n\nIn this step, aniline (C6H7N) reacts with nitric acid (HNO3) to form 4-nitroaniline (C6H6N2O2) and water (H2O).\n\n2. Chlorination of 4-nitroaniline:\nC6H6N2O2 + Cl2 -> C6H5ClN2O2 + HCl\n\nIn this step, 4-nitroaniline (C6H6N2O2) reacts with chlorine gas (Cl2) to form 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline (C6H5ClN2O2) and hydrogen chloride (HCl).\n\nOverall balanced chemical equation:\nC6H7N + HNO3 + Cl2 -> C6H5ClN2O2 + H2O + HCl"
