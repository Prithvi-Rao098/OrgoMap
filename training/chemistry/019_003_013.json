    "message_2": "To calculate the heat capacity of the water, we can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat absorbed (in Joules), m is the mass of the water (in grams), c is the specific heat capacity of the water (in J/g°C), and ΔT is the change in temperature (in °C).\n\nWe are given the mass of the water (m = 10 g), the change in temperature (ΔT = 5°C), and the heat absorbed (q = 200 J). We need to find the specific heat capacity (c) of the water.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for c:\n\nc = q / (mΔT)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nc = 200 J / (10 g × 5°C)\n\nc = 200 J / 50 g°C\n\nc = 4 J/g°C\n\nThe heat capacity of 10 grams of water is 4 J/g°C."
