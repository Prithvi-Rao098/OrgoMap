    "message_2": "The type of bonding present in the compound lead(II) sulfide (PbS) is ionic bonding. \n\nReasoning:\nLead(II) sulfide is composed of lead (Pb) and sulfur (S) ions. Lead is a metal (from Group 14 of the periodic table) and has a tendency to lose electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration. In this case, lead(II) means it loses 2 electrons, forming a Pb²⁺ cation. \n\nOn the other hand, sulfur is a non-metal (from Group 16 of the periodic table) and has a tendency to gain electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration. Sulfur needs to gain 2 electrons to complete its octet, forming a S²⁻ anion.\n\nIn PbS, the positively charged Pb²⁺ cation and the negatively charged S²⁻ anion are attracted to each other due to the electrostatic forces between them, resulting in the formation of an ionic bond. This ionic bond holds the lead(II) sulfide compound together."
