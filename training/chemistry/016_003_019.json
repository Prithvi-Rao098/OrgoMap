    "message_2": "To calculate the bond dissociation energy for the C-H bond in methane, we need to find the enthalpy change for the reaction CH4(g) → C(g) + 4H(g). We can do this using the given information and Hess's Law, which states that the enthalpy change of a reaction is the same, whether it occurs in one step or several steps.\n\nFirst, let's write down the given reactions:\n\n1. CH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(g)    ΔH1 = -890.3 kJ/mol\n2. 2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(g)    ΔH2 = -484.2 kJ/mol\n\nWe want to find the enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\n3. CH4(g) → C(g) + 4H(g)    ΔH3 = ?\n\nTo do this, we need to manipulate the given reactions in such a way that when we add them, we get the desired reaction. We can start by reversing reaction 2 and then multiplying it by 2:\n\n2'. 2H2O(g) → 2H2(g) + O2(g)    ΔH2' = +484.2 kJ/mol (reversed sign)\n2''. 4H2O(g) → 4H2(g) + 2O2(g)    ΔH2'' = +968.4 kJ/mol (multiplied by 2)\n\nNow, we can add reactions 1 and 2'' to get the desired reaction:\n\n1. CH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(g)    ΔH1 = -890.3 kJ/mol\n2''. 4H2O(g) → 4H2(g) + 2O2(g)    ΔH2'' = +968.4 kJ/mol\n----------------------------------------------\n3. CH4(g) → C(g) + 4H(g) + CO2(g)    ΔH3 = ΔH1 + ΔH2'' = -890.3 + 968.4 = 78.1 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we need to account for the formation of CO2(g) from C(g) and O2(g). The enthalpy change for this reaction is:\n\n4. C(g) + O2(g) → CO2(g)    ΔH4 = -393.5 kJ/mol (standard enthalpy of formation for CO2)\n\nFinally, we can subtract reaction 4 from reaction 3 to get the bond dissociation energy for the C-H bond in methane:\n\n3. CH4(g) → C(g) + 4H(g) + CO2(g)    ΔH3 = 78.1 kJ/mol\n4. C(g) + O2(g) → CO2(g)    ΔH4 = -393.5 kJ/mol\n----------------------------------------------\n5. CH4(g) → C(g) + 4H(g)    ΔH5 = ΔH3 - ΔH4 = 78.1 - (-393.5) = 471.6 kJ/mol\n\nThe bond dissociation energy for the C-H bond in methane is 471.6 kJ/mol."
