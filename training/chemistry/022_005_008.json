    "message_2": "The balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane gas (CH4) is:\n\nCH4 + 2O2 â†’ CO2 + 2H2O\n\nHere, methane (CH4) reacts with oxygen (O2) to produce carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). The coefficients indicate the stoichiometric amounts of each molecule involved in the reaction."
