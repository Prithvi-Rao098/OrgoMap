    "message_2": "To find the heat of reaction for the combustion of 1 mole of butane, we need to analyze the given reactions and their heats of reaction.\n\nThe first reaction is the combustion of butane itself:\nC4H10(g) + 13/2 O2(g) → 4CO2(g) + 5H2O(l) ΔH = -2877 kJ/mol\n\nThe second and third reactions involve the formation of CO and CO2 from graphite and oxygen:\n2C(graphite) + O2(g) → 2CO(g) ΔH = -221.0 kJ/mol\n2CO(g) + O2(g) → 2CO2(g) ΔH = -566.0 kJ/mol\n\nHowever, these reactions do not directly involve butane. Therefore, the heat of reaction for the combustion of 1 mole of butane is given by the first reaction:\n\nΔH = -2877 kJ/mol"
