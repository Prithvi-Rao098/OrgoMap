    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the ionization of magnesium, we need to consider both ionization steps. Magnesium has two valence electrons, so it will lose both electrons to form a Mg²⁺ ion.\n\nThe first ionization energy is given as 738 kJ/mol, which corresponds to the removal of the first electron:\n\nMg(g) → Mg⁺(g) + e⁻    ΔH₁ = +738 kJ/mol\n\nThe second ionization energy is given as 1450 kJ/mol, which corresponds to the removal of the second electron:\n\nMg⁺(g) → Mg²⁺(g) + e⁻    ΔH₂ = +1450 kJ/mol\n\nTo find the total enthalpy change for the ionization of magnesium, we need to add the enthalpy changes for both ionization steps:\n\nΔH_total = ΔH₁ + ΔH₂\nΔH_total = (+738 kJ/mol) + (+1450 kJ/mol)\nΔH_total = +2188 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the enthalpy change for the ionization of magnesium is +2188 kJ/mol."
