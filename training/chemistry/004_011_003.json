    "message_1": "What is the molecular structure of the unknown compound X based on the peaks observed in its nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum?",
    "message_2": "To determine the molecular structure of the unknown compound X, I would need specific information about the peaks observed in its nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum. NMR spectra provide information about the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, their chemical environment, and their connectivity within the molecule.\n\nPlease provide the details of the peaks observed in the NMR spectrum, such as their chemical shifts, multiplicities (singlet, doublet, triplet, etc.), and integration values. With this information, I can help you interpret the spectrum and determine the molecular structure of the compound."
