    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (K) of the weak acid, we can use the formula for the dissociation constant (Ka) and the equilibrium concentrations of the species involved in the reaction. The dissociation reaction of the weak acid, HA, can be represented as:\n\nHA ⇌ H+ + A-\n\nGiven that the initial concentration of HA is 0.1 M and 10% of it dissociates, we can find the equilibrium concentrations of each species.\n\nInitial concentrations:\n[HA] = 0.1 M\n[H+] = 0 M\n[A-] = 0 M\n\nSince 10% of HA dissociates:\nΔ[HA] = -0.1 * 0.1 = -0.01 M\nΔ[H+] = +0.01 M\nΔ[A-] = +0.01 M\n\nEquilibrium concentrations:\n[HA] = 0.1 - 0.01 = 0.09 M\n[H+] = 0 + 0.01 = 0.01 M\n[A-] = 0 + 0.01 = 0.01 M\n\nNow, we can use the Ka expression to find the equilibrium constant (K):\n\nKa = [H+][A-] / [HA]\n\nGiven that Ka = 1.8 x 10^-5:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 = (0.01)(0.01) / (0.09)\n\nNow, we can solve for K:\n\nK = (1.8 x 10^-5) * (0.09) / (0.01 * 0.01)\nK = 1.62 x 10^-4\n\nThe equilibrium constant (K) for the weak acid is 1.62 x 10^-4."
