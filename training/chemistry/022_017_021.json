    "message_1": "Sure, here's a problem for the chemistry student to solve:\n\nGiven the following thermochemical equations:\n\n1. 2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(l) ΔH = -572 kJ/mol \n2. C(graphite) + O2(g) → CO2(g) ΔH = -394 kJ/mol \n3. H2(g) + 1/2O2(g) → H2O(l) ΔH = -286 kJ/mol \n\nUse Hess's Law to calculate the enthalpy change, ΔH, for the reaction:\n\nC(graphite) + 2H2(g) → CH4(g)\n\nHint: Use algebra and the given thermochemical equations to manipulate them in a way that cancels out the given reactant and separates the desired product.",
    "message_2": "To use Hess's Law, we need to manipulate the given thermochemical equations to obtain the desired reaction. We can do this by reversing and/or multiplying the equations to cancel out unwanted species and obtain the desired product.\n\nFirst, we need to reverse equation 2 to get the formation of C(graphite) from CO2(g):\n\n2'. CO2(g) → C(graphite) + O2(g) ΔH = +394 kJ/mol\n\nNext, we need to reverse equation 3 and multiply it by 2 to get the formation of 2H2(g) from 2H2O(l):\n\n3'. 2H2O(l) → 2H2(g) + O2(g) ΔH = +572 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can add equations 2' and 3' to obtain the desired reaction:\n\n2'. CO2(g) → C(graphite) + O2(g) ΔH = +394 kJ/mol\n3'. 2H2O(l) → 2H2(g) + O2(g) ΔH = +572 kJ/mol\n---------------------------------------------\nC(graphite) + 2H2(g) → CH4(g) ΔH = ?\n\nFinally, we can add the enthalpy changes of the manipulated equations to find the enthalpy change for the desired reaction:\n\nΔH = (+394 kJ/mol) + (+572 kJ/mol) = +966 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the enthalpy change for the reaction C(graphite) + 2H2(g) → CH4(g) is +966 kJ/mol."
