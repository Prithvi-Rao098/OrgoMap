    "message_2": "The rate constant (k) of a first-order reaction can be calculated using the half-life (t1/2) with the following equation:\n\nk = ln(2) / t1/2\n\nGiven that the half-life (t1/2) is 10 seconds, we can calculate the rate constant (k) as follows:\n\nk = ln(2) / 10\n\nk ≈ 0.0693 s⁻¹\n\nThe rate constant of the first-order reaction is approximately 0.0693 s⁻¹. Note that the initial concentration is not needed to calculate the rate constant for a first-order reaction."
