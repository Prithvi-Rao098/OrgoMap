    "message_1": "What is the effect of increasing the pressure on the equilibrium position of a reaction that produces more moles of gas?",
    "message_2": "When the pressure is increased on a reaction at equilibrium that produces more moles of gas, the equilibrium position will shift in the direction that produces fewer moles of gas. This is in accordance with Le Chatelier's principle, which states that when a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in pressure, temperature, or concentration of reactants or products, the system will adjust its equilibrium position to counteract the change.\n\nIn this case, increasing the pressure will cause the reaction to shift towards the side with fewer moles of gas to reduce the pressure. This means that the reaction will favor the side with fewer moles of gas, and the concentration of the reactants and products will adjust accordingly."
