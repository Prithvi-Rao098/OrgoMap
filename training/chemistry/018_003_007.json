    "message_2": "Increasing the temperature of a reaction between hydrochloric acid and magnesium ribbon will generally increase the rate of the reaction. This effect can be explained using the Collision Theory, which states that for a reaction to occur, the reactant particles must collide with each other with sufficient energy and proper orientation.\n\nWhen the temperature is increased, the kinetic energy of the particles also increases. This leads to the particles moving faster and colliding more frequently. As a result, there is a higher probability of successful collisions with the required energy and orientation, leading to an increased rate of reaction.\n\nIn summary, increasing the temperature of the reaction between hydrochloric acid and magnesium ribbon will increase the rate of the reaction due to the increased frequency and energy of collisions between the reactant particles, as explained by the Collision Theory."
