Provide the balanced chemical equation and draw the reaction mechanism showing the flow of electrons. Also, discuss the stereochemistry of the product formed.",
    "message_2": "The reaction mechanism of a nucleophilic substitution of a primary halogenoalkane with a strong nucleophile such as hydroxide ion is called an SN2 (Substitution Nucleophilic Bimolecular) reaction. In this reaction, the nucleophile attacks the carbon atom bearing the halogen atom, leading to the formation of an alkoxide intermediate and the subsequent displacement of the halogen atom as a leaving group.\n\nBalanced chemical equation:\nR-X + OH- â†’ R-OH + X-\n\nWhere R represents an alkyl group, X is a halogen atom (e.g., Cl, Br, or I), and OH- is the hydroxide ion.\n\nReaction mechanism:\n1. The lone pair of electrons on the oxygen atom of the hydroxide ion (OH-) attacks the carbon atom bearing the halogen atom (R-X).\n2. Simultaneously, the carbon-halogen bond breaks, and the halogen atom leaves as a halide ion (X-).\n\nThe flow of electrons can be represented as follows:\n- The lone pair of electrons on the oxygen atom of the hydroxide ion forms a bond with the carbon atom.\n- The electrons in the carbon-halogen bond move towards the halogen atom, resulting in the formation of the halide ion.\n\nStereochemistry of the product:\nIn an SN2 reaction, the nucleophile attacks the substrate from the opposite side of the leaving group. This results in an inversion of stereochemistry at the reaction center. If the starting material is a chiral molecule, the product will have the opposite configuration (R to S or S to R). If the starting material is achiral, the product will also be achiral.\n\nIn summary, the nucleophilic substitution of a primary halogenoalkane with a strong nucleophile such as hydroxide ion follows an SN2 mechanism, leading to the formation of an alcohol with an inversion of stereochemistry at the reaction center."
