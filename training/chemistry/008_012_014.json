    "message_2": "The type of oil spilled plays a significant role in determining its impact on the environment, particularly in terms of toxicity and persistence. There are several types of oil, including light, medium, and heavy oils, as well as non-conventional oils like bitumen. Each type has unique properties that influence how it interacts with the environment.\n\n1. Light oils: These include gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. Light oils are highly toxic due to their high concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). They evaporate quickly, reducing their persistence in the environment. However, their rapid evaporation can lead to the formation of toxic vapors that pose a risk to human health and wildlife.\n\n2. Medium oils: Examples include crude oils and some types of fuel oils. Medium oils are less toxic than light oils but still contain harmful components like PAHs. They evaporate more slowly than light oils, increasing their persistence in the environment. Medium oils can form oil slicks on the water surface, which can harm aquatic life and birds. They can also cause long-term damage to shorelines and coastal ecosystems.\n\n3. Heavy oils: These include heavy fuel oils, lubricating oils, and some types of crude oils. Heavy oils are generally less toxic than light and medium oils but are more persistent in the environment due to their high viscosity and resistance to evaporation. They can smother plants and animals, causing long-term damage to ecosystems. Heavy oils are also more likely to sink, making them difficult to clean up and increasing their potential to contaminate sediments and benthic organisms.\n\n4. Non-conventional oils: Bitumen, found in oil sands, is an example of a non-conventional oil. It is highly viscous and dense, making it difficult to clean up and more persistent in the environment. Bitumen can also contain high levels of toxic compounds like PAHs and heavy metals, posing risks to both aquatic and terrestrial life.\n\nIn summary, the type of oil spilled affects its impact on the environment in terms of toxicity and persistence. Light oils are generally more toxic but less persistent, while heavy oils and non-conventional oils are less toxic but more persistent. Medium oils fall in between these two categories. Understanding the properties of different oil types is crucial for effective spill response and mitigation efforts."
