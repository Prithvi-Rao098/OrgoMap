    "message_2": "The self-assembly of supramolecular structures can be controlled to create new functional materials with specific properties by manipulating various factors such as molecular design, external stimuli, and environmental conditions. Here are some strategies to achieve this:\n\n1. Molecular design: Designing and synthesizing molecules with specific functional groups, shapes, and sizes can lead to the formation of supramolecular structures with desired properties. This can be achieved by incorporating hydrogen bonding, metal coordination, van der Waals forces, π-π interactions, and electrostatic interactions in the molecular design.\n\n2. External stimuli: The self-assembly process can be controlled by applying external stimuli such as light, temperature, pH, electric or magnetic fields, and mechanical forces. These stimuli can induce changes in the molecular conformation, leading to the formation of supramolecular structures with specific properties.\n\n3. Environmental conditions: The self-assembly process can be influenced by environmental conditions such as solvent polarity, ionic strength, and concentration. By adjusting these parameters, the supramolecular structures can be tuned to exhibit desired properties.\n\n4. Template-assisted self-assembly: Using templates, such as surfaces, nanoparticles, or other pre-existing structures, can guide the self-assembly process and result in the formation of supramolecular structures with specific properties. This approach can be used to create complex hierarchical structures with precise control over their morphology and function.\n\n5. Co-assembly: Combining different types of molecules or building blocks can lead to the formation of hybrid supramolecular structures with unique properties. This strategy can be used to create multifunctional materials with a combination of properties that cannot be achieved by using a single type of building block.\n\n6. Dynamic covalent chemistry: Incorporating dynamic covalent bonds in the molecular design can enable the formation of supramolecular structures that can adapt and reconfigure in response to external stimuli. This approach can be used to create smart materials with tunable properties and self-healing capabilities.\n\nBy employing these strategies, chemists can control the self-assembly of supramolecular structures to create new functional materials with specific properties for various applications, such as drug delivery, sensing, energy storage, and catalysis."
