    "message_2": "To calculate the corrosion potential of a galvanic couple, we need to determine the difference in potential between the two electrodes. In this case, we have a Zn electrode at -0.76 V and a Cu electrode at +0.34 V.\n\nThe corrosion potential (E_corr) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nE_corr = E_Cu - E_Zn\n\nwhere E_Cu is the potential of the Cu electrode and E_Zn is the potential of the Zn electrode.\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nE_corr = (+0.34 V) - (-0.76 V) = 0.34 V + 0.76 V = 1.1 V\n\nThe corrosion potential of the galvanic couple composed of a Zn metal and a Cu metal in a 1 M Cu2+ solution at 298 K is 1.1 V."
