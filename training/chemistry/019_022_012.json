    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction between HCl and NH3, we need to use Hess's Law. Hess's Law states that the enthalpy change of a reaction is the same, whether it occurs in one step or several steps. We can use the given reactions to create a pathway from reactants to products and sum the enthalpy changes of each step to find the overall enthalpy change.\n\nThe overall reaction we want is:\n\nHCl(aq) + NH3(aq) -> NH4Cl(s)\n\nWe can manipulate the given reactions to create this pathway:\n\n1. HCl(aq) + H2O(l) -> H3O+(aq) + Cl-(aq)  ΔH1 = -74.8 kJ/mol\n2. NH3(aq) + H2O(l) ⇌ NH4+(aq) + OH-(aq)   ΔH2 = -51.8 kJ/mol\n3. NH4Cl(s) → NH4+(aq) + Cl-(aq)   ΔH3 = 15.2 kJ/mol\n\nFirst, reverse reaction 3 to get Cl-(aq) and NH4+(aq) on the reactant side:\n\n3. NH4+(aq) + Cl-(aq) → NH4Cl(s)   ΔH3' = -15.2 kJ/mol\n\nNow, add reactions 1, 2, and 3':\n\n1. HCl(aq) + H2O(l) -> H3O+(aq) + Cl-(aq)  ΔH1 = -74.8 kJ/mol\n2. NH3(aq) + H2O(l) ⇌ NH4+(aq) + OH-(aq)   ΔH2 = -51.8 kJ/mol\n3. NH4+(aq) + Cl-(aq) → NH4Cl(s)   ΔH3' = -15.2 kJ/mol\n--------------------------------------------------------\n   HCl(aq) + NH3(aq) -> NH4Cl(s)   ΔH = ?\n\nNow, sum the enthalpy changes:\n\nΔH = ΔH1 + ΔH2 + ΔH3' = -74.8 kJ/mol + (-51.8 kJ/mol) + (-15.2 kJ/mol) = -141.8 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change for the reaction between HCl and NH3 to produce NH4Cl is -141.8 kJ/mol."
