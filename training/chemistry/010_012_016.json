    "message_2": "To find the value of the Faraday constant, we first need to determine the amount of charge passed through the solution during electrolysis. We can do this using the formula:\n\nCharge (Q) = Current (I) × Time (t)\n\nGiven that the current (I) is 2.5 A and the time (t) is 30 minutes (or 1800 seconds), we can calculate the charge:\n\nQ = 2.5 A × 1800 s = 4500 Coulombs\n\nNow, we know that during the electrolysis of copper ions, the following half-reaction occurs:\n\nCu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu\n\nThis means that 2 moles of electrons are required to reduce 1 mole of copper ions to copper metal. Since there are 0.1 moles of copper ions in the solution, we can calculate the total moles of electrons required for complete electrolysis:\n\nMoles of electrons = 0.1 mol Cu²⁺ × (2 mol e⁻ / 1 mol Cu²⁺) = 0.2 mol e⁻\n\nNow, we can find the Faraday constant (F) using the formula:\n\nFaraday constant (F) = Charge (Q) / Moles of electrons\n\nF = 4500 C / 0.2 mol e⁻ = 22500 C/mol e⁻\n\nSo, the value of the Faraday constant in this case is 22500 Coulombs per mole of electrons."
