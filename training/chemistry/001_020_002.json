    "message_2": "The electrophilic addition reaction of HBr with propene involves the following steps:\n\n1. Protonation of the alkene double bond:\nIn the first step, the alkene (propene) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic hydrogen atom of HBr. This leads to the formation of a carbocation intermediate and a bromide ion (Br-). The carbocation intermediate can be formed at two different positions, leading to two possible carbocations: a primary carbocation (1째) and a secondary carbocation (2째).\n\nPropene + HBr -> [CH3-CH2-CH2+] + Br-\n\n2. Formation of major and minor products:\nThe bromide ion (Br-) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbocation intermediate. The major product is formed when the bromide ion attacks the more stable carbocation intermediate, while the minor product is formed when the bromide ion attacks the less stable carbocation intermediate.\n\nMajor product: The secondary carbocation (2째) is more stable due to the inductive effect and hyperconjugation. Therefore, the bromide ion preferentially attacks the secondary carbocation, leading to the formation of 2-bromopropane as the major product.\n\n[CH3-CH2-CH2+] + Br- -> CH3-CHBr-CH3 (2-bromopropane)\n\nMinor product: The primary carbocation (1째) is less stable, but it can still react with the bromide ion to form 1-bromopropane as the minor product.\n\n[CH3-CH2-CH2+] + Br- -> CH2Br-CH2-CH3 (1-bromopropane)\n\nIn summary, the electrophilic addition reaction of HBr with propene involves the formation of a carbocation intermediate, which then reacts with the bromide ion to form the major product (2-bromopropane) and the minor product (1-bromopropane). The major product is formed from the more stable secondary carbocation, while the minor product is formed from the less stable primary carbocation."
