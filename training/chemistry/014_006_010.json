    "message_2": "In the complex [Fe(H2O)6]Cl3, the coordination number and oxidation state of the central metal ion (Fe) can be determined as follows:\n\nCoordination Number: The coordination number refers to the number of ligands (in this case, water molecules) that are directly bonded to the central metal ion. In the complex [Fe(H2O)6]Cl3, there are six water molecules bonded to the Fe ion, so the coordination number is 6.\n\nOxidation State: To determine the oxidation state of the central metal ion, we need to consider the overall charge of the complex and the charges of the ligands. Water is a neutral ligand, meaning it does not contribute any charge to the complex. The complex has a charge of +3 (indicated by the three Cl- ions balancing the charge). Since there are no other charged species within the complex, the oxidation state of the Fe ion must be +3.\n\nSo, the coordination number of the central metal ion (Fe) in the complex [Fe(H2O)6]Cl3 is 6, and its oxidation state is +3."
