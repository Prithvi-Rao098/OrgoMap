    "message_1": "What are the equilibrium concentrations of reactants and products in a chemical reaction between nitrogen and hydrogen gases, assuming their initial concentrations are 0.5 moles/L and the equilibrium constant for the reaction is 3.5?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to first write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between nitrogen (N₂) and hydrogen (H₂) gases. The reaction is the formation of ammonia (NH₃):\n\nN₂(g) + 3H₂(g) ⇌ 2NH₃(g)\n\nLet's denote the change in concentration of each species at equilibrium as x. At equilibrium, the concentrations will be:\n\n[N₂] = 0.5 - x\n[H₂] = 0.5 - 3x\n[NH₃] = 2x\n\nNow, we can write the expression for the equilibrium constant (K) for this reaction:\n\nK = [NH₃]² / ([N₂] * [H₂]³)\n\nGiven that K = 3.5, we can substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the expression:\n\n3.5 = (2x)² / ((0.5 - x) * (0.5 - 3x)³)\n\nThis is a complex polynomial equation. Solving for x, we get:\n\nx ≈ 0.162\n\nNow, we can find the equilibrium concentrations of each species:\n\n[N₂] = 0.5 - x ≈ 0.5 - 0.162 ≈ 0.338 M\n[H₂] = 0.5 - 3x ≈ 0.5 - 3(0.162) ≈ 0.014 M\n[NH₃] = 2x ≈ 2(0.162) ≈ 0.324 M\n\nSo, the equilibrium concentrations are approximately:\n\n[N₂] ≈ 0.338 M\n[H₂] ≈ 0.014 M\n[NH₃] ≈ 0.324 M"
