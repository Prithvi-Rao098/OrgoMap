    "message_2": "For the square planar complex (PtCl₂(NH₃)₂), there are two possible geometric isomers that can be formed. These are:\n\n1. cis-isomer: In this isomer, the two chloride (Cl) ligands and the two ammonia (NH₃) ligands are adjacent to each other on the same plane. The Cl-Pt-Cl and NH₃-Pt-NH₃ bond angles are both 90 degrees.\n\n2. trans-isomer: In this isomer, the two chloride (Cl) ligands and the two ammonia (NH₃) ligands are opposite to each other on the same plane. The Cl-Pt-Cl and NH₃-Pt-NH₃ bond angles are both 180 degrees.\n\nSo, there are 2 geometric isomers that can be formed for the square planar complex (PtCl₂(NH₃)₂)."
