    "message_2": "To calculate the heat required to sublime 10 grams of dry ice, we first need to determine the number of moles of carbon dioxide (CO2) present in the sample. The molecular weight of CO2 is 12.01 g/mol (C) + 2 * 16.00 g/mol (O) = 44.01 g/mol.\n\nNumber of moles = mass / molecular weight\nNumber of moles = 10 g / 44.01 g/mol = 0.227 moles\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat required for sublimation using the heat of sublimation (25.2 kJ/mol).\n\nHeat for sublimation = number of moles * heat of sublimation\nHeat for sublimation = 0.227 moles * 25.2 kJ/mol = 5.72 kJ\n\nNext, we need to calculate the heat required to raise the temperature of the gaseous CO2 from its melting point (-78.5°C) to its boiling point (-57°C). To do this, we need the specific heat capacity of gaseous CO2, which is 0.846 J/g·°C.\n\nTemperature change = final temperature - initial temperature\nTemperature change = -57°C - (-78.5°C) = 21.5°C\n\nHeat required to raise the temperature = mass * specific heat capacity * temperature change\nHeat required = 10 g * 0.846 J/g·°C * 21.5°C = 182.13 J\n\nSince we want the answer in kJ, we need to convert Joules to kJ:\n\n182.13 J * (1 kJ / 1000 J) = 0.182 kJ\n\nFinally, we can add the heat required for sublimation and the heat required to raise the temperature to find the total heat required:\n\nTotal heat required = heat for sublimation + heat to raise temperature\nTotal heat required = 5.72 kJ + 0.182 kJ = 5.902 kJ\n\nTherefore, the heat required to sublime 10 grams of dry ice and convert it to a gas at its boiling point is approximately 5.902 kJ."
