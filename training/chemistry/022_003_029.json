    "message_2": "The balanced chemical equation for the reaction between hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is:\n\nHCl (aq) + NaOH (aq) → NaCl (aq) + H2O (l)\n\nTo find the moles of sodium chloride (NaCl) produced, we first need to determine the moles of hydrochloric acid (HCl) in the 50 mL of 0.1 M solution:\n\nmoles of HCl = (volume in L) × (molarity)\nmoles of HCl = (50 mL × (1 L / 1000 mL)) × 0.1 M\nmoles of HCl = 0.005 moles\n\nSince the reaction between HCl and NaOH is a 1:1 ratio, the moles of NaCl produced will be equal to the moles of HCl reacted:\n\nmoles of NaCl = moles of HCl\nmoles of NaCl = 0.005 moles\n\nSo, 0.005 moles of sodium chloride (NaCl) will be produced when 50 mL of 0.1 M HCl is reacted with excess NaOH."
