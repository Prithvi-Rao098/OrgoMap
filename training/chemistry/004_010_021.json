    "message_2": "To find the concentration of FeCl3 in the sample, we can use the Beer-Lambert Law:\n\nA = ε * c * l\n\nwhere A is the absorbance, ε is the molar absorptivity (extinction coefficient) in L/mol/cm, c is the concentration in mol/L, and l is the path length in cm. In this case, we are given:\n\nA = 0.325\nε = 976 L/mol/cm\nl = 1 cm (assuming a standard cuvette)\n\nWe can rearrange the equation to solve for the concentration:\n\nc = A / (ε * l)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nc = 0.325 / (976 L/mol/cm * 1 cm)\nc = 0.325 / 976 L/mol\nc = 0.000333 mol/L\n\nNow, we need to convert the concentration from mol/L to g/L. To do this, we need the molar mass of FeCl3:\n\nFeCl3 = 1 * (55.845 g/mol) + 3 * (35.453 g/mol) = 162.204 g/mol\n\nNow, we can convert the concentration:\n\n0.000333 mol/L * 162.204 g/mol = 0.054 g/L\n\nFinally, we need to find the concentration in the 25 mL sample:\n\n0.054 g/L * 0.025 L = 0.00135 g\n\nSo, the concentration of FeCl3 in the 25 mL sample is approximately 0.00135 g or 1.35 mg."
