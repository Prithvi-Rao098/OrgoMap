    "message_1": "A sample of a particular radioactive isotope decays with a half-life of 50 years. If the initial mass of the sample was 500 grams, how much of the isotope will remain after 150 years?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for radioactive decay:\n\nFinal mass = Initial mass * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial mass is 500 grams, the half-life is 50 years, and the time elapsed is 150 years. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal mass = 500 * (1/2)^(150 / 50)\n\nFinal mass = 500 * (1/2)^3\n\nFinal mass = 500 * (1/8)\n\nFinal mass = 62.5 grams\n\nSo, after 150 years, 62.5 grams of the radioactive isotope will remain."
