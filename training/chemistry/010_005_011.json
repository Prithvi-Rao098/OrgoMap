    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant for the given electrochemical reaction, we first need to determine the half-reactions and their standard reduction potentials. The half-reactions are:\n\nFe2+ + 2e- → Fe(s) (Reduction half-reaction)\nAg+ + e- → Ag(s) (Reduction half-reaction)\n\nThe standard reduction potentials (E°) for these half-reactions at 25°C are:\n\nFe2+ + 2e- → Fe(s) E° = -0.44 V\nAg+ + e- → Ag(s) E° = +0.80 V\n\nSince the Fe2+ half-reaction is a reduction, we need to reverse it to make it an oxidation half-reaction:\n\nFe(s) → Fe2+ + 2e- E° = +0.44 V\n\nNow we can write the overall balanced redox reaction:\n\nFe(s) + 2Ag+ → Fe2+ + 2Ag(s)\n\nTo find the equilibrium constant (K), we can use the Nernst equation:\n\nE = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\n\nAt equilibrium, E = 0, and Q = K. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n0 = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(K)\n\nWe are given the concentrations of Fe2+ and Ag+ at equilibrium, so we can calculate the reaction quotient (Q) as:\n\nQ = [Fe2+]^1 * [Ag+]^2\n\nNow we can calculate the standard cell potential (E°) for the overall reaction:\n\nE° = E°(Ag+/Ag) - E°(Fe2+/Fe) = 0.80 V - 0.44 V = 0.36 V\n\nThe number of electrons transferred (n) in the overall reaction is 2. The Faraday constant (F) is 96485 C/mol, the gas constant (R) is 8.314 J/(mol·K), and the temperature (T) is 25°C or 298.15 K. Plugging these values into the Nernst equation:\n\n0 = 0.36 V - (8.314 J/(mol·K) * 298.15 K / (2 * 96485 C/mol)) * ln(K)\n\nSolving for K:\n\nln(K) = 0.36 V * (2 * 96485 C/mol) / (8.314 J/(mol·K) * 298.15 K)\nln(K) = 17.67\n\nTaking the exponential of both sides:\n\nK = e^17.67 ≈ 4.77 × 10^7\n\nThe equilibrium constant (K) for the given electrochemical reaction at 25°C is approximately 4.77 × 10^7."
