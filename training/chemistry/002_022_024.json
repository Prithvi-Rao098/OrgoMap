    "message_2": "To calculate the lattice energy of NaCl(s), we can use the Born-Haber cycle, which relates the lattice energy to other known thermodynamic quantities. The lattice energy (U) can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nU = ΔHf - ΔHsub - IE - EA - ΔHdiss\n\nwhere:\nΔHf = enthalpy of formation of NaCl(s) = -411.2 kJ/mol\nΔHsub = enthalpy of sublimation of Na(s) = 107.29 kJ/mol\nIE = first ionization energy of Na(g) = 495.8 kJ/mol\nEA = electron affinity of Cl(g) (we need to find this value)\nΔHdiss = enthalpy of dissociation of Cl2(g) (we need to find this value)\n\nFirst, let's find the electron affinity (EA) of Cl(g). The electron affinity of Cl is -349 kJ/mol.\n\nNext, we need to find the enthalpy of dissociation (ΔHdiss) of Cl2(g). The bond dissociation energy of Cl2 is 242 kJ/mol. Since we are breaking one mole of Cl2 into two moles of Cl, the enthalpy of dissociation is half of the bond dissociation energy:\n\nΔHdiss = 242 kJ/mol / 2 = 121 kJ/mol\n\nNow we can plug all the values into the equation:\n\nU = -411.2 kJ/mol - 107.29 kJ/mol - 495.8 kJ/mol - (-349 kJ/mol) - 121 kJ/mol\n\nU = -411.2 + 107.29 + 495.8 + 349 - 121\nU = 419.89 kJ/mol\n\nThe lattice energy of NaCl(s) at 25°C is approximately 419.89 kJ/mol."
