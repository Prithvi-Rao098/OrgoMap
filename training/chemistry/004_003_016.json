Fragmentation patterns were also observed with peaks at m/z 121 and m/z 93. Can you identify the unknown compound and explain the fragmentation pathways leading to the observed peaks?\"",
    "message_2": "To identify the unknown compound and explain the fragmentation pathways leading to the observed peaks, we need to consider the molecular ion peak and the fragmentation peaks.\n\n1. Molecular ion peak (M+): m/z 214\nThis peak represents the molecular weight of the unknown compound. The molecular formula can be determined by considering the elements that could be present in the compound and their respective atomic masses.\n\n2. Fragmentation peaks: m/z 121 and m/z 93\nThese peaks represent the fragments formed when the molecular ion breaks apart. The difference in mass between the molecular ion peak and the fragmentation peaks can give us clues about the functional groups or substructures present in the compound.\n\nFragmentation pathways:\na) M+ (214) → Fragment 1 (121) + Fragment 2 (93)\nThe difference in mass between the molecular ion peak and Fragment 1 is 214 - 121 = 93, which is equal to the mass of Fragment 2. This suggests that the compound might have a symmetrical structure or a functional group that can break apart into two equal fragments.\n\nb) M+ (214) → Fragment 1 (93) + Fragment 2 (121)\nSimilarly, the difference in mass between the molecular ion peak and Fragment 1 is 214 - 93 = 121, which is equal to the mass of Fragment 2. This also supports the idea of a symmetrical structure or a functional group that can break apart into two equal fragments.\n\nTo identify the unknown compound, we need to consider possible molecular formulas that have a molecular weight of 214 and can produce the observed fragmentation peaks. One possible molecular formula is C10H14O4, which corresponds to a molecular weight of 214.\n\nA compound with this molecular formula that can produce the observed fragmentation peaks is diethyl phthalate (DEP). DEP has a symmetrical structure with two ethyl ester groups attached to a benzene ring. The fragmentation pathways can be explained as follows:\n\n1. Cleavage of one of the ester bonds, resulting in the formation of a phthalic acid fragment (C8H6O4, m/z 166) and an ethyl fragment (C2H4O, m/z 48). The phthalic acid fragment can further lose a CO2 molecule (44 Da) to form a fragment with m/z 121 (C7H5O3).\n\n2. Cleavage of both ester bonds, resulting in the formation of a phthalic anhydride fragment (C8H4O3, m/z 148) and two ethyl fragments (C2H4O, m/z 48). The phthalic anhydride fragment can further lose a CO2 molecule (44 Da) to form a fragment with m/z 93 (C7H4O2).\n\nIn conclusion, the unknown compound is likely diethyl phthalate (DEP), and the fragmentation pathways involve cleavage of the ester bonds and loss of CO2 molecules from the resulting fragments."
