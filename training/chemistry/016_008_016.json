    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to consider three steps:\n\n1. Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C\n2. Melting the ice at 0°C\n3. Heating the water from 0°C to 20°C\n\nStep 1: Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C\nq1 = mass x specific heat capacity of ice x temperature change\nq1 = 50 g x 2.09 J/g°C x (0 - (-10))°C\nq1 = 50 g x 2.09 J/g°C x 10°C\nq1 = 1045 J\n\nStep 2: Melting the ice at 0°C\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of ice:\nnumber of moles = mass / molar mass\nnumber of moles = 50 g / 18.015 g/mol (molar mass of water)\nnumber of moles = 2.775 mol\n\nNow, we can find the heat required to melt the ice:\nq2 = number of moles x enthalpy of fusion\nq2 = 2.775 mol x 6.01 kJ/mol\nq2 = 16.67 kJ\nq2 = 16670 J (converted to Joules)\n\nStep 3: Heating the water from 0°C to 20°C\nq3 = mass x specific heat capacity of water x temperature change\nq3 = 50 g x 4.18 J/g°C x (20 - 0)°C\nq3 = 50 g x 4.18 J/g°C x 20°C\nq3 = 4180 J\n\nNow, we can find the total heat energy required by adding the heat energy from all three steps:\nTotal heat energy = q1 + q2 + q3\nTotal heat energy = 1045 J + 16670 J + 4180 J\nTotal heat energy = 21895 J\n\nTherefore, the amount of heat energy required to convert 50 grams of ice at -10°C to water at 20°C is 21,895 Joules."
