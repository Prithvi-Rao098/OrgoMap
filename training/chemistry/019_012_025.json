    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change of the dissolution reaction, we first need to determine the number of moles of NaOH in 5.00 g.\n\nThe molar mass of NaOH is:\nNa = 22.99 g/mol\nO = 16.00 g/mol\nH = 1.01 g/mol\nTotal = 22.99 + 16.00 + 1.01 = 40.00 g/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of moles of NaOH in 5.00 g:\nmoles = mass / molar mass\nmoles = 5.00 g / 40.00 g/mol = 0.125 mol\n\nWe are given the molar heat of solution of NaOH as -44.5 kJ/mol. To calculate the standard enthalpy change of the dissolution reaction, we multiply the molar heat of solution by the number of moles of NaOH:\n\nΔH = moles × molar heat of solution\nΔH = 0.125 mol × (-44.5 kJ/mol) = -5.56 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change of the dissolution reaction for 5.00 g of NaOH in 100 mL of water is -5.56 kJ."
