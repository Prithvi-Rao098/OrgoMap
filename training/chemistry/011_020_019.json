    "message_2": "The strength of hydrogen bonding between water molecules varies with temperature due to the increased kinetic energy of the molecules as the temperature increases. As water is heated from 0°C to 100°C, the hydrogen bonds between water molecules become weaker due to the increased molecular motion and collisions. This results in an increase in the average intermolecular distance between water molecules.\n\nTo determine the changes in bonding energy and intermolecular distance as water is heated from 0°C to 100°C, we can use quantum chemical calculations. One common method for these calculations is density functional theory (DFT).\n\n1. First, we need to create a model system of water molecules. For simplicity, we can consider a cluster of water molecules (e.g., a hexamer) to represent the liquid phase. This model system should be large enough to capture the essential features of hydrogen bonding but small enough to be computationally tractable.\n\n2. Next, we need to choose an appropriate level of theory for the DFT calculations. A popular choice for studying hydrogen bonding in water is the B3LYP functional with a suitable basis set, such as 6-31+G(d,p).\n\n3. Perform geometry optimizations for the water cluster at different temperatures (0°C, 25°C, 50°C, 75°C, and 100°C) using the chosen level of theory. This can be done by running molecular dynamics simulations at each temperature and extracting representative structures for the DFT calculations.\n\n4. For each optimized structure, calculate the hydrogen bonding energy and intermolecular distance between water molecules. The hydrogen bonding energy can be estimated as the difference between the total energy of the optimized cluster and the sum of the total energies of the isolated water molecules. The intermolecular distance can be calculated as the distance between the oxygen atoms of the hydrogen-bonded water molecules.\n\n5. Analyze the results to determine the changes in bonding energy and intermolecular distance as water is heated from 0°C to 100°C. As the temperature increases, the hydrogen bonding energy should decrease, and the intermolecular distance should increase.\n\nIn summary, quantum chemical calculations using density functional theory can be used to study the changes in hydrogen bonding energy and intermolecular distance between water molecules as the temperature increases from 0°C to 100°C. The results should show a weakening of hydrogen bonds and an increase in intermolecular distance with increasing temperature."
