    "message_2": "Isotopic labeling is a technique used to track the movement of atoms through a chemical reaction by replacing one or more atoms in a molecule with their isotopes. These isotopes have the same chemical properties as the original atoms but differ in mass, allowing them to be easily detected and distinguished from the original atoms. By analyzing the distribution of isotopes in the products of a reaction, chemists can gain valuable insights into the reaction pathways and mechanisms.\n\nOne example of a reaction where isotopic labeling can be applied is the study of the mechanism of the SN2 (substitution nucleophilic bimolecular) reaction. The SN2 reaction is a fundamental reaction in organic chemistry, where a nucleophile attacks an electrophilic carbon center, leading to the substitution of a leaving group. A classic example of an SN2 reaction is the reaction between sodium cyanide (NaCN) and bromoethane (C2H5Br) to form ethyl cyanide (C2H5CN) and sodium bromide (NaBr).\n\nTo study the mechanism of this reaction using isotopic labeling, we can replace one or more hydrogen atoms in bromoethane with deuterium (D), a heavier isotope of hydrogen. For example, we can use C2H4DBr instead of C2H5Br. When the reaction takes place, the nucleophile (CN-) will attack the electrophilic carbon center, and the leaving group (Br-) will be displaced. If the reaction follows the SN2 mechanism, the nucleophile should attack from the opposite side of the leaving group, leading to an inversion of stereochemistry at the carbon center.\n\nAfter the reaction, we can analyze the products using techniques such as mass spectrometry or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the distribution of deuterium in the product molecules. If the SN2 mechanism is correct, we should observe that the deuterium atom remains attached to the carbon center and the stereochemistry is inverted in the product, C2H4DCN. If an alternative mechanism, such as SN1 (substitution nucleophilic unimolecular), were in operation, we might observe a different distribution of deuterium in the products, indicating that the reaction proceeds through a different pathway.\n\nIn summary, isotopic labeling is a powerful technique for studying reaction pathways and mechanisms in chemical reactions. By replacing specific atoms with their isotopes and analyzing the distribution of these isotopes in the products, chemists can gain valuable insights into the steps and intermediates involved in a reaction, helping to improve our understanding of the underlying principles governing chemical reactivity."
