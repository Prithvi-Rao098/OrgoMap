    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the following formula:\n\nΔH_reaction = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nFor the products, we have 2 moles of NaCl(aq) and 1 mole of BaSO4(s). For the reactants, we have 1 mole of Na2SO4(aq) and 1 mole of BaCl2(aq).\n\nΔH_reaction = [(2 × -407.3) + (-1477.2)] - [(-1389.9) + (-858.8)]\n\nΔH_reaction = [(-814.6) + (-1477.2)] - [(-1389.9) + (-858.8)]\n\nΔH_reaction = (-2291.8) - (-2248.7)\n\nΔH_reaction = -43.1 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the precipitation reaction between aqueous solutions of sodium sulfate and barium chloride is -43.1 kJ/mol."
