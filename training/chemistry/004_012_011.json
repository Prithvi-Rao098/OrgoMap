    "message_2": "To determine the elemental composition of a sample of a given compound, you will need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Obtain the molecular formula of the compound. This information can be found in a reference source, such as a chemistry textbook or a database, or it can be provided to you by the person who gave you the sample.\n\n2. Determine the molar mass of the compound. To do this, you will need to know the atomic masses of each element in the compound. You can find these values on a periodic table. Multiply the atomic mass of each element by the number of atoms of that element in the molecular formula, and then add up the results to find the molar mass of the compound.\n\n3. Calculate the mass percentage of each element in the compound. To do this, divide the mass of each element in the compound (which you calculated in step 2) by the total molar mass of the compound (also calculated in step 2), and then multiply the result by 100 to get the mass percentage.\n\n4. Analyze the sample using an appropriate analytical technique, such as mass spectrometry, X-ray fluorescence, or elemental analysis. This will provide you with the actual elemental composition of the sample.\n\n5. Compare the experimental results from step 4 with the calculated mass percentages from step 3. If the values are close, then the sample likely contains the compound in question. If the values are significantly different, then the sample may be contaminated, or it may contain a different compound altogether.\n\nRemember that the elemental composition of a compound is expressed as the mass percentage of each element in the compound. By following these steps, you can determine the elemental composition of a sample of a given compound."
