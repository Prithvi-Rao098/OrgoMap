    "message_1": "In a chemical reaction, 25 grams of magnesium is reacted with 50 grams of hydrochloric acid. If magnesium is the limiting reactant, what would be the mass of the excess reactant remaining after the reaction is completed? (Assuming the reaction goes to completion and produces only one product).",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to first write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between magnesium and hydrochloric acid:\n\nMg (s) + 2 HCl (aq) â†’ MgCl2 (aq) + H2 (g)\n\nNow, we need to determine the limiting reactant. We can do this by calculating the moles of each reactant and comparing their mole ratios.\n\nFirst, find the molar mass of each reactant:\n- Magnesium (Mg): 24.31 g/mol\n- Hydrochloric acid (HCl): 36.46 g/mol\n\nNext, calculate the moles of each reactant:\n- Moles of Mg: 25 g / 24.31 g/mol = 1.03 mol\n- Moles of HCl: 50 g / 36.46 g/mol = 1.37 mol\n\nNow, compare the mole ratios of the reactants to the balanced chemical equation:\n- Moles of Mg: 1.03 mol / 1 (from the balanced equation) = 1.03\n- Moles of HCl: 1.37 mol / 2 (from the balanced equation) = 0.685\n\nSince the value for Mg (1.03) is greater than the value for HCl (0.685), magnesium is not the limiting reactant, and hydrochloric acid is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow, we need to find the mass of the excess reactant (magnesium) remaining after the reaction is completed. To do this, we'll first determine how many moles of magnesium reacted with the limiting reactant (HCl):\n\nMoles of Mg reacted = (moles of HCl) / 2 = 1.37 mol / 2 = 0.685 mol\n\nNow, calculate the mass of magnesium that reacted:\nMass of Mg reacted = (moles of Mg reacted) * (molar mass of Mg) = 0.685 mol * 24.31 g/mol = 16.65 g\n\nFinally, subtract the mass of magnesium that reacted from the initial mass of magnesium to find the mass of the excess reactant remaining:\n\nMass of excess Mg remaining = initial mass of Mg - mass of Mg reacted = 25 g - 16.65 g = 8.35 g\n\nSo, the mass of the excess reactant (magnesium) remaining after the reaction is completed is 8.35 grams."
