    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the fusion of 50 grams of ice at 0°C to liquid water at 25°C, we need to consider two steps:\n\n1. Melting the ice at 0°C to water at 0°C\n2. Heating the water from 0°C to 25°C\n\nStep 1: Melting the ice\nThe enthalpy of fusion for ice is 6.01 kJ/mol. First, we need to convert the mass of ice (50 grams) to moles.\n\nMolar mass of water (H2O) = 18.015 g/mol\n\nMoles of ice = (50 g) / (18.015 g/mol) = 2.776 moles\n\nEnthalpy change for melting ice = (2.776 moles) × (6.01 kJ/mol) = 16.68 kJ\n\nStep 2: Heating the water\nThe specific heat capacity of water is 4.18 J/g°C. We need to convert the enthalpy change to kJ.\n\nEnthalpy change for heating water = (50 g) × (4.18 J/g°C) × (25°C) = 5225 J = 5.225 kJ\n\nTotal enthalpy change = Enthalpy change for melting ice + Enthalpy change for heating water = 16.68 kJ + 5.225 kJ = 21.905 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the fusion of 50 grams of ice at 0°C to liquid water at 25°C is 21.905 kJ."
