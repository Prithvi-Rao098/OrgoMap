    "message_2": "To find the heat of formation for methane (CH4), we can use Hess's Law, which states that the total enthalpy change for a reaction is the same, regardless of the pathway taken. We can use the given information to create a reaction pathway that involves the formation of methane.\n\nConsider the following reactions:\n\n1. CH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O\n2. CO2 → C + O2 (reverse of the formation of CO2)\n3. 2H2O → 2H2 + O2 (reverse of the formation of 2 moles of H2O)\n\nNow, we can add reactions 2 and 3 to get the desired reaction:\n\nCH4 → C + 2H2\n\nWe can calculate the enthalpy change for each reaction:\n\n1. ΔH1 = ΔHf(CO2) + 2ΔHf(H2O) = -393.5 kJ/mol + 2(-285.8 kJ/mol) = -965.1 kJ/mol\n2. ΔH2 = -ΔHf(CO2) = 393.5 kJ/mol\n3. ΔH3 = -2ΔHf(H2O) = 2(285.8 kJ/mol) = 571.6 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can use Hess's Law to find the enthalpy change for the formation of methane:\n\nΔH(CH4) = ΔH1 + ΔH2 + ΔH3 = -965.1 kJ/mol + 393.5 kJ/mol + 571.6 kJ/mol = 0 kJ/mol\n\nThe heat of formation for methane (CH4) at standard conditions is 0 kJ/mol."
