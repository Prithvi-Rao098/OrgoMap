    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the phase transition reaction of solid carbon dioxide (dry ice) at -78.5°C to gaseous carbon dioxide at 1 atm and 25°C, we need to consider the following steps:\n\n1. Heating solid CO2 from -78.5°C to 0°C\n2. Sublimation of solid CO2 at 0°C to gaseous CO2\n3. Heating gaseous CO2 from 0°C to 25°C\n\nStep 1: Heating solid CO2 from -78.5°C to 0°C\nq1 = m * C_s * ΔT\nwhere m is the number of moles, C_s is the specific heat capacity of solid CO2, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nThe specific heat capacity of solid CO2 is approximately 0.835 J/g·K. Assuming 1 mole of CO2, the molar mass of CO2 is 44.01 g/mol.\n\nq1 = (44.01 g/mol) * (0.835 J/g·K) * (0 - (-78.5°C))\nq1 = 2883.6 J/mol\n\nStep 2: Sublimation of solid CO2 at 0°C to gaseous CO2\nThe enthalpy of sublimation for CO2 is 25.2 kJ/mol.\n\nq2 = 25.2 kJ/mol * 1000 J/kJ\nq2 = 25200 J/mol\n\nStep 3: Heating gaseous CO2 from 0°C to 25°C\nq3 = m * C_g * ΔT\nwhere C_g is the specific heat capacity of gaseous CO2.\n\nThe specific heat capacity of gaseous CO2 is approximately 0.854 J/g·K.\n\nq3 = (44.01 g/mol) * (0.854 J/g·K) * (25°C - 0°C)\nq3 = 940.7 J/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the total enthalpy change for the phase transition:\n\nΔH_total = q1 + q2 + q3\nΔH_total = 2883.6 J/mol + 25200 J/mol + 940.7 J/mol\nΔH_total = 29024.3 J/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the phase transition reaction of solid carbon dioxide (dry ice) at -78.5°C to gaseous carbon dioxide at 1 atm and 25°C is approximately 29.0 kJ/mol."
