    "message_1": "What is the mass percentage of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in a sample if a 2.50 g sample undergoes complete combustion and yields 1.28 g of carbon dioxide (CO2) according to the following reaction: \n\nCaCO3 (s) + 2HCl (aq) → CaCl2 (aq) + CO2 (g) + H2O (l)",
    "message_2": "To find the mass percentage of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in the sample, we first need to determine the amount of CaCO3 that produced the given amount of CO2. We can do this using stoichiometry.\n\n1. Calculate the molar mass of CO2 and CaCO3:\nCO2: C = 12.01 g/mol, O = 16.00 g/mol\nMolar mass of CO2 = 12.01 + (2 × 16.00) = 44.01 g/mol\n\nCaCO3: Ca = 40.08 g/mol, C = 12.01 g/mol, O = 16.00 g/mol\nMolar mass of CaCO3 = 40.08 + 12.01 + (3 × 16.00) = 100.09 g/mol\n\n2. Convert the mass of CO2 to moles:\n1.28 g CO2 × (1 mol CO2 / 44.01 g CO2) = 0.0291 mol CO2\n\n3. Use the stoichiometry of the balanced equation to find the moles of CaCO3:\n1 mol CaCO3 produces 1 mol CO2, so the moles of CaCO3 are equal to the moles of CO2.\n0.0291 mol CO2 = 0.0291 mol CaCO3\n\n4. Convert the moles of CaCO3 to mass:\n0.0291 mol CaCO3 × (100.09 g CaCO3 / 1 mol CaCO3) = 2.91 g CaCO3\n\n5. Calculate the mass percentage of CaCO3 in the sample:\nMass percentage = (mass of CaCO3 / total mass of sample) × 100\nMass percentage = (2.91 g CaCO3 / 2.50 g sample) × 100\n\nHowever, the calculated mass of CaCO3 (2.91 g) is greater than the mass of the sample (2.50 g), which is not possible.
