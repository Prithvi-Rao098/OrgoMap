    "message_2": "To calculate the heat of combustion of butane, we need to use Hess's Law, which states that the total enthalpy change of a reaction is the sum of the enthalpy changes of its individual steps. In this case, we can use the standard enthalpies of formation for CO2 and H2O to calculate the heat of combustion.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total enthalpy change for the products:\n\n8 mol CO2 × (-393.5 kJ/mol) = -3148 kJ\n10 mol H2O × (-285.8 kJ/mol) = -2858 kJ\n\nTotal enthalpy change for products = -3148 kJ + (-2858 kJ) = -6006 kJ\n\nSince the reactants are in their elemental forms (O2 is the elemental form of oxygen, and butane is a hydrocarbon), their standard enthalpies of formation are zero. Therefore, the total enthalpy change for the reactants is 0 kJ.\n\nNow, we can find the heat of combustion by subtracting the total enthalpy change for the reactants from the total enthalpy change for the products:\n\nHeat of combustion = -6006 kJ - 0 kJ = -6006 kJ\n\nHowever, this value is for the combustion of 2 moles of butane (2C4H10). To find the heat of combustion per mole of butane, we need to divide this value by 2:\n\nHeat of combustion per mole of butane = -6006 kJ / 2 = -3003 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the heat of combustion of butane is -3003 kJ/mol."
