    "message_2": "To find the density of sodium chloride (NaCl) at 25°C, we can use the formula:\n\nDensity = mass/volume\n\nGiven the mass of NaCl is 2.5 grams and the volume it occupies is 0.896 cm³, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nDensity = 2.5 g / 0.896 cm³\n\nDensity ≈ 2.7902 g/cm³\n\nThe density of sodium chloride (NaCl) at 25°C is approximately 2.79 g/cm³."
