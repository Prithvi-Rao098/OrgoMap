    "message_2": "The standard electrode potential for the redox reaction between copper and silver ions can be determined using the standard reduction potentials for both half-reactions.\n\nThe standard reduction potentials at 25°C and 1 atm are as follows:\n\nCu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu(s)    E° = +0.34 V\nAg⁺ + e⁻ → Ag(s)      E° = +0.80 V\n\nTo find the standard electrode potential for the overall redox reaction, we need to combine these half-reactions. First, we need to balance the electrons:\n\nCu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu(s)\n2(Ag⁺ + e⁻ → Ag(s))\n\nNow, we can combine the half-reactions:\n\nCu²⁺ + 2Ag⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu(s) + 2Ag(s) + 2e⁻\n\nThe electrons cancel out:\n\nCu²⁺ + 2Ag⁺ → Cu(s) + 2Ag(s)\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard electrode potential for the overall redox reaction by subtracting the standard reduction potential of the half-reaction being oxidized (copper) from the standard reduction potential of the half-reaction being reduced (silver):\n\nE°(cell) = E°(reduction) - E°(oxidation)\nE°(cell) = (+0.80 V) - (+0.34 V)\nE°(cell) = +0.46 V\n\nSo, the standard electrode potential for the redox reaction between copper and silver ions at 25°C and 1 atm is +0.46 V."
