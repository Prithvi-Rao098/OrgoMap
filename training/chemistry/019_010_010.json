Given the following information:\n\n- The standard enthalpy change of combustion for methane gas is -890.4 kJ/mol.\n- The heat capacity of the products is 41.9 J/mol°C and the heat capacity of the reactants is 29.1 J/mol°C.\n- The standard enthalpy of formation for water (H2O) is -285.83 kJ/mol and for carbon dioxide (CO2) is -393.51 kJ/mol.",
    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy change of combustion for methane gas (CH4) at 25°C and 1 atm pressure, we can use the given information and the following equation:\n\nΔH_comb = ΔH_f(products) - ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nThe balanced combustion reaction for methane is:\n\nCH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l)\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard enthalpy change of formation for the products and reactants:\n\nΔH_f(products) = 1 * ΔH_f(CO2) + 2 * ΔH_f(H2O) = 1 * (-393.51 kJ/mol) + 2 * (-285.83 kJ/mol) = -965.17 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_f(reactants) = ΔH_f(CH4) + 2 * ΔH_f(O2) = -890.4 kJ/mol + 2 * 0 kJ/mol = -890.4 kJ/mol (since the standard enthalpy of formation for O2 is 0)\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard enthalpy change of combustion:\n\nΔH_comb = ΔH_f(products) - ΔH_f(reactants) = -965.17 kJ/mol - (-890.4 kJ/mol) = -74.77 kJ/mol\n\nHowever, this value is for the standard enthalpy change of combustion at 298 K (25°C). To find the actual enthalpy change of combustion at 25°C, we need to account for the difference in heat capacities between the products and reactants:\n\nΔC_p = C_p(products) - C_p(reactants) = 41.9 J/mol°C - 29.1 J/mol°C = 12.8 J/mol°C\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change of combustion at 25°C:\n\nΔH_comb(25°C) = ΔH_comb + ΔC_p * (T - 298 K) = -74.77 kJ/mol + 12.8 J/mol°C * (25°C - 298 K)\n\nSince 1 kJ = 1000 J, we can convert the heat capacity to kJ:\n\nΔH_comb(25°C) = -74.77 kJ/mol + 0.0128 kJ/mol°C * (-273°C) = -74.77 kJ/mol + 3.50 kJ/mol = -71.27 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change of combustion for methane gas (CH4) at 25°C and 1 atm pressure is approximately -71.27 kJ/mol."
