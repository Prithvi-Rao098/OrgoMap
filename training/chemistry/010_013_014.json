    "message_2": "When 1 mole of magnesium is oxidized to form magnesium ions, the balanced half-reaction is:\n\nMg → Mg²⁺ + 2e⁻\n\nAccording to the balanced half-reaction, 1 mole of magnesium (Mg) loses 2 moles of electrons (2e⁻) when it is oxidized to form 1 mole of magnesium ions (Mg²⁺). \n\nTherefore, the number of electrons transferred when 1 mole of magnesium is oxidized is 2 moles of electrons. Since there are 6.022 x 10²³ particles (atoms, ions, or molecules) in 1 mole, the number of electrons transferred is:\n\n2 moles of electrons × (6.022 x 10²³ electrons/mole) = 1.204 x 10²⁴ electrons"
