    "message_1": "What is the concentration of Cu2+ ions in a solution if a current of 2 amperes is passed through a copper(II) sulfate solution for 2 hours using a cathode made of pure copper? Given: The Faraday constant is 96,485 C/mol, atomic weight of copper is 63.55 g/mol, the electrode area is 6 cm2, and initial concentration of copper(II) sulfate solution is 0.1 M. Answer in unit of molarity (M).",
    "message_2": "First, we need to calculate the amount of charge passed through the solution. \n\nCharge (Q) = Current (I) × Time (t)\nQ = 2 A × (2 hours × 3600 seconds/hour)\nQ = 2 A × 7200 s\nQ = 14,400 Coulombs\n\nNow, we need to find the moles of electrons transferred using the Faraday constant (F).\n\nMoles of electrons (n) = Charge (Q) / Faraday constant (F)\nn = 14,400 C / 96,485 C/mol\nn ≈ 0.1492 mol\n\nSince the copper(II) ion has a +2 charge, the moles of Cu2+ ions reduced at the cathode will be half the moles of electrons.\n\nMoles of Cu2+ ions = 0.1492 mol / 2\nMoles of Cu2+ ions ≈ 0.0746 mol\n\nNow, we need to find the change in concentration of Cu2+ ions in the solution. We can do this by using the initial concentration of the copper(II) sulfate solution.\n\nInitial moles of Cu2+ ions = Initial concentration × Volume\n0.1 M × Volume = 0.0746 mol\nVolume = 0.746 L\n\nNow, we can calculate the final concentration of Cu2+ ions in the solution.\n\nFinal concentration = (Initial moles of Cu2+ ions - Moles of Cu2+ ions reduced) / Volume\nFinal concentration = (0.1 M × 0.746 L - 0.0746 mol) / 0.746 L\nFinal concentration ≈ 0.0254 M\n\nThe concentration of Cu2+ ions in the solution after passing the current for 2 hours is approximately 0.0254 M."
