There are two functional groups possible for this molecular formula: aldehyde (R-CHO) and ketone (R-CO-R). \n\nHere are the possible isomers:\n\n1. Propanal (an aldehyde)\n   H3C-CH2-CHO\n\n2. Propanone (a ketone)\n   H3C-CO-CH3\n\nThese are the two possible isomers of C3H6O, exhibiting functional group isomerism."
