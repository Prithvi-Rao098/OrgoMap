    "message_2": "To calculate the heat capacity of the 50 g sample of iron, you can use the formula:\n\nHeat capacity (Q) = mass (m) × specific heat capacity (c)\n\nGiven the mass (m) of the iron sample is 50 g and the specific heat capacity (c) of iron is 0.45 J/g °C, you can plug these values into the formula:\n\nQ = 50 g × 0.45 J/g °C\n\nQ = 22.5 J/°C\n\nThe heat capacity of the 50 g sample of iron at 25°C is 22.5 J/°C."
