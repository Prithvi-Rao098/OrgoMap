    "message_2": "Carbon-11 is a radioactive isotope used as a tracer in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans. It decays through the process of beta-plus decay, also known as positron emission. In this process, a proton in the nucleus of the carbon-11 atom is converted into a neutron, releasing a positron (a positively charged electron) and a neutrino.\n\nWhen the emitted positron encounters an electron in the surrounding tissue, they annihilate each other, producing two gamma rays (high-energy photons) that travel in opposite directions. These gamma rays have an energy of 511 keV, which is a characteristic energy for positron-electron annihilation events.\n\nThe PET scanner is equipped with a ring of detectors that are sensitive to gamma rays. When the two gamma rays from the positron-electron annihilation event reach the detectors, they create an electronic signal. The scanner's computer system analyzes the signals from the detectors and calculates the location of the annihilation event within the body. By collecting data from numerous such events, the PET scanner can generate a detailed image of the distribution of the carbon-11 tracer within the body, providing valuable information about the metabolic processes and other functions in the tissues being examined."
