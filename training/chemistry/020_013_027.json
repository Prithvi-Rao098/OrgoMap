    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant (Kₐ) for the reaction of acetic acid in aqueous solution, we first need to find the concentration of hydrogen ions [H⁺] and acetate ions [CH₃COO⁻] at equilibrium. The reaction of acetic acid (CH₃COOH) in water can be represented as:\n\nCH₃COOH + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COO⁻ + H₃O⁺\n\nGiven the pH of the solution is 4.76, we can calculate the concentration of hydrogen ions [H⁺] using the formula:\n\npH = -log[H⁺]\n\n4.76 = -log[H⁺]\n\n[H⁺] = 10^(-4.76) ≈ 1.74 x 10^(-5) M\n\nSince acetic acid is a weak acid, we can assume that the concentration of hydrogen ions [H⁺] is equal to the concentration of acetate ions [CH₃COO⁻] at equilibrium. Therefore:\n\n[CH₃COO⁻] = [H⁺] ≈ 1.74 x 10^(-5) M\n\nNow, we can use the initial concentration of acetic acid (0.1 M) to find the concentration of acetic acid at equilibrium:\n\n[CH₃COOH] = Initial concentration - [CH₃COO⁻] = 0.1 - 1.74 x 10^(-5) ≈ 0.1 M\n\nFinally, we can calculate the equilibrium constant (Kₐ) using the formula:\n\nKₐ = [CH₃COO⁻][H⁺] / [CH₃COOH]\n\nKₐ = (1.74 x 10^(-5))(1.74 x 10^(-5)) / 0.1 ≈ 3.0 x 10^(-5)\n\nThe equilibrium constant (Kₐ) for the reaction of acetic acid in aqueous solution is approximately 3.0 x 10^(-5)."
