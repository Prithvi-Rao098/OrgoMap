    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of moles and the balanced chemical equation for the neutralization reaction between NaOH and HCl:\n\nNaOH + HCl → NaCl + H2O\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of NaOH reacts with 1 mole of HCl.\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of HCl in the 25 mL of 0.2 M solution:\n\nmoles of HCl = Molarity × Volume\nmoles of HCl = 0.2 mol/L × 0.025 L = 0.005 mol\n\nSince 1 mole of NaOH reacts with 1 mole of HCl, we need 0.005 moles of NaOH to neutralize the HCl.\n\nNow, we can find the volume of 0.1 M NaOH solution required:\n\nVolume = moles of NaOH / Molarity\nVolume = 0.005 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.05 L\n\nConverting to milliliters:\n\nVolume = 0.05 L × 1000 mL/L = 50 mL\n\nSo, 50 mL of 0.1 M NaOH solution is required to neutralize 25 mL of 0.2 M HCl solution."
