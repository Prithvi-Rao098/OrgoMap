    "message_1": "What is the mass percentage of calcium carbonate in a sample of limestone, given that 2 grams of the sample was dissolved in acid and the resulting solution was treated with excess of ammonium oxalate to precipitate calcium oxalate, which was then filtered, dried, and weighed to be 1.5 grams?",
    "message_2": "To find the mass percentage of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in the limestone sample, we need to first determine the amount of calcium in the calcium oxalate (CaC2O4) precipitate and then convert it back to the amount of calcium carbonate.\n\nThe molar mass of calcium oxalate (CaC2O4) is:\nCa: 40.08 g/mol\nC: 12.01 g/mol\nO: 16.00 g/mol\n\nCaC2O4 = 40.08 + (2 × 12.01) + (4 × 16.00) = 128.10 g/mol\n\nThe molar mass of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) is:\nCa: 40.08 g/mol\nC: 12.01 g/mol\nO: 16.00 g/mol\n\nCaCO3 = 40.08 + 12.01 + (3 × 16.00) = 100.09 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the moles of calcium oxalate in the 1.5 g precipitate:\nmoles of CaC2O4 = mass / molar mass = 1.5 g / 128.10 g/mol = 0.0117 mol\n\nSince there is a 1:1 ratio between calcium in calcium oxalate and calcium carbonate, the moles of calcium carbonate are also 0.0117 mol.\n\nNow, we can find the mass of calcium carbonate:\nmass of CaCO3 = moles × molar mass = 0.0117 mol × 100.09 g/mol = 1.171 g\n\nFinally, we can find the mass percentage of calcium carbonate in the limestone sample:\nmass percentage = (mass of CaCO3 / total mass of sample) × 100 = (1.171 g / 2 g) × 100 = 58.55%\n\nSo, the mass percentage of calcium carbonate in the limestone sample is approximately 58.55%."
