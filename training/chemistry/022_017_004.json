    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of methane, we need to consider the balanced chemical equation for the combustion reaction:\n\nCH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(g)\n\nNow, we can use Hess's Law to calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction. The enthalpy change for the reaction (ΔH) is equal to the sum of the enthalpies of formation of the products minus the sum of the enthalpies of formation of the reactants:\n\nΔH = [ΔHf(CO2) + 2 * ΔHf(H2O)] - [ΔHf(CH4) + ΔHf(O2)]\n\nSince O2 is an element in its standard state, its enthalpy of formation is 0 kJ/mol. Now, we can plug in the given values for the enthalpies of formation:\n\nΔH = [(-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 * (-241.8 kJ/mol)] - [(-74.8 kJ/mol) + 0]\n\nΔH = (-393.5 - 2 * 241.8 + 74.8) kJ/mol\n\nΔH = (-393.5 - 483.6 + 74.8) kJ/mol\n\nΔH = (-802.3) kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change for the combustion of methane at standard conditions is -802.3 kJ/mol."
