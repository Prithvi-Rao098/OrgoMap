    "message_2": "In the electrochemical reaction between silver and copper, silver ions (Ag+) get reduced to silver metal (Ag) while copper metal (Cu) is oxidized to copper ions (Cu2+). The half-reactions for this process are:\n\nReduction half-reaction: Ag+ + 1e- → Ag\nOxidation half-reaction: Cu → Cu2+ + 2e-\n\nIn the reduction half-reaction, 1 electron is gained by the silver ion to form silver metal. In the oxidation half-reaction, 2 electrons are lost by the copper metal to form copper ions.\n\nTo balance the overall reaction, we need to multiply the reduction half-reaction by 2 to have the same number of electrons in both half-reactions:\n\n2(Ag+ + 1e- → Ag)\n\nNow, the balanced overall reaction is:\n\n2Ag+ + Cu → 2Ag + Cu2+\n\nIn this balanced reaction, a total of 2 electrons are transferred between the silver and copper species."
