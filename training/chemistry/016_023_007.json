    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis reaction of sucrose, we need to use Hess's Law. Hess's Law states that the enthalpy change for a reaction is the same, whether it occurs in one step or several steps. We can use the given information to set up a series of reactions and then calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis reaction.\n\nFirst, let's write the balanced hydrolysis reaction for sucrose:\n\nC12H22O11 (s) + H2O (l) → 12C (s) + 11H2O (l)\n\nNow, let's consider the combustion reaction for sucrose:\n\nC12H22O11 (s) + 12O2 (g) → 12CO2 (g) + 11H2O (l)    ΔH_combustion = -5632 kJ/mol\n\nWe also have the standard enthalpy of formation for liquid water:\n\nH2 (g) + 1/2O2 (g) → H2O (l)    ΔH_formation = -285.83 kJ/mol\n\nWe need to find the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis reaction, so we need to manipulate these reactions to get the desired reaction. \n\nFirst, reverse the combustion reaction:\n\n12CO2 (g) + 11H2O (l) → C12H22O11 (s) + 12O2 (g)    ΔH = +5632 kJ/mol\n\nNext, multiply the enthalpy of formation reaction by 11 to match the number of water molecules in the hydrolysis reaction:\n\n11[H2 (g) + 1/2O2 (g) → H2O (l)]    ΔH = 11(-285.83 kJ/mol) = -3144.13 kJ/mol\n\nNow, add these two manipulated reactions:\n\n12CO2 (g) + 11H2O (l) → C12H22O11 (s) + 12O2 (g)    ΔH = +5632 kJ/mol\n11[H2 (g) + 1/2O2 (g) → H2O (l)]    ΔH = -3144.13 kJ/mol\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nC12H22O11 (s) + H2O (l) → 12C (s) + 11H2O (l)    ΔH_hydrolysis = ?\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis reaction:\n\nΔH_hydrolysis = ΔH1 + ΔH2 = 5632 kJ/mol - 3144.13 kJ/mol = 2487.87 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis reaction of sucrose is 2487.87 kJ/mol."
