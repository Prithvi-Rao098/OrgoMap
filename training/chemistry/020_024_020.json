    "message_1": "What is the effect of adding a catalyst on the equilibrium position of the redox reaction between potassium permanganate (KMnO4) and oxalic acid (H2C2O4)? Calculate the new equilibrium constant (Kc) and explain how the addition of the catalyst affects the forward and reverse reaction rates.",
    "message_2": "Adding a catalyst to a reaction does not affect the equilibrium position or the equilibrium constant (Kc) of the reaction. A catalyst works by lowering the activation energy of the reaction, which increases the rate of both the forward and reverse reactions. However, since the catalyst affects both reactions equally, the equilibrium position remains unchanged.\n\nIn the redox reaction between potassium permanganate (KMnO₄) and oxalic acid (H₂C₂O₄), the addition of a catalyst will increase the rate at which the reaction reaches equilibrium, but it will not change the equilibrium constant (Kc) or the equilibrium position.\n\nTo summarize, the addition of a catalyst to the redox reaction between KMnO₄ and H₂C₂O₄ will:\n\n1. Increase the rate of both the forward and reverse reactions.\n2. Not change the equilibrium position.\n3. Not change the equilibrium constant (Kc)."
