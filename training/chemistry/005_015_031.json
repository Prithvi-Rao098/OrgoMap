    "message_2": "During one cycle of the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle), a single Acetyl-CoA molecule is oxidized, generating the following high-energy molecules:\n\n- 3 NADH molecules\n- 1 FADH2 molecule\n- 1 GTP molecule (which can be converted to ATP)\n\nThe NADH and FADH2 molecules produced in the citric acid cycle are then used in oxidative phosphorylation (the electron transport chain and chemiosmosis) to generate ATP. The number of ATP molecules produced per NADH and FADH2 can vary slightly depending on the organism and specific conditions, but a commonly used estimate is:\n\n- 1 NADH generates approximately 2.5 ATP molecules\n- 1 FADH2 generates approximately 1.5 ATP molecules\n\nSo, during one cycle of the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, the ATP production can be calculated as follows:\n\n(3 NADH x 2.5 ATP/NADH) + (1 FADH2 x 1.5 ATP/FADH2) + 1 GTP = 7.5 ATP + 1.5 ATP + 1 ATP = 10 ATP molecules\n\nTherefore, approximately 10 ATP molecules are produced during one cycle of the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. Keep in mind that this is an estimate, and the actual number of ATP molecules produced can vary."
