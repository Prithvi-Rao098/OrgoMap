    "message_1": "Consider the following unbalanced chemical equation: \n\nFe + HCl → FeCl3 + H2 \n\nA student needs to balance this chemical equation in order to determine the coefficients of each reactant and product. What are these coefficients, and how did you arrive at them?",
    "message_2": "To balance the chemical equation, we need to ensure that the number of atoms of each element is equal on both sides of the equation. We can do this by adjusting the coefficients of each reactant and product.\n\nFe + HCl → FeCl3 + H2\n\nFirst, let's balance the Fe (iron) atoms:\n1 Fe atom on the left side and 1 Fe atom on the right side, so no changes are needed.\n\nNext, let's balance the Cl (chlorine) atoms:\n1 Cl atom on the left side (in HCl) and 3 Cl atoms on the right side (in FeCl3). To balance the Cl atoms, we need to put a coefficient of 3 in front of HCl:\n\nFe + 3HCl → FeCl3 + H2\n\nNow, let's balance the H (hydrogen) atoms:\nThere are 6 H atoms on the left side (3 HCl molecules, each with 2 H atoms) and 2 H atoms on the right side (in H2). To balance the H atoms, we need to put a coefficient of 3 in front of H2:\n\nFe + 3HCl → FeCl3 + 3H2\n\nNow the chemical equation is balanced:\n\nFe + 3HCl → FeCl3 + 3H2\n\nThe coefficients are 1 for Fe, 3 for HCl, 1 for FeCl3, and 3 for H2."
