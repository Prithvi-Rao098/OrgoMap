    "message_2": "The most commonly used radioisotope in diagnostic imaging is Technetium-99m (Tc-99m). Its half-life is approximately 6 hours. Tc-99m decays by a process called gamma emission, which involves the release of gamma rays. \n\nGamma rays are a form of high-energy electromagnetic radiation that can penetrate tissues and be detected by gamma cameras. This makes Tc-99m suitable for medical imaging purposes, as it allows for the visualization of internal structures and functions without causing significant damage to the surrounding tissues. Additionally, the relatively short half-life of Tc-99m ensures that the radioactivity in the patient's body decreases rapidly, minimizing the patient's exposure to ionizing radiation."
