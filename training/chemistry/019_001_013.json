    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change (∆H°) of combustion for methane gas (CH4), we need to consider the balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane:\n\nCH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l)\n\nNow, we can use Hess's Law, which states that the enthalpy change of a reaction is the sum of the enthalpy changes of formation of the products minus the sum of the enthalpy changes of formation of the reactants.\n\n∆H° = [∆Hf°(CO2) + 2∆Hf°(H2O)] - [∆Hf°(CH4) + 2∆Hf°(O2)]\n\nSince the heat of formation for elemental oxygen (O2) is zero, the equation becomes:\n\n∆H° = [-393.51 kJ/mol + 2(-285.83 kJ/mol)] - (-74.87 kJ/mol)\n\n∆H° = (-393.51 - 571.66 + 74.87) kJ/mol\n\n∆H° = -890.3 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change (∆H°) of combustion for methane gas (CH4) is -890.3 kJ/mol."
