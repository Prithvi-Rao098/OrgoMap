    "message_2": "The carbonate ion (CO3^2-) has three resonance structures. In each resonance structure, the central carbon atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms. The difference between the resonance structures lies in the arrangement of single and double bonds between the carbon and oxygen atoms.\n\nResonance Structure 1:\n- One carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O) and two carbon-oxygen single bonds (C-O).\n\nResonance Structure 2:\n- One carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O) and two carbon-oxygen single bonds (C-O). The double bond is with a different oxygen atom compared to Structure 1.\n\nResonance Structure 3:\n- One carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O) and two carbon-oxygen single bonds (C-O). The double bond is with the third oxygen atom, which was not double bonded in Structure 1 or 2.\n\nIn reality, the carbonate ion does not exist as any one of these resonance structures. Instead, it exists as a hybrid of all three structures. The electron density is distributed evenly among the three carbon-oxygen bonds, making them equivalent in terms of bond length and bond strength.\n\nAs a result, the bond lengths in the carbonate ion are intermediate between a typical carbon-oxygen single bond (C-O) and a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). The bond strength is also intermediate between the two, making the carbonate ion more stable than any individual resonance structure."
