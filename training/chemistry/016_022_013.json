Given that the standard enthalpy of formation for cis-2-butene is -127.0 kJ/mol, what is the standard enthalpy of formation for trans-2-butene?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the isomerization of cis-2-butene to trans-2-butene, we need to consider the bonds that are broken and formed during the process. In this case, one C-H bond is broken, and one H-H bond is formed. The enthalpy change can be calculated using the bond dissociation energies:\n\nΔH = Σ(bond energies of bonds broken) - Σ(bond energies of bonds formed)\n\nIn this case, the enthalpy change is:\n\nΔH = (1 × 413 kJ/mol) - (1 × 436 kJ/mol) = -23 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can use this enthalpy change to find the standard enthalpy of formation for trans-2-butene. The relationship between the standard enthalpies of formation for cis- and trans-2-butene is:\n\nΔHf(trans-2-butene) = ΔHf(cis-2-butene) + ΔH(isomerization)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nΔHf(trans-2-butene) = -127.0 kJ/mol + (-23 kJ/mol) = -150 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy of formation for trans-2-butene is -150 kJ/mol."
