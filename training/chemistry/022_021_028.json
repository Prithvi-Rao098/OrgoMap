    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction, we can use the expression:\n\nKc = [N2O4] / [NO2]^2\n\nwhere [N2O4] is the concentration of N2O4 at equilibrium and [NO2] is the concentration of NO2 at equilibrium.\n\nGiven the concentrations of NO2(g) and N2O4(g) at equilibrium, we can plug the values into the expression:\n\nKc = (0.45 M) / (0.15 M)^2\n\nKc = 0.45 / 0.0225\n\nKc = 20\n\nThe equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction 2NO2(g) <=> N2O4(g) at the given temperature is 20."
