    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy of formation of methane (ΔHf°), we need to consider the standard enthalpy of combustion of methane (ΔHc°) and the standard enthalpy of formation of the products and reactants involved in the combustion reaction.\n\nThe combustion reaction of methane is:\n\nCH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(l)\n\nGiven: ΔHc°(CH4) = -890.4 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation of the products and reactants are:\n\nΔHf°(CH4) = ? (This is what we need to find)\nΔHf°(C(s)) = 0 kJ/mol (by definition, for elements in their standard state)\nΔHf°(H2(g)) = 0 kJ/mol (by definition, for elements in their standard state)\nΔHf°(O2(g)) = 0 kJ/mol (by definition, for elements in their standard state)\nΔHf°(CO2(g)) = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(H2O(l)) = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nUsing Hess's Law, we can write the equation for the standard enthalpy of combustion as:\n\nΔHc°(CH4) = [ΔHf°(CO2) + 2ΔHf°(H2O)] - ΔHf°(CH4)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values and solve for ΔHf°(CH4):\n\n-890.4 kJ/mol = [-393.5 kJ/mol + 2(-285.8 kJ/mol)] - ΔHf°(CH4)\n\n-890.4 kJ/mol = [-393.5 kJ/mol - 571.6 kJ/mol] - ΔHf°(CH4)\n\n-890.4 kJ/mol = -965.1 kJ/mol - ΔHf°(CH4)\n\nΔHf°(CH4) = -965.1 kJ/mol + 890.4 kJ/mol\n\nΔHf°(CH4) = -74.7 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy of formation of methane (CH4) gas at standard conditions (298 K and 1 atm) is -74.7 kJ/mol."
