    "message_2": "The balanced chemical equation for the preparation of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene from nitrobenzene and chlorine gas is:\n\nC6H5NO2 + 2 Cl2 → C6H3Cl2NO2 + 2 HCl\n\nTo determine the amount of each reactant required to produce 50g of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene, we will use stoichiometry.\n\nFirst, we need to find the molar mass of each compound:\n- Nitrobenzene (C6H5NO2): (6 × 12.01) + (5 × 1.01) + 14.01 + (2 × 16.00) = 123.11 g/mol\n- Chlorine gas (Cl2): 2 × 35.45 = 70.90 g/mol\n- 2,4-Dichloronitrobenzene (C6H3Cl2NO2): (6 × 12.01) + (3 × 1.01) + (2 × 35.45) + 14.01 + (2 × 16.00) = 197.00 g/mol\n\nNow, we can use stoichiometry to find the amount of each reactant needed:\n\n1. Calculate the moles of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene needed:\n50 g C6H3Cl2NO2 × (1 mol C6H3Cl2NO2 / 197.00 g C6H3Cl2NO2) = 0.254 mol C6H3Cl2NO2\n\n2. Use the balanced equation to find the moles of nitrobenzene and chlorine gas needed:\n0.254 mol C6H3Cl2NO2 × (1 mol C6H5NO2 / 1 mol C6H3Cl2NO2) = 0.254 mol C6H5NO2\n0.254 mol C6H3Cl2NO2 × (2 mol Cl2 / 1 mol C6H3Cl2NO2) = 0.508 mol Cl2\n\n3. Convert moles of each reactant to grams:\n0.254 mol C6H5NO2 × (123.11 g C6H5NO2 / 1 mol C6H5NO2) = 31.27 g C6H5NO2\n0.508 mol Cl2 × (70.90 g Cl2 / 1 mol Cl2) = 36.02 g Cl2\n\nSo, to produce 50g of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene, you will need 31.27g of nitrobenzene and 36.02g of chlorine gas."
