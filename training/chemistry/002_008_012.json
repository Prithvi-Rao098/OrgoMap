    "message_2": "To find the percent composition of MgSO4 (magnesium sulfate), we first need to determine the molar mass of each element in the compound and then calculate the percentage of each element.\n\n1. Determine the molar mass of each element in the compound:\n- Magnesium (Mg): 24.305 g/mol\n- Sulfur (S): 32.07 g/mol\n- Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol\n\n2. Calculate the molar mass of MgSO4:\nMgSO4 = Mg + S + (4 × O)\nMgSO4 = 24.305 g/mol + 32.07 g/mol + (4 × 16.00 g/mol)\nMgSO4 = 24.305 g/mol + 32.07 g/mol + 64.00 g/mol\nMgSO4 = 120.375 g/mol\n\n3. Calculate the percent composition of each element in MgSO4:\n- Magnesium (Mg): (24.305 g/mol ÷ 120.375 g/mol) × 100% = 20.19%\n- Sulfur (S): (32.07 g/mol ÷ 120.375 g/mol) × 100% = 26.64%\n- Oxygen (O): (64.00 g/mol ÷ 120.375 g/mol) × 100% = 53.17%\n\nSo, the percent composition of MgSO4 is approximately:\n- Magnesium (Mg): 20.19%\n- Sulfur (S): 26.64%\n- Oxygen (O): 53.17%"
