The specific heat capacity of ice is 2.06 J/goC, the specific heat capacity of water is 4.18 J/goC, and the enthalpy of fusion for ice is 6.01 kJ/mol.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the total amount of heat released, we need to consider three steps:\n\n1. Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C\n2. Melting the ice at 0°C\n3. Heating the liquid water from 0°C to 20°C\n\nStep 1: Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C\nq1 = mass x specific heat capacity of ice x temperature change\nq1 = 50 g x 2.06 J/g°C x (0 - (-10))°C\nq1 = 50 x 2.06 x 10\nq1 = 1030 J\n\nStep 2: Melting the ice at 0°C\nFirst, we need to calculate the number of moles of ice:\nn = mass / molar mass of water\nn = 50 g / 18.015 g/mol\nn = 2.776 moles\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat released during melting:\nq2 = moles x enthalpy of fusion\nq2 = 2.776 mol x 6.01 kJ/mol\nq2 = 16.68 kJ\nConvert kJ to J:\nq2 = 16.68 kJ x 1000 J/kJ\nq2 = 16680 J\n\nStep 3: Heating the liquid water from 0°C to 20°C\nq3 = mass x specific heat capacity of water x temperature change\nq3 = 50 g x 4.18 J/g°C x (20 - 0)°C\nq3 = 50 x 4.18 x 20\nq3 = 4180 J\n\nNow, we can find the total amount of heat released by adding the heat released in each step:\nq_total = q1 + q2 + q3\nq_total = 1030 J + 16680 J + 4180 J\nq_total = 21890 J\n\nSo, the amount of heat released when 50 grams of ice at a temperature of -10°C is converted to liquid water at a temperature of 20°C is 21,890 J."
