    "message_2": "To calculate the formal charge of nitrogen in the nitrogen dioxide (NO2) molecule, we will use the following formula:\n\nFormal charge = (Valence electrons of the atom) - (Non-bonding electrons) - (1/2 x Bonding electrons)\n\nFirst, let's determine the number of valence electrons, non-bonding electrons, and bonding electrons for nitrogen in NO2.\n\n1. Valence electrons of nitrogen (N): Nitrogen is in group 15 of the periodic table, so it has 5 valence electrons.\n\n2. Non-bonding electrons: In the NO2 molecule, nitrogen forms two bonds, one with each oxygen atom. One of these bonds is a double bond, and the other is a single bond. Nitrogen does not have any non-bonding (lone pair) electrons in NO2.\n\n3. Bonding electrons: Nitrogen forms one double bond (2 pairs of electrons) and one single bond (1 pair of electrons) in NO2. So, there are a total of 3 pairs of bonding electrons, which means there are 6 bonding electrons.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nFormal charge of N = (5) - (0) - (1/2 x 6)\nFormal charge of N = 5 - 0 - 3\nFormal charge of N = 2\n\nTherefore, the formal charge of nitrogen in the nitrogen dioxide (NO2) molecule is +1."
