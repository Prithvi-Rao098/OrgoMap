    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Hess's Law, we need to manipulate the given reactions and their enthalpy changes to match the desired reaction. The desired reaction is:\n\n2 CH4 + 4 O2 → 2 CO2 + 4 H2O\n\nFirst, we need to break down the methane (CH4) into its constituent elements:\n\nCH4 → C + 2 H2\n\nHowever, we don't have the enthalpy change for this reaction. We can obtain it by manipulating the given reactions.\n\nWe can start by reversing the reaction ΔH2:\n\nCO2 → C + O2 (ΔH = +394 kJ/mol)\n\nNext, we need to multiply the reaction ΔH3 by 2 to get 2 moles of H2O:\n\n2 (H2 + (1/2)O2 → H2O) (ΔH = 2 * -286 kJ/mol = -572 kJ/mol)\n\nNow, we can add the reversed ΔH2 and the multiplied ΔH3:\n\nCO2 → C + O2 (ΔH = +394 kJ/mol)\n2 (H2 + (1/2)O2 → H2O) (ΔH = -572 kJ/mol)\n-----------------------------------------------\nC + 2 H2 + O2 → CO2 + 2 H2O (ΔH = -178 kJ/mol)\n\nThis reaction represents the breakdown of methane into its constituent elements and their subsequent reaction with oxygen to form CO2 and H2O. Now, we can multiply this reaction by 2 to match the desired reaction:\n\n2 (C + 2 H2 + O2 → CO2 + 2 H2O) (ΔH = 2 * -178 kJ/mol = -356 kJ/mol)\n\nFinally, we have the enthalpy change for the desired reaction:\n\n2 CH4 + 4 O2 → 2 CO2 + 4 H2O (ΔH = -356 kJ/mol)"
