    "message_1": "What is the reaction rate of the decomposition of 1.25 grams of potassium chlorate (KClO3) into potassium chloride (KCl) and oxygen (O2) gas in 60 seconds, if the initial weight of the mixture containing potassium chlorate and the catalyst is 12 grams? The reaction is catalyzed by manganese dioxide (MnO2) and the equation for the reaction is:\n2KClO3(s) → 2KCl(s) + 3O2(g)",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the moles of potassium chlorate (KClO3) in the 1.25 grams sample. The molar mass of KClO3 is:\n\nK = 39.1 g/mol\nCl = 35.45 g/mol\nO = 16 g/mol\n\nMolar mass of KClO3 = 39.1 + 35.45 + (3 × 16) = 122.55 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the moles of KClO3:\n\nmoles of KClO3 = mass / molar mass\nmoles of KClO3 = 1.25 g / 122.55 g/mol = 0.0102 mol\n\nAccording to the balanced equation, 2 moles of KClO3 decompose to produce 3 moles of O2. So, we can find the moles of O2 produced:\n\nmoles of O2 = (3/2) × moles of KClO3\nmoles of O2 = (3/2) × 0.0102 mol = 0.0153 mol\n\nNow, we can find the mass of O2 produced using the molar mass of O2:\n\nMolar mass of O2 = 2 × 16 g/mol = 32 g/mol\n\nmass of O2 = moles of O2 × molar mass of O2\nmass of O2 = 0.0153 mol × 32 g/mol = 0.4896 g\n\nSince the reaction takes place in 60 seconds, we can now find the reaction rate:\n\nReaction rate = (mass of O2 produced) / (time taken)\nReaction rate = 0.4896 g / 60 s = 0.00816 g/s\n\nThe reaction rate of the decomposition of potassium chlorate into potassium chloride and oxygen gas is 0.00816 g/s."
