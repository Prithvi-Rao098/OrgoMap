    "message_2": "The electronegativity difference between a carbon atom (2.55) and a hydrogen atom (2.20) in a methane molecule can be calculated by subtracting the electronegativity of hydrogen from that of carbon:\n\nElectronegativity difference = Carbon electronegativity - Hydrogen electronegativity\nElectronegativity difference = 2.55 - 2.20\nElectronegativity difference = 0.35\n\nSo, the electronegativity difference between carbon and hydrogen in a methane molecule is 0.35."
