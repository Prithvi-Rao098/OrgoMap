    "message_2": "The VSEPR geometry of a molecule of carbon dioxide (CO2) is linear. In CO2, the central carbon atom is double-bonded to two oxygen atoms. There are no lone pairs on the central carbon atom, so the electron groups around the carbon atom are arranged in a linear shape, with a bond angle of 180 degrees."
