    "message_1": "What is the specific heat capacity of a substance if it absorbs 500 J of heat energy and its temperature increases by 10°C? Provide your answer in units of J/g°C.",
    "message_2": "To find the specific heat capacity (c) of a substance, we can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat energy absorbed (500 J), m is the mass of the substance, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature (10°C). \n\nHowever, the mass of the substance is not provided in the problem. To find the specific heat capacity in units of J/g°C, we can rearrange the formula as follows:\n\nc = q / (mΔT)\n\nSince the mass is not provided, we cannot calculate the specific heat capacity for this specific substance. If more information is given, we can solve the problem."
