    "message_1": "A student prepares a coordination compound [CoBr(NH3)5]SO4 by reacting cobalt(II) sulfate with ammonium bromide and ammonia. However, the student finds that there are two possible products formed in the reaction. Explain the type of isomerism present in the coordination compound and identify the two isomers formed by the student.",
    "message_2": "The type of isomerism present in the coordination compound [CoBr(NH3)5]SO4 is called linkage isomerism. Linkage isomerism occurs when the ligand can bind to the central metal atom through different donor atoms, resulting in different isomers.\n\nIn this case, the two isomers formed by the student are:\n\n1. [CoBr(NH3)5]SO4: In this isomer, the bromide ion (Br-) is directly bonded to the cobalt(II) ion as a ligand, and the sulfate ion (SO4^2-) is present as a counterion outside the coordination sphere.\n\n2. [Co(NH3)5SO4]Br: In this isomer, the sulfate ion (SO4^2-) is directly bonded to the cobalt(II) ion as a ligand, and the bromide ion (Br-) is present as a counterion outside the coordination sphere.\n\nBoth isomers have the same chemical formula but differ in the way the ligands are attached to the central metal ion, which results in different chemical and physical properties."
