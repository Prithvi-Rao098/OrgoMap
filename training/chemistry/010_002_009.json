    "message_2": "The oxidation state of sulfur in H2SO4 can be determined by assigning oxidation numbers to each element in the compound and then solving for the unknown oxidation state of sulfur (S).\n\n1. Hydrogen (H) has an oxidation state of +1.\n2. Oxygen (O) has an oxidation state of -2.\n\nNow, set up an equation using the oxidation states and the number of each element in the compound:\n\n2(+1) + 1(S) + 4(-2) = 0\n\nSolve for the oxidation state of sulfur (S):\n\n2 + S - 8 = 0\nS - 6 = 0\nS = +6\n\nThe oxidation state of sulfur in H2SO4 is +6."
