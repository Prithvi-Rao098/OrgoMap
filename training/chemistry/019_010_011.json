    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of 1 mole of propane gas, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH_combustion = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH_combustion is the standard enthalpy change for the combustion reaction, ΔH_f(products) is the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of the products, and ΔH_f(reactants) is the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of the reactants.\n\nFor the given balanced chemical equation:\n\nC3H8(g) + 5O2(g) -> 3CO2(g) + 4H2O(l)\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation values at 298K are:\n\nC3H8(g): -103.8 kJ/mol\nCO2(g): -393.5 kJ/mol\nH2O(l): -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nFirst, we calculate the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of the products:\n\n3 * (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 4 * (-285.8 kJ/mol) = -1180.5 kJ/mol - 1143.2 kJ/mol = -2323.7 kJ/mol\n\nNext, we calculate the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of the reactants:\n\n1 * (-103.8 kJ/mol) + 5 * 0 kJ/mol = -103.8 kJ/mol\n\nNote that the standard enthalpy of formation of O2(g) is 0 kJ/mol because it is an element in its standard state.\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard enthalpy change for the combustion reaction:\n\nΔH_combustion = -2323.7 kJ/mol - (-103.8 kJ/mol) = -2219.9 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of 1 mole of propane gas is -2219.9 kJ/mol."
