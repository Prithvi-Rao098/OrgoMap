    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction, we can use the expression:\n\nKc = [N2O4] / [NO2]^2\n\nGiven the concentrations of NO2 and N2O4 at equilibrium, we can plug in the values:\n\nKc = [0.20 M] / [0.10 M]^2\n\nKc = 0.20 / 0.01\n\nKc = 20\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction at 25°C is 20."
