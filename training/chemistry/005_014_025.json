    "message_2": "Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts glucose (C6H12O6) into pyruvate (CH3COCOO− + H+). During this process, a net yield of 2 ATP molecules is produced per glucose molecule. Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm of cells and consists of 10 enzyme-catalyzed reactions, which can be divided into two main phases: the energy investment phase and the energy generation phase.\n\n1. Energy Investment Phase:\n\nStep 1: Phosphorylation of glucose\nGlucose is phosphorylated by hexokinase to form glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). This step consumes 1 ATP molecule.\nReaction: Glucose + ATP → Glucose-6-phosphate + ADP\n\nStep 2: Isomerization of glucose-6-phosphate\nGlucose-6-phosphate is converted to its isomer, fructose-6-phosphate (F6P), by the enzyme phosphoglucose isomerase.\nReaction: Glucose-6-phosphate → Fructose-6-phosphate\n\nStep 3: Phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate\nFructose-6-phosphate is phosphorylated by phosphofructokinase to form fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (F1,6BP). This step consumes another ATP molecule.\nReaction: Fructose-6-phosphate + ATP → Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate + ADP\n\nStep 4: Cleavage of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate\nFructose-1,6-bisphosphate is cleaved by aldolase into two 3-carbon molecules: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP).\n\nReaction: Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate → Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate + Dihydroxyacetone phosphate\n\nStep 5: Interconversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate\nDihydroxyacetone phosphate is converted to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate by the enzyme triose phosphate isomerase.\nReaction: Dihydroxyacetone phosphate ↔ Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate\n\n2. Energy Generation Phase:\n\nStep 6: Oxidation and phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate\nGlyceraldehyde-3-phosphate is oxidized and phosphorylated by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase to form 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3BPG). This step generates 2 NADH molecules (one per G3P).\nReaction: 2 Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate + 2 NAD+ + 2 Pi → 2 1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate + 2 NADH + 2 H+\n\nStep 7: Phosphoryl transfer\n1,3-bisphosphoglycerate transfers a phosphate group to ADP, forming 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG) and ATP. This step generates 2 ATP molecules (one per 1,3BPG).\nReaction: 2 1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate + 2 ADP → 2 3-Phosphoglycerate + 2 ATP\n\nStep 8: Isomerization of 3-phosphoglycerate\n3-phosphoglycerate is converted to 2-phosphoglycerate (2PG) by the enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase.\nReaction: 2 3-Phosphoglycerate → 2 2-Phosphoglycerate\n\nStep 9: Dehydration of 2-phosphoglycerate\n2-phosphoglycerate is dehydrated by enolase to form phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP).\nReaction: 2 2-Phosphoglycerate → 2 Phosphoenolpyruvate + 2 H2O\n\nStep 10: Phosphoryl transfer\nPhosphoenolpyruvate transfers a phosphate group to ADP, forming pyruvate and ATP. This step generates 2 ATP molecules (one per PEP).\nReaction: 2 Phosphoenolpyruvate + 2 ADP → 2 Pyruvate + 2 ATP\n\nIn summary, glycolysis produces a net yield of 2 ATP molecules, 2 NADH molecules, and 2 pyruvate molecules per glucose molecule. The energy investment phase consumes 2 ATP molecules, while the energy generation phase produces 4 ATP molecules, resulting in a net gain of 2 ATP molecules."
