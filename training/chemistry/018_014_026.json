    "message_2": "To determine the reaction order with respect to [A] and [B], we can compare the initial rates and concentrations of the experiments.\n\nFirst, let's find the reaction order with respect to [A]. Compare Experiment 1 and Experiment 2, where [B]0 is constant:\n\n(2.0 x 10^-2 M/s) / (5.0 x 10^-3 M/s) = ([A]0, Exp 2 / [A]0, Exp 1)^x\n4 = (0.2 M / 0.1 M)^x\n4 = 2^x\n\nx = 2\n\nSo, the reaction order with respect to [A] is 2.\n\nNow, let's find the reaction order with respect to [B]. Compare Experiment 1 and Experiment 3, where [A]0 is constant:\n\n(1.25 x 10^-2 M/s) / (5.0 x 10^-3 M/s) = ([B]0, Exp 3 / [B]0, Exp 1)^y\n2.5 = (0.4 M / 0.2 M)^y\n2.5 = 2^y\n\ny = ~1.32\n\nHowever, reaction orders are typically integers or simple fractions. In this case, we can approximate the reaction order with respect to [B] as 1.\n\nThe overall reaction order is the sum of the reaction orders with respect to [A] and [B]:\n\nOverall reaction order = 2 + 1 = 3"
