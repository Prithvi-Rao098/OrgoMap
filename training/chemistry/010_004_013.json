    "message_2": "To calculate the cell potential (E°cell) for the given reaction, we need to determine the reduction and oxidation half-reactions. The given standard reduction potentials are:\n\nCu2+(aq) + 2e- -> Cu(s), E°red = +0.34 V (reduction)\nAg+(aq) + e- -> Ag(s), E°red = +0.80 V (reduction)\n\nSince Cu(s) is being oxidized to Cu2+(aq) in the overall reaction, we need to reverse the first half-reaction:\n\nCu(s) -> Cu2+(aq) + 2e-, E°ox = -0.34 V (oxidation)\n\nNow, we can combine the oxidation and reduction half-reactions:\n\nCu(s) -> Cu2+(aq) + 2e- (oxidation)\n2(Ag+(aq) + e- -> Ag(s)) (reduction, multiplied by 2 to balance electrons)\n\nThe overall reaction is:\n\nCu(s) + 2Ag+(aq) -> Cu2+(aq) + 2Ag(s)\n\nNow, we can calculate the cell potential (E°cell) using the Nernst equation:\n\nE°cell = E°red(reduction) - E°ox(oxidation)\n\nE°cell = (+0.80 V) - (-0.34 V) = 0.80 V + 0.34 V = 1.14 V\n\nSo, the cell potential (E°cell) for the given reaction at 25°C is 1.14 V."
