    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the vaporization of 10 g of water at 100°C and atmospheric pressure, we need to use the following formula:\n\nΔH = m × ΔHvap\n\nwhere ΔH is the enthalpy change, m is the mass of water, and ΔHvap is the molar enthalpy of vaporization.\n\nThe molar enthalpy of vaporization for water at 100°C and atmospheric pressure is approximately 40.7 kJ/mol.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of water (10 g) to moles. The molar mass of water is 18.015 g/mol.\n\nmoles of water = mass / molar mass\nmoles of water = 10 g / 18.015 g/mol\nmoles of water ≈ 0.555 mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change:\n\nΔH = m × ΔHvap\nΔH = 0.555 mol × 40.7 kJ/mol\nΔH ≈ 22.6 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the vaporization of 10 g of water at 100°C and atmospheric pressure is approximately 22.6 kJ."
