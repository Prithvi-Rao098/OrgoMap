    "message_2": "The molecular geometry of the molecule SF6 (sulfur hexafluoride) is octahedral. In this geometry, the sulfur atom is at the center, and the six fluorine atoms are surrounding it, with each fluorine atom bonded to the central sulfur atom. The bond angles between the fluorine atoms are approximately 90 degrees."
