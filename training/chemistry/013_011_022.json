    "message_2": "The critical micelle concentration (CMC) of a surfactant like sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) is the concentration at which micelles begin to form in a solution. The CMC of SDS in water at room temperature (25°C) is approximately 8.2 mM.\n\nTo support this answer, we can refer to experimental data and the relationship between CMC and temperature. The CMC of SDS is known to decrease with increasing temperature, and the relationship can be described by the following equation:\n\nCMC(T) = CMC(T_ref) * (1 - K * (T - T_ref))\n\nwhere CMC(T) is the CMC at temperature T, CMC(T_ref) is the CMC at a reference temperature T_ref, K is a constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nFor SDS, the reference CMC value is 8.3 mM at 25°C (298.15 K), and the constant K is 2.1 x 10^-3 K^-1. Using this equation, we can calculate the CMC of SDS in water at room temperature (25°C or 298.15 K):\n\nCMC(298.15) = 8.3 mM * (1 - 2.1 x 10^-3 * (298.15 - 298.15))\nCMC(298.15) = 8.3 mM * (1 - 0)\nCMC(298.15) = 8.3 mM\n\nThe calculated CMC value is approximately 8.3 mM, which is close to the experimentally determined value of 8.2 mM. This slight discrepancy can be attributed to variations in experimental conditions and the simplicity of the equation used. Nonetheless, the calculated value supports the statement that the CMC of SDS in water at room temperature is approximately 8.2 mM."
