    "message_2": "When a solution of silver nitrate (AgNO3) is added to a solution of potassium hexacyanoferrate(II) (K4[Fe(CN)6]), a precipitation reaction occurs, forming silver hexacyanoferrate(II) (Ag4[Fe(CN)6]) and potassium nitrate (KNO3) as the products. The balanced equation for this reaction is:\n\n4 AgNO3(aq) + K4[Fe(CN)6](aq) â†’ Ag4[Fe(CN)6](s) + 4 KNO3(aq)\n\nIn this reaction, a ligand substitution does not occur. Instead, a precipitation reaction takes place, where the silver ions (Ag+) from the silver nitrate solution and the hexacyanoferrate(II) complex anions [Fe(CN)6]4- from the potassium hexacyanoferrate(II) solution combine to form the insoluble silver hexacyanoferrate(II) precipitate. The remaining potassium ions (K+) and nitrate ions (NO3-) stay in the solution as potassium nitrate."
