    "message_1": "What is the reaction quotient for the following chemical reaction at 25°C, with concentrations of products and reactants as follows:\n\n2NOBr(g) ⇌ 2NO(g) + Br2(g)\n\n[NO]^2[Br2] / [NOBr]^2",
    "message_2": "To calculate the reaction quotient (Q) for the given reaction, you need to know the concentrations of the products and reactants at a specific moment in time. The general formula for the reaction quotient is:\n\nQ = [Products] / [Reactants]\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\n2NOBr(g) ⇌ 2NO(g) + Br2(g)\n\nQ = [NO]^2[Br2] / [NOBr]^2\n\nPlease provide the concentrations of NO, Br2, and NOBr at 25°C to calculate the reaction quotient."
