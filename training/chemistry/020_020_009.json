    "message_2": "To calculate the new equilibrium constant (K') at 50°C, we can use the Van't Hoff equation:\n\nln(K'/K) = -ΔH/R * (1/T' - 1/T)\n\nwhere K is the equilibrium constant at 25°C (1.12 x 10^7), ΔH is the enthalpy change (48.2 kJ/mol), R is the gas constant (8.314 J/(mol.K)), T is the initial temperature in Kelvin (25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K), and T' is the final temperature in Kelvin (50°C + 273.15 = 323.15 K).\n\nFirst, convert ΔH to J/mol: 48.2 kJ/mol * 1000 J/kJ = 48200 J/mol\n\nNow, plug in the values into the Van't Hoff equation:\n\nln(K'/K) = -(48200 J/mol) / (8.314 J/(mol.K)) * (1/323.15 K - 1/298.15 K)\n\nln(K'/K) ≈ -11.64\n\nNow, solve for K':\n\nK' = K * e^(-11.64)\nK' = (1.12 x 10^7) * e^(-11.64)\nK' ≈ 1.57 x 10^6\n\nSo, the new equilibrium constant (K') for the reaction at 50°C is approximately 1.57 x 10^6. The formation of the complex ion decreases with increasing temperature, as the equilibrium constant is lower at 50°C compared to 25°C."
