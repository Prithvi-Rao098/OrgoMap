    "message_2": "The bond dissociation energy is the energy required to break a bond in a molecule. In this case, we are given that it requires 436 kJ/mol of energy to break one mole of H2 into individual H atoms. Since there is only one H-H bond in an H2 molecule, the bond dissociation energy of the H-H bond is equal to the energy required to break one mole of H2.\n\nTherefore, the bond dissociation energy of the H-H bond in H2 molecule is 436 kJ/mol."
