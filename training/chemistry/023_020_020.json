    "message_1": "How much benzoic acid (in grams) is needed to prepare 15 g of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid, assuming a 100% yield and excess chlorine gas?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use stoichiometry, which involves using the balanced chemical equation and the molecular weights of the compounds involved.\n\nFirst, let's write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nC6H5COOH (benzoic acid) + 2 Cl2 (chlorine gas) -> C6H3Cl2COOH (2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid)\n\nNext, we need to find the molecular weights of benzoic acid and 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid.\n\nBenzoic acid (C6H5COOH) has a molecular weight of:\n(12.01 * 7) + (1.01 * 6) + (16.00 * 2) = 84.07 + 6.06 + 32.00 = 122.13 g/mol\n\n2,4-Dichlorobenzoic acid (C6H3Cl2COOH) has a molecular weight of:\n(12.01 * 7) + (1.01 * 4) + (35.45 * 2) + (16.00 * 2) = 84.07 + 4.04 + 70.90 + 32.00 = 191.01 g/mol\n\nNow, we can use stoichiometry to find out how much benzoic acid is needed to prepare 15 g of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid.\n\n1 mol of benzoic acid produces 1 mol of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid (according to the balanced chemical equation).\n\nFirst, let's find out how many moles of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid are in 15 g:\n\nmoles = mass / molecular weight\nmoles of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid = 15 g / 191.01 g/mol = 0.0785 mol\n\nSince the ratio of benzoic acid to 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid is 1:1, we need the same number of moles of benzoic acid:\n\nmoles of benzoic acid = 0.0785 mol\n\nNow, let's find the mass of benzoic acid needed:\n\nmass = moles * molecular weight\nmass of benzoic acid = 0.0785 mol * 122.13 g/mol = 9.59 g\n\nSo, 9.59 grams of benzoic acid are needed to prepare 15 g of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid, assuming a 100% yield and excess chlorine gas."
