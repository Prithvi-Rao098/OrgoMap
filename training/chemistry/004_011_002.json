    "message_2": "Based on the given molecular formula (C5H10O2) and the 1H-NMR spectrum data, we can deduce the structure of the unknown compound as follows:\n\n1. The molecular formula C5H10O2 suggests the presence of an ester or a carboxylic acid with an additional oxygen-containing functional group (e.g., an ether or an alcohol).\n\n2. The presence of a singlet at δ 1.1 ppm indicates a methyl group (CH3) that is not adjacent to any other protons.\n\n3. The singlet at δ 2.3 ppm suggests a methylene group (CH2) that is not adjacent to any other protons.\n\n4. The singlet at δ 3.7 ppm indicates a methine group (CH) that is not adjacent to any other protons but is likely connected to an electronegative atom (e.g., oxygen).\n\n5. The doublet at δ 2.9 ppm suggests a methylene group (CH2) that is adjacent to another proton.\n\nTaking all this information into account, the most likely structure for the unknown compound is an ester with an ether group:\n\nCH3-O-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-O-CH3\n\nThis structure is consistent with the given 1H-NMR data and the molecular formula C5H10O2."
