    "message_2": "The molecule C6H5OH is phenol. The functional group present in phenol is the hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to a benzene ring.\n\nThe reaction between phenol (C6H5OH) and hydrobromic acid (HBr) is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. In this case, it is a bromination reaction where the hydroxyl group (-OH) in phenol is ortho/para-directing, meaning that the bromine atom will attach to either the ortho position (adjacent to the -OH group) or the para position (opposite to the -OH group) on the benzene ring. The detailed mechanism is as follows:\n\n1. Protonation of the hydroxyl group:\nThe lone pair of electrons on the oxygen atom of the hydroxyl group in phenol interacts with the hydrogen atom of HBr, forming a bond and resulting in the protonation of the hydroxyl group. This generates a good leaving group (H2O) and a positively charged oxygen atom.\n\nC6H5OH + HBr -> C6H5O(H2)⁺ + Br⁻\n\n2. Formation of the resonance-stabilized carbocation:\nThe positively charged oxygen atom pulls electrons from the oxygen-hydrogen bond, causing the water molecule to leave and generating a resonance-stabilized carbocation (a positively charged carbon atom) at the ortho and para positions of the benzene ring.\n\nC6H5O(H2)⁺ -> C6H5⁺ (resonance-stabilized) + H2O\n\n3. Nucleophilic attack by bromide ion:\nThe negatively charged bromide ion (Br⁻) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the resonance-stabilized carbocation at either the ortho or para positions, forming a new carbon-bromine bond.\n\nC6H5⁺ (resonance-stabilized) + Br⁻ -> C6H4BrOH (ortho- or para-bromophenol)\n\nThe final products of this reaction are ortho-bromophenol and para-bromophenol, along with water as a byproduct."
