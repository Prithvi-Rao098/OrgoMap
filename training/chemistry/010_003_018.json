    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG = ΔG(products) - ΔG(reactants)\n\nFor the reactants, we have Mg(s) and 2H+(aq), and for the products, we have Mg2+(aq) and H2(g). Using the given standard Gibbs free energy change of formation values:\n\nΔG(reactants) = 0 kJ/mol (Mg) + 2 * 0 kJ/mol (H+) = 0 kJ/mol\nΔG(products) = -466 kJ/mol (Mg2+) + 0 kJ/mol (H2) = -466 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the Gibbs free energy change for the reaction:\n\nΔG = ΔG(products) - ΔG(reactants) = -466 kJ/mol - 0 kJ/mol = -466 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the Gibbs free energy change for the given electrochemical reaction at 298 K is -466 kJ/mol."
