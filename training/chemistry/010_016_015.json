    "message_2": "To determine the polarization of the cell, we first need to calculate the standard cell potential (E°) for the given reaction. The overall reaction in this cell is:\n\nZn(s) + Cu²⁺(aq) → Zn²⁺(aq) + Cu(s)\n\nThe standard reduction potentials for the half-reactions are:\n\nZn²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Zn(s)  E° = -0.76 V\nCu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Cu(s)  E° = +0.34 V\n\nTo obtain the overall cell potential, we add the standard reduction potentials:\n\nE°(cell) = E°(cathode) - E°(anode) = 0.34 V - (-0.76 V) = 1.10 V\n\nNow that we have the standard cell potential, we can compare it to the measured cell potential to determine the polarization. The polarization (P) is the difference between the measured potential (E) and the standard potential (E°):\n\nP = E - E°\n\nIn this case, the measured potential difference is given as 1.10 V, which is equal to the standard cell potential:\n\nP = 1.10 V - 1.10 V = 0 V\n\nTherefore, the polarization of the cell is 0 V. This means that there is no overpotential or concentration polarization affecting the cell, and the cell is operating at its standard conditions."
