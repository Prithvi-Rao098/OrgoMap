    "message_2": "To determine the activation energy (Ea) of the reaction between hydrogen peroxide and iodide ions, we can use the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk = A * exp(-Ea / (R * T))\n\nwhere:\nk = rate constant\nA = pre-exponential factor (frequency factor)\nEa = activation energy\nR = gas constant (8.314 J/molÂ·K)\nT = temperature in Kelvin\n\nTo find the activation energy, we need at least two sets of experimental data with rate constants (k) and temperatures (T). Please provide the experimental data, and I will help you calculate the activation energy."
