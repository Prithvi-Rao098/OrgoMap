    "message_2": "To determine the geometry and polarity of the sulfur tetrafluoride (SF4) molecule using the VSEPR theory, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the central atom: In SF4, sulfur (S) is the central atom.\n\n2. Count the total number of valence electrons: Sulfur has 6 valence electrons, and each fluorine atom has 7 valence electrons. So, the total number of valence electrons is 6 + (4 Ã— 7) = 34.\n\n3. Determine the electron pair geometry: In SF4, there are four bonding pairs (from the four S-F bonds) and one lone pair on the sulfur atom. This gives us a total of five electron pairs around the central sulfur atom. According to the VSEPR theory, five electron pairs will arrange themselves in a trigonal bipyramidal geometry.\n\n4. Determine the molecular geometry: Since there is one lone pair on the sulfur atom, the molecular geometry will be different from the electron pair geometry. The lone pair will occupy one of the equatorial positions in the trigonal bipyramidal arrangement, leading to a \"see-saw\" or \"distorted tetrahedron\" molecular geometry for SF4.\n\n5. Determine the polarity: Polarity depends on the electronegativity difference between the atoms and the molecular geometry. Fluorine is more electronegative than sulfur, so the S-F bonds are polar. Due to the asymmetrical arrangement of the fluorine atoms in the see-saw molecular geometry, the individual bond dipoles do not cancel each other out, resulting in a net molecular dipole moment. Therefore, SF4 is a polar molecule.\n\nIn summary, the sulfur tetrafluoride (SF4) molecule has a see-saw molecular geometry and is polar according to the VSEPR theory."
