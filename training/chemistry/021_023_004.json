    "message_2": "There are three possible isomers of C3H8O. These isomers are constitutional isomers, meaning they have the same molecular formula but different connectivity of atoms.\n\n1. Propanol (also called n-propanol or 1-propanol)\nStructural formula: CH3CH2CH2OH\nThis is a primary alcohol, where the hydroxyl group (-OH) is attached to a terminal carbon atom.\n\n2. Isopropanol (also called 2-propanol or isopropyl alcohol)\nStructural formula: CH3CHOHCH3\nThis is a secondary alcohol, where the hydroxyl group (-OH) is attached to a non-terminal carbon atom that is bonded to two other carbon atoms.\n\n3. Methoxyethane (also called ethyl methyl ether)\nStructural formula: CH3OCH2CH3\nThis is an ether, where an oxygen atom is connected to two carbon atoms.\n\nThese three isomers exhibit constitutional isomerism, as they have the same molecular formula (C3H8O) but different arrangements of atoms within their structures."
