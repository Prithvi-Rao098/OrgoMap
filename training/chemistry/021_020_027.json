    "message_2": "To calculate the heat of formation of methane (CH4) from its elements carbon (C) and hydrogen (H2), we can use the bond energy data provided. The heat of formation is the difference between the energy required to break the bonds in the reactants and the energy released when the bonds in the products are formed.\n\nMethane (CH4) has 4 C-H bonds. The formation of one molecule of CH4 requires breaking one H-H bond in H2 and forming four C-H bonds in CH4.\n\nEnergy required to break 1 H-H bond = 436 kJ/mol\nEnergy released when forming 1 C-H bond = 414 kJ/mol\n\nHeat of formation of CH4 = (Energy required to break bonds in reactants) - (Energy released when forming bonds in products)\n\nHeat of formation of CH4 = (1 * 436 kJ/mol) - (4 * 414 kJ/mol)\nHeat of formation of CH4 = 436 kJ/mol - 1656 kJ/mol\nHeat of formation of CH4 = -1220 kJ/mol\n\nThe heat of formation of methane (CH4) from its elements carbon (C) and hydrogen (H2) at standard conditions (25°C and 1 atm) is -1220 kJ/mol."
