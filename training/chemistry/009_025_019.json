    "message_2": "As a language model AI, I cannot analyze raw data from nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) experiments. However, I can help you interpret the data if you provide me with the specific information obtained from the MRS experiment, such as chemical shifts, coupling constants, and multiplicities. Based on that information, I can help you deduce the molecular structure and chemical composition of the unknown compound A."
