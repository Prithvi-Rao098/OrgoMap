    "message_2": "As an AI language model, I am unable to perform experiments or analyze experimental data directly. However, I can help guide you through the process of interpreting NMR data to determine the structure of a compound.\n\nTo determine the structure of Compound X using NMR spectroscopy, you would need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Obtain NMR spectra: You would need to acquire both 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra of the compound. These spectra will provide information about the hydrogen and carbon atoms present in the molecule.\n\n2. Analyze the 1H NMR spectrum: Examine the chemical shifts, splitting patterns, and integration values of the peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum. This information can help you identify the types of hydrogen atoms present in the molecule and their relative positions.\n\n3. Analyze the 13C NMR spectrum: Examine the chemical shifts of the peaks in the 13C NMR spectrum. This information can help you identify the types of carbon atoms present in the molecule and their functional groups.\n\n4. Identify functional groups: Based on the chemical shifts and splitting patterns observed in both the 1H and 13C NMR spectra, you can identify the functional groups present in the molecule. Common functional groups include alcohols, amines, carboxylic acids, esters, alkenes, and aromatic rings.\n\n5. Assemble the molecular structure: Using the information obtained from the NMR spectra, piece together the molecular structure of Compound X. This may involve some trial and error, and you may need to consider multiple possible structures before arriving at the correct one.\n\n6. Confirm the structure: Once you have proposed a structure for Compound X, you can use other spectroscopic techniques, such as infrared (IR) spectroscopy or mass spectrometry, to confirm the structure.\n\nIf you have specific NMR data for Compound X, please provide the data, and I can help you interpret it and propose a possible structure for the compound."
