    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic moment of Ni(CO)4, we first need to determine the electronic configuration of the central metal ion (Ni) and the ligands (CO) in the complex.\n\nNi is a transition metal with an atomic number of 28. Its ground state electronic configuration is [Ar] 3d^8 4s^2. In Ni(CO)4, Ni is in the +0 oxidation state, so its electronic configuration remains the same.\n\nCO is a strong field ligand and forms a σ-donor and π-acceptor bond with the metal ion. In this case, the molecular orbital theory (also known as Ligand Field Theory) is more appropriate to use than the crystal field theory.\n\nAccording to the molecular orbital theory, the five 3d orbitals of Ni and the ligand orbitals form bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals. The σ-donor interaction of CO with Ni leads to the formation of a2g and t2g orbitals, while the π-acceptor interaction leads to the formation of eg* orbitals.\n\nThe electronic configuration of Ni in Ni(CO)4 is [Ar] 3d^8. The eight d-electrons will fill the molecular orbitals as follows:\n\n1. Three t2g orbitals are filled with six electrons (two electrons per orbital).\n2. One a2g orbital is filled with two electrons.\n\nAll the d-electrons are paired in the molecular orbitals, and there are no unpaired electrons. Therefore, the magnetic moment of Ni(CO)4 is zero. This result indicates that Ni(CO)4 is diamagnetic, which means it has no net magnetic moment and does not interact with an external magnetic field."
