    "message_2": "When a barium nitrate (Ba(NO3)2) solution is mixed with a sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) solution, a double displacement reaction occurs. The products formed are barium sulfate (BaSO4) and sodium nitrate (NaNO3). Barium sulfate is a solid precipitate, while sodium nitrate remains in the aqueous solution. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nBa(NO3)2 (aq) + Na2SO4 (aq) â†’ BaSO4 (s) + 2 NaNO3 (aq)\n\nIn this equation, (aq) denotes an aqueous solution and (s) denotes a solid."
