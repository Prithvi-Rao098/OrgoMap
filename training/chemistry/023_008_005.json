    "message_1": "What is the yield of p-nitroaniline that can be obtained from the reaction between 10 grams of aniline and excess nitric acid under the given conditions of the preparation process?",
    "message_2": "To determine the yield of p-nitroaniline, we need to first find the limiting reagent, which in this case is aniline since nitric acid is in excess. Then, we can use stoichiometry to calculate the theoretical yield of p-nitroaniline. Finally, we can apply the percentage yield (if provided) to find the actual yield.\n\n1. Find the moles of aniline:\nAniline (C6H5NH2) has a molar mass of (6x12.01) + (5x1.01) + 14.01 + 2x1.01 = 93.13 g/mol.\nMoles of aniline = mass / molar mass = 10 g / 93.13 g/mol = 0.107 moles.\n\n2. Stoichiometry:\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\nC6H5NH2 + HNO3 -> C6H5N(NO2)H + H2O\n\nFrom the balanced equation, 1 mole of aniline reacts with 1 mole of nitric acid to produce 1 mole of p-nitroaniline. Therefore, the moles of p-nitroaniline produced will be equal to the moles of aniline.\n\n3. Calculate the theoretical yield of p-nitroaniline:\np-nitroaniline (C6H5N(NO2)H) has a molar mass of (6x12.01) + (5x1.01) + 14.01 + 3x16.00 + 1.01 = 138.12 g/mol.\nTheoretical yield = moles of p-nitroaniline x molar mass = 0.107 moles x 138.12 g/mol = 14.78 g.\n\nIf the percentage yield is provided, we can calculate the actual yield as follows:\nActual yield = (percentage yield / 100) x theoretical yield\n\nHowever, since the percentage yield is not provided in the given conditions, we can only report the theoretical yield of p-nitroaniline, which is 14.78 grams."
