    "message_2": "To find the minimum amount of Cobalt-60 needed to deliver a radiation dose of 6 Gy to a patient, we need to use the following formula:\n\nDose (Gy) = Activity (Bq) × Time (s) × Energy (J) × Conversion factor / (4 × π × Distance² (m²))\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given activity from GBq to Bq:\n\nActivity = 120 GBq × (10^9 Bq/1 GBq) = 1.2 × 10^11 Bq\n\nNext, we need to convert the treatment time from minutes to seconds:\n\nTime = 10 minutes × (60 s/1 min) = 600 s\n\nThe energy released per disintegration of Cobalt-60 is approximately 2.5 MeV. We need to convert this to Joules:\n\nEnergy = 2.5 MeV × (1.602 × 10^-13 J/1 MeV) = 4.005 × 10^-13 J\n\nThe conversion factor for Cobalt-60 is 0.97.\n\nNow we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\n6 Gy = (1.2 × 10^11 Bq) × (600 s) × (4.005 × 10^-13 J) × 0.97 / (4 × π × (1 m)²)\n\n6 Gy = (2.886 × 10^14) × 0.97 / (4 × π)\n\nNow we solve for the activity:\n\nActivity = 6 Gy × (4 × π) / 0.97 = 77.97 × 10^14 Bq\n\nNow we need to find the mass of Cobalt-60 needed to achieve this activity. The half-life of Cobalt-60 is 5.27 years, and we can use the following formula to find the decay constant (λ):\n\nλ = ln(2) / Half-life = 0.693 / (5.27 years × 3.154 × 10^7 s/year) = 4.19 × 10^-9 s^-1\n\nNow we can find the number of Cobalt-60 atoms (N) needed to achieve the desired activity:\n\nActivity = λ × N\n\nN = Activity / λ = (77.97 × 10^14 Bq) / (4.19 × 10^-9 s^-1) = 1.86 × 10^24 atoms\n\nFinally, we can find the mass of Cobalt-60 needed using the molar mass and Avogadro's number:\n\nMass = N × (Molar mass / Avogadro's number) = (1.86 × 10^24 atoms) × (58.93 g/mol / 6.022 × 10^23 atoms/mol) = 181.2 g\n\nTherefore, the minimum amount of Cobalt-60 needed to deliver a radiation dose of 6 Gy to a patient under the given conditions is approximately 181.2 grams."
