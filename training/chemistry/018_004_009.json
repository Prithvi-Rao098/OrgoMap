    "message_2": "To determine the activation energy (Ea) of the reaction, we can use the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk = Ae^(-Ea/RT)\n\nwhere k is the rate constant, A is the pre-exponential factor, Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin:\n\n25°C = 298 K\n35°C = 308 K\n45°C = 318 K\n55°C = 328 K\n65°C = 338 K\n\nNext, we can choose two data points to create a ratio of the rate constants:\n\nk1 = 0.0017 M/s at 298 K\nk2 = 0.011 M/s at 308 K\n\nNow, we can set up the ratio using the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk2/k1 = e^(-Ea/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1))\n\n0.011/0.0017 = e^(-Ea/8.314 * (1/308 - 1/298))\n\n6.47 = e^(-Ea/8.314 * (-0.00323))\n\nNow, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(6.47) = -Ea/8.314 * (-0.00323)\n\n1.866 = Ea * 0.000388\n\nFinally, we can solve for Ea:\n\nEa = 1.866 / 0.000388\n\nEa ≈ 4805 J/mol\n\nThe activation energy of the reaction between hydrogen peroxide and iodide ions is approximately 4805 J/mol."
