(Assume concentration polarization effects to be negligible.)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the exchange current density (i0) for the Zinc electrode, we can use the Butler-Volmer equation:\n\ni0 = n * F * A * k0 * (C_red)^α * (C_ox)^(1-α)\n\nwhere:\nn = number of electrons transferred in the half-reaction (for Zn, n = 2)\nF = Faraday's constant (96485 C/mol)\nA = electrode surface area (we will assume it to be 1 cm² for simplicity)\nk0 = standard rate constant (we will assume it to be 10^-7 cm/s for simplicity)\nC_red = concentration of reduced species (0.1 M for Zn²⁺ ions)\nC_ox = concentration of oxidized species (1 M for Zn metal, as it is in its pure form)\nα = transfer coefficient (0.5)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate i0:\n\ni0 = 2 * 96485 * 1 * 10^-7 * (0.1)^0.5 * (1)^(1-0.5)\ni0 = 192970 * 10^-7 * 0.3162\ni0 = 6.097 * 10^-5 A/cm²\n\nSo, the exchange current density for the Zinc electrode immersed in a solution containing 0.1 M Zinc ions at 25 degrees Celsius is approximately 6.097 * 10^-5 A/cm²."
