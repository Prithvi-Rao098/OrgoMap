    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat released, we can use the stoichiometry of the balanced equation and the given enthalpy change (∆H) for the reaction.\n\nThe balanced equation tells us that 1 mole of propane (C3H8) reacts to release -2220 kJ of heat. We are given 0.5 moles of propane, so we can set up a proportion to find the heat released:\n\n(Heat released) / (0.5 moles of C3H8) = -2220 kJ/mol / (1 mole of C3H8)\n\nNow, we can solve for the heat released:\n\nHeat released = (0.5 moles of C3H8) * (-2220 kJ/mol)\n\nHeat released = -1110 kJ\n\nSo, the amount of heat released when 0.5 moles of propane combust completely in oxygen gas is -1110 kJ. The negative sign indicates that the reaction is exothermic, meaning heat is released."
