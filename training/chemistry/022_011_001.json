    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first need to determine the number of moles of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) that are present in 5 grams. Then, we will use stoichiometry to determine the number of moles of carbon dioxide (CO2) produced. Finally, we will convert the moles of CO2 to volume at STP.\n\n1. Calculate the number of moles of CaCO3:\nThe molar mass of CaCO3 is 40.08 (Ca) + 12.01 (C) + 3 * 16.00 (O) = 100.09 g/mol.\nNumber of moles of CaCO3 = (5 g) / (100.09 g/mol) = 0.0499 mol\n\n2. Use stoichiometry to determine the number of moles of CO2 produced:\nFrom the balanced equation, 1 mol of CaCO3 produces 1 mol of CO2.\nSo, 0.0499 mol of CaCO3 will produce 0.0499 mol of CO2.\n\n3. Convert moles of CO2 to volume at STP:\nAt STP (standard temperature and pressure), 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\nVolume of CO2 produced = (0.0499 mol) * (22.4 L/mol) = 1.12 L\n\nTherefore, 1.12 liters of carbon dioxide gas is produced at STP when 5 grams of calcium carbonate react with excess hydrochloric acid."
