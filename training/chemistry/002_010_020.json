    "message_2": "To find the density of a substance, we can use the formula:\n\nDensity = mass/volume\n\nGiven the mass of aluminum sulfate pentahydrate (Al2(SO4)3.5H2O) is 25 g and its volume is 15 mL, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nDensity = (25 g) / (15 mL)\n\nDensity = 1.67 g/mL\n\nThe density of the aluminum sulfate pentahydrate at 25°C is 1.67 g/mL."
