    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy of formation of carbon dioxide (CO2), we can use the given information about the enthalpy of combustion of graphite and the standard enthalpy of formation of the reactants.\n\nThe combustion reaction of graphite can be written as:\n\nC(graphite) + O2(g) → CO2(g)\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for this reaction (ΔH°) is equal to the enthalpy of combustion of graphite:\n\nΔH° = -393.5 kJ/mol\n\nSince the standard enthalpy of formation of graphite and oxygen gas are both 0 kJ/mol, we can write the standard enthalpy change for the reaction as:\n\nΔH° = ΔHf°(CO2) - [ΔHf°(C) + ΔHf°(O2)]\n\nWhere ΔHf°(CO2) is the standard enthalpy of formation of CO2, ΔHf°(C) is the standard enthalpy of formation of graphite, and ΔHf°(O2) is the standard enthalpy of formation of oxygen gas.\n\nSubstituting the given values, we have:\n\n-393.5 kJ/mol = ΔHf°(CO2) - [0 kJ/mol + 0 kJ/mol]\n\nSolving for ΔHf°(CO2):\n\nΔHf°(CO2) = -393.5 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy of formation of carbon dioxide is -393.5 kJ/mol."
