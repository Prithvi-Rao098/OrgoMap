    "message_2": "In H₂SO₄ (sulfuric acid), the oxidation state of sulfur can be determined by considering the oxidation states of the other elements in the compound and the overall charge of the molecule.\n\nHydrogen (H) has an oxidation state of +1, and there are two hydrogen atoms, so the total oxidation state for hydrogen is +2.\n\nOxygen (O) has an oxidation state of -2, and there are four oxygen atoms, so the total oxidation state for oxygen is -8.\n\nThe overall charge of the molecule is 0, as it is a neutral compound.\n\nNow, let's denote the oxidation state of sulfur as x. According to the oxidation state rules, the sum of the oxidation states of all elements in the compound should equal the overall charge of the molecule:\n\n(+2) + x + (-8) = 0\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx - 6 = 0\n\nx = +6\n\nSo, the oxidation state of sulfur in H₂SO₄ is +6."
