    "message_2": "To calculate the efficiency of the electrochemical cell, we need to compare the actual cell potential under operating conditions to the standard cell potential. Efficiency is defined as the ratio of the actual cell potential to the standard cell potential, multiplied by 100 to express it as a percentage.\n\nEfficiency = (Actual cell potential / Standard cell potential) × 100\n\nIn this case, the standard cell potential is +0.80 V, and the actual cell potential under operating conditions is +0.60 V.\n\nEfficiency = (0.60 V / 0.80 V) × 100\n\nEfficiency = 0.75 × 100\n\nEfficiency = 75%\n\nSo, the efficiency of the electrochemical cell is 75%."
