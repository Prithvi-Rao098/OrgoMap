    "message_2": "The overall ATP yield per glucose molecule metabolized in the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation can be broken down as follows:\n\n1. Glycolysis: 2 ATP (net gain)\n2. Pyruvate decarboxylation: 2 NADH (each NADH generates ~2.5 ATP in oxidative phosphorylation)\n3. Citric acid cycle: 6 NADH, 2 FADH2, and 2 ATP (each FADH2 generates ~1.5 ATP in oxidative phosphorylation)\n\nSo, the total ATP yield is calculated as:\n2 (from glycolysis) + 2 (from citric acid cycle) + 2.5 * 10 (from 10 NADH) + 1.5 * 2 (from 2 FADH2) = 38 ATP (in eukaryotes) or 36 ATP (in prokaryotes, due to differences in transport mechanisms).\n\nElectron transport chain (ETC) inhibitors can influence the energy yield by blocking the flow of electrons through the ETC, which in turn disrupts the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This prevents ATP synthesis through oxidative phosphorylation, as the proton gradient is essential for ATP synthase to function.\n\nThere are different types of ETC inhibitors, and they can affect the ATP yield in different ways:\n\n1. Complex I inhibitors (e.g., rotenone, piericidin A): These inhibitors block the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, reducing the ATP yield by preventing the generation of ATP from NADH.\n\n2. Complex III inhibitors (e.g., antimycin A, myxothiazol): These inhibitors block the transfer of electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c, reducing the ATP yield by preventing the generation of ATP from both NADH and FADH2.\n\n3. Complex IV inhibitors (e.g., cyanide, azide): These inhibitors block the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to oxygen, reducing the ATP yield by preventing the generation of ATP from both NADH and FADH2.\n\n4. ATP synthase inhibitors (e.g., oligomycin): These inhibitors block the ATP synthase enzyme directly, preventing the synthesis of ATP from the proton gradient.\n\nIn summary, the overall ATP yield per glucose molecule metabolized in the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation is 38 ATP in eukaryotes and 36 ATP in prokaryotes. Electron transport chain inhibitors can reduce this energy yield by blocking the flow of electrons and disrupting the proton gradient necessary for ATP synthesis."
