    "message_2": "The addition of a catalyst to the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide in the presence of yeast will significantly increase the reaction rate. In this case, yeast serves as a source of the enzyme catalase, which acts as a catalyst for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into water (H2O) and oxygen gas (O2).\n\nCatalysts work by lowering the activation energy required for a reaction to occur, allowing the reaction to proceed at a faster rate. In the case of hydrogen peroxide decomposition, the catalase enzyme in yeast provides an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy. This results in an increased reaction rate, leading to the faster production of water and oxygen gas.\n\nIt is important to note that the catalyst itself is not consumed in the reaction and can be used repeatedly to catalyze the reaction."
