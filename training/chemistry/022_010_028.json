    "message_2": "To find the mass of barium sulfate (BaSO4) formed, we first need to determine the limiting reactant in the reaction. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nBaCl2 + Na2SO4 → BaSO4 + 2NaCl\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of each reactant:\n\nMoles of BaCl2 = (Volume × Molarity) = (0.5 L × 0.2 mol/L) = 0.1 mol\nMoles of Na2SO4 = (Volume × Molarity) = (0.5 L × 0.1 mol/L) = 0.05 mol\n\nNow, we need to determine the stoichiometry of the reaction. From the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of BaCl2 reacts with 1 mole of Na2SO4. Therefore, the mole ratio of BaCl2 to Na2SO4 is 1:1.\n\nNext, we compare the moles of each reactant to determine the limiting reactant:\n\n0.1 mol BaCl2 / 1 = 0.1\n0.05 mol Na2SO4 / 1 = 0.05\n\nSince 0.05 < 0.1, Na2SO4 is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow, we can find the moles of BaSO4 formed using the stoichiometry of the reaction:\n\nMoles of BaSO4 = Moles of limiting reactant (Na2SO4) = 0.05 mol\n\nFinally, we can calculate the mass of BaSO4 formed using its molar mass (233.43 g/mol):\n\nMass of BaSO4 = (Moles of BaSO4 × Molar mass of BaSO4) = (0.05 mol × 233.43 g/mol) = 11.67 g\n\nSo, 11.67 grams of barium sulfate (BaSO4) will be formed when 500 mL of 0.2 M barium chloride (BaCl2) is mixed with 500 mL of 0.1 M sodium sulfate (Na2SO4)."
