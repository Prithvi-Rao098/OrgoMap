    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (K) of the redox reaction, we can use the expression for the reaction quotient (Q) at equilibrium:\n\nK = [Fe3+][Ce3+] / [Fe2+][Ce4+]\n\nGiven the equilibrium concentrations of each species:\n\n[Fe2+] = 0.10 M\n[Ce4+] = 0.20 M\n[Fe3+] = 0.05 M\n[Ce3+] = 0.15 M\n\nSubstitute these values into the expression for K:\n\nK = (0.05)(0.15) / (0.10)(0.20)\n\nK = 0.0075 / 0.02\n\nK = 0.375\n\nThe equilibrium constant for the redox reaction at room temperature is 0.375."
