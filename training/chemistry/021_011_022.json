    "message_1": "A chemistry student needs to find the bond dissociation energy of a hydrogen molecule. The student knows that the H-H bond energy is 432 kJ/mol and wants to determine how much energy is required to break the bond completely into separate hydrogen atoms. What is the bond dissociation energy of the hydrogen molecule?",
    "message_2": "The bond dissociation energy of a hydrogen molecule (H2) is the energy required to break the H-H bond completely into separate hydrogen atoms. In this case, the student already knows that the H-H bond energy is 432 kJ/mol. Therefore, the bond dissociation energy of the hydrogen molecule is also 432 kJ/mol."
