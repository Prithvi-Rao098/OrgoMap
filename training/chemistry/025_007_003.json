    "message_2": "Chemistry students in limited-resource settings can access essential chemistry textbooks and course materials through various means to attain a high level of understanding and competence in the subject. Some of these methods include:\n\n1. Online resources: Many educational websites and organizations offer free access to chemistry textbooks, lecture notes, and other course materials. Examples include OpenStax, Khan Academy, and MIT OpenCourseWare. Students can access these resources using a computer, tablet, or smartphone with internet access.\n\n2. Public libraries: Local public libraries often have a collection of chemistry textbooks and other educational materials that students can borrow for free. Students can also access online resources through library computers if they do not have personal devices.\n\n3. Collaborative learning: Students can form study groups with their peers to share resources, exchange notes, and discuss concepts. This can help them pool their resources and gain a better understanding of the subject.\n\n4. Reach out to teachers and professors: Students can ask their teachers or professors for recommendations on affordable or free resources. Educators may have access to materials that they can share with students or suggest alternative sources.\n\n5. Educational NGOs and charities: Some non-governmental organizations and charities provide educational resources, including textbooks and course materials, to students in limited-resource settings. Students can research and reach out to these organizations for assistance.\n\n6. Used books and book exchanges: Students can search for used chemistry textbooks at local bookstores, online marketplaces, or through book exchange programs. Used books are often more affordable than new ones and can still provide valuable information.\n\n7. Open Educational Resources (OER): OER are teaching, learning, and research materials that are freely available online for anyone to use. Students can search for chemistry OER through websites like OER Commons and MERLOT.\n\nBy utilizing these methods, chemistry students in limited-resource settings can access essential course materials and develop a strong understanding of the subject."
