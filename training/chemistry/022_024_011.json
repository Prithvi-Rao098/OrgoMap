    "message_1": "What mass of sodium acetate (NaC2H3O2) needs to be added to 500 mL of a 0.1 M acetic acid (HC2H3O2) solution to prepare a buffer solution with a pH of 4.8? The pKa of acetic acid is 4.75.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log ([A-]/[HA])\n\nwhere pH is the desired pH of the buffer solution, pKa is the acid dissociation constant of the weak acid, [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base (sodium acetate), and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid (acetic acid).\n\nWe are given the following information:\n\npH = 4.8\npKa = 4.75\n[HA] = 0.1 M (concentration of acetic acid)\n\nWe need to find the concentration of sodium acetate ([A-]):\n\n4.8 = 4.75 + log ([A-]/0.1)\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for [A-]:\n\n[A-] = 0.1 * 10^(4.8 - 4.75)\n[A-] = 0.1 * 10^0.05\n[A-] ≈ 0.1122 M\n\nNow that we have the concentration of sodium acetate, we can find the mass of sodium acetate needed for the 500 mL solution:\n\nmass = (volume of solution) * (concentration of sodium acetate) * (molar mass of sodium acetate)\n\nThe molar mass of sodium acetate (NaC2H3O2) is approximately 82.03 g/mol.\n\nmass = (0.5 L) * (0.1122 mol/L) * (82.03 g/mol)\nmass ≈ 4.60 g\n\nTherefore, approximately 4.60 grams of sodium acetate need to be added to the 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid solution to prepare a buffer solution with a pH of 4.8."
