    "message_2": "To increase the yield of ibuprofen during the synthesis from 2-methylpropylbenzene and carbon dioxide, several reaction conditions can be adjusted:\n\n1. Temperature: Increasing the reaction temperature can increase the reaction rate, leading to a higher yield. However, it is essential to find the optimal temperature, as too high temperatures may cause side reactions or degradation of the product.\n\n2. Pressure: Increasing the pressure of carbon dioxide can improve its solubility in the reaction mixture and enhance its reactivity with 2-methylpropylbenzene. This can lead to a higher yield of ibuprofen.\n\n3. Catalyst: Using an appropriate catalyst can significantly improve the yield of ibuprofen. Transition metal catalysts, such as palladium or nickel complexes, can be used to facilitate the reaction between 2-methylpropylbenzene and carbon dioxide.\n\n4. Solvent: Choosing the right solvent can have a significant impact on the reaction rate and yield. Polar aprotic solvents, such as dimethylformamide (DMF) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), can improve the solubility of the reactants and enhance the reaction rate.\n\n5. Reaction time: Allowing the reaction to proceed for a longer time can lead to a higher yield of ibuprofen. However, it is essential to find the optimal reaction time, as too long reaction times may cause side reactions or degradation of the product.\n\n6. Reactant concentration: Increasing the concentration of the reactants can improve the reaction rate and yield. However, it is essential to find the optimal concentration, as too high concentrations may cause side reactions or lead to solubility issues.\n\n7. Reaction stoichiometry: Adjusting the stoichiometry of the reactants can help improve the yield of ibuprofen. Providing an excess of one of the reactants, typically carbon dioxide, can drive the reaction to completion and increase the yield.\n\nBy optimizing these reaction conditions, it is possible to improve the yield of ibuprofen during the synthesis from 2-methylpropylbenzene and carbon dioxide."
