    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (K) for the given reaction, we can use the expression:\n\nK = [S4O6^2-][I^-]^2 / ([S2O3^2-]^2[I2])\n\nNow, we can plug in the given concentrations:\n\nK = (0.050)(0.050)^2 / ((0.200)^2(0.100))\nK = (0.050)(0.0025) / (0.040)\nK = 0.000125 / 0.040\nK = 0.003125\n\nThe value of the equilibrium constant for the redox reaction between iodine and thiosulfate ion in a solution at a temperature of 25°C is approximately 0.0031."
