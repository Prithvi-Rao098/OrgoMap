    "message_2": "To have at least one triple bond in a C6H12 molecule, we need to consider alkynes. However, the general formula for alkynes is CnH2n-2. For a C6 alkyne, the formula would be C6H10, not C6H12. Therefore, it is not possible to have a structural isomer of C6H12 with at least one triple bond."
