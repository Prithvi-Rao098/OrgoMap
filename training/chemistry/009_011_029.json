    "message_2": "To find the age of the fossil, we can use the formula:\n\nAge = number of half-lives × half-life of the isotope\n\nGiven that the fossil has undergone 5 half-lives and the half-life of the isotope is 100,000 years, we can calculate the age as follows:\n\nAge = 5 × 100,000 years\nAge = 500,000 years\n\nThe age of the fossil is 500,000 years."
