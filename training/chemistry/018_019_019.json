    "message_2": "The reaction between hydrogen gas (H2) and iodine gas (I2) to form hydrogen iodide gas (2HI) is an exothermic reaction, meaning it releases heat. The balanced equation for this reaction is:\n\nH2(g) + I2(g) â‡Œ 2HI(g) + heat\n\nAccording to Le Chatelier's principle, if a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in temperature, pressure, or concentration of reactants and products, the system will adjust its equilibrium position to counteract the change.\n\nIn this case, when the temperature is increased, the system will try to counteract the change by shifting the equilibrium position to the side that absorbs heat. Since the forward reaction is exothermic (releases heat), the equilibrium will shift to the left (toward the reactants) to absorb the added heat. This means that the concentration of hydrogen gas and iodine gas will increase, while the concentration of hydrogen iodide gas will decrease.\n\nAs a result, the equilibrium constant (K) for the reaction will decrease. The equilibrium constant is defined as the ratio of the concentrations of products to reactants at equilibrium, raised to their respective stoichiometric coefficients. When the equilibrium shifts to the left, the ratio of products to reactants decreases, leading to a decrease in the equilibrium constant."
