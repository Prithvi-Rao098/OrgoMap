    "message_2": "Surface modification of polyethylene can significantly alter its properties, including adhesion, wettability, and chemical resistance. The introduction of polar functional groups onto the surface of polyethylene can improve its adhesion properties when subjected to water.\n\nPolyethylene is a hydrophobic polymer, which means it does not readily interact with polar molecules like water. This results in poor adhesion and wettability when polyethylene comes into contact with water or other polar substances. By introducing polar functional groups onto the surface of polyethylene, the surface becomes more hydrophilic, or water-attracting, which can improve its adhesion properties.\n\nThere are several methods to introduce polar functional groups onto the surface of polyethylene, such as plasma treatment, chemical grafting, and UV/ozone treatment. These methods can create functional groups like hydroxyl (-OH), carboxyl (-COOH), and amine (-NH2) on the surface of polyethylene, which can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules. This increased interaction between the polyethylene surface and water molecules leads to better adhesion and wettability.\n\nIn summary, surface modification of polyethylene by introducing polar functional groups can significantly improve its adhesion properties when subjected to water. This is due to the increased hydrophilicity of the modified surface, which allows for better interaction with water molecules through hydrogen bonding. This improved adhesion can be beneficial in various applications, such as coatings, adhesives, and composite materials."
