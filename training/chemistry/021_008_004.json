    "message_2": "The carbonate ion (CO3^2-) has three resonance structures. In each resonance structure, one of the oxygen atoms forms a double bond with the central carbon atom, while the other two oxygen atoms form single bonds with the central carbon atom. The three resonance structures can be represented as follows:\n\n1. O=C-O(-)-O(-)\n2. O(-)-C=O-O(-)\n3. O(-)-O(-)-C=O\n\nNow, let's determine the formal charge on each atom in each resonance structure:\n\n1. O=C-O(-)-O(-)\n   - Carbon (C): Formal charge = 4 - 3 - 1/2(4) = 0\n   - Double-bonded Oxygen (O): Formal charge = 6 - 4 - 1/2(4) = 0\n   - Single-bonded Oxygen (O-): Formal charge = 6 - 6 - 1/2(2) = -1 (x2)\n\n2. O(-)-C=O-O(-)\n   - Carbon (C): Formal charge = 4 - 3 - 1/2(4) = 0\n   - Double-bonded Oxygen (O): Formal charge = 6 - 4 - 1/2(4) = 0\n   - Single-bonded Oxygen (O-): Formal charge = 6 - 6 - 1/2(2) = -1 (x2)\n\n3. O(-)-O(-)-C=O\n   - Carbon (C): Formal charge = 4 - 3 - 1/2(4) = 0\n   - Double-bonded Oxygen (O): Formal charge = 6 - 4 - 1/2(4) = 0\n   - Single-bonded Oxygen (O-): Formal charge = 6 - 6 - 1/2(2) = -1 (x2)\n\nIn summary, the carbonate ion (CO3^2-) has three resonance structures with the same formal charges on each atom: Carbon has a formal charge of 0, the double-bonded oxygen has a formal charge of 0, and each single-bonded oxygen has a formal charge of -1."
