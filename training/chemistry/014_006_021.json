    "message_2": "The coordination number for the compound [Co(NH3)6]Cl3 is 6. This is because there are six ammonia (NH3) ligands surrounding the central cobalt (Co) atom, forming a complex ion.\n\nThis compound can exhibit geometrical isomerism, specifically, optical isomerism. Optical isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, also known as enantiomers. In the case of [Co(NH3)6]Cl3, the arrangement of the six ammonia ligands around the cobalt atom can form two different enantiomers, which are optically active and can rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions."
