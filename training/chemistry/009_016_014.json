    "message_1": "Consider a radioactive source that emits gamma rays of energy 1.2 MeV. If a gamma spectrometer records 1000 counts per second when a sample is placed in front of it, but records only 500 counts per second when the sample is removed, what is the activity of the sample? Assume that the efficiency of the gamma spectrometer is 50% for gamma rays of energy 1.2 MeV.",
    "message_2": "To find the activity of the sample, we first need to determine the number of counts per second that are due to the sample itself. Since the spectrometer records 1000 counts per second with the sample and 500 counts per second without the sample, the difference (1000 - 500 = 500 counts per second) is due to the sample.\n\nNow, we need to account for the efficiency of the gamma spectrometer. The efficiency is given as 50%, which means that only half of the gamma rays emitted by the sample are actually detected by the spectrometer. To find the true activity of the sample, we need to divide the detected counts per second by the efficiency:\n\nTrue activity = (Detected counts per second) / (Efficiency)\nTrue activity = 500 counts per second / 0.50\nTrue activity = 1000 counts per second\n\nSo, the activity of the sample is 1000 counts per second."
