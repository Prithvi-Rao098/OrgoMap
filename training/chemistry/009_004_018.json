    "message_2": "The minimum temperature required for nuclear fusion to occur between deuterium and tritium is approximately 40 million Kelvin (40 MK or 40 x 10^6 K). This temperature is necessary to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged nuclei and allow them to come close enough for the strong nuclear force to take over and cause fusion.\n\nThe temperature at the center of the sun is estimated to be around 15 million Kelvin (15 MK or 15 x 10^6 K). This is lower than the temperature required for deuterium-tritium fusion. However, the sun primarily undergoes proton-proton fusion, which has a lower temperature threshold than deuterium-tritium fusion."
