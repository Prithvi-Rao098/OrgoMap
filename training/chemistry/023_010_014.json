    "message_1": "What is the yield of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine that can be obtained when 5 grams of hydrazine is reacted with excess 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene and the reaction is carried out according to the given procedure?",
    "message_2": "To determine the yield of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, we need to first find the limiting reagent and then use stoichiometry to calculate the theoretical yield. In this case, hydrazine is the limiting reagent since it is given in a specific amount (5 grams) and 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene is in excess.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nC₆H₃Cl(NO₂)₂ + N₂H₄ → C₆H₃(NO₂)₂NHNH₂ + HCl\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of hydrazine (N₂H₄) in 5 grams:\n\nMolar mass of N₂H₄ = (2 × 14.01) + (4 × 1.01) = 32.05 g/mol\n\nMoles of N₂H₄ = mass / molar mass = 5 g / 32.05 g/mol = 0.156 moles\n\nNow, we can use stoichiometry to find the moles of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (C₆H₃(NO₂)₂NHNH₂) produced:\n\n1 mole of N₂H₄ produces 1 mole of C₆H₃(NO₂)₂NHNH₂\n\n0.156 moles of N₂H₄ will produce 0.156 moles of C₆H₃(NO₂)₂NHNH₂\n\nNext, we need to convert the moles of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine to grams:\n\nMolar mass of C₆H₃(NO₂)₂NHNH₂ = (6 × 12.01) + (3 × 1.01) + (4 × 14.01) + (4 × 16.00) = 198.14 g/mol\n\nMass of C₆H₃(NO₂)₂NHNH₂ = moles × molar mass = 0.156 moles × 198.14 g/mol = 30.91 grams\n\nSo, the theoretical yield of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine is 30.91 grams. However, the actual yield will depend on the efficiency of the given procedure and any side reactions or losses during the process. To find the actual yield, you would need to know the percentage yield of the procedure."
