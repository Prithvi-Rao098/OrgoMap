    "message_2": "When copper is added to a silver nitrate solution, a single replacement reaction occurs. Copper is more reactive than silver, so it displaces silver from the silver nitrate solution. The equation for the reaction is:\n\nCu(s) + 2AgNO₃(aq) → Cu(NO₃)₂(aq) + 2Ag(s)\n\nIn this reaction, solid copper (Cu) reacts with aqueous silver nitrate (AgNO₃) to form aqueous copper(II) nitrate (Cu(NO₃)₂) and solid silver (Ag). \n\nObservations:\n1. The color of the solution changes from colorless to blue, indicating the formation of copper(II) nitrate.\n2. Silver metal precipitates out of the solution and may appear as a grayish-white solid or deposit on the surface of the copper.\n3. The copper metal may gradually dissolve or become smaller in size as it is replaced by the silver precipitate."
