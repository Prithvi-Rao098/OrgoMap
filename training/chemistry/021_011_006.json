    "message_2": "To find the bond dissociation energy of the O-H bond in a water molecule, we first need to understand the reaction given:\n\n2 H2O → 2 H2 + O2; ΔH = -572 kJ/mol\n\nThis reaction involves breaking 4 O-H bonds in 2 water molecules and forming 2 O=O bonds in an oxygen molecule and 4 H-H bonds in 2 hydrogen molecules.\n\nNow, let's denote the bond dissociation energy of O-H as E(O-H), the bond dissociation energy of O=O as E(O=O), and the bond dissociation energy of H-H as E(H-H).\n\nAccording to Hess's law, the enthalpy change of the reaction (ΔH) is equal to the sum of the bond dissociation energies of the bonds broken minus the sum of the bond dissociation energies of the bonds formed:\n\nΔH = [4 * E(O-H)] - [2 * E(O=O) + 4 * E(H-H)]\n\nWe are given ΔH = -572 kJ/mol. To find E(O-H), we need the bond dissociation energies of O=O and H-H. The bond dissociation energy of O=O is approximately 498 kJ/mol, and the bond dissociation energy of H-H is approximately 436 kJ/mol.\n\nNow we can plug these values into the equation:\n\n-572 kJ/mol = [4 * E(O-H)] - [2 * 498 kJ/mol + 4 * 436 kJ/mol]\n\nSolving for E(O-H):\n\n-572 kJ/mol + 996 kJ/mol + 1744 kJ/mol = 4 * E(O-H)\n\n1168 kJ/mol = 4 * E(O-H)\n\nE(O-H) = 292 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the bond dissociation energy of the O-H bond in a water molecule is approximately 292 kJ/mol."
