    "message_2": "The presence of a catalyst does not affect the equilibrium position of a reversible reaction. Catalysts work by lowering the activation energy of a reaction, which allows the reaction to proceed at a faster rate. However, catalysts do not change the equilibrium constant or the position of the equilibrium, as they affect both the forward and reverse reactions equally.\n\nLe Chatelier's principle states that if a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in concentration, temperature, or pressure, the system will adjust its equilibrium position to counteract the change. Since a catalyst does not change the concentrations, temperature, or pressure of the reactants and products, it does not affect the equilibrium position according to Le Chatelier's principle.\n\nFor example, consider the reversible reaction between hydrogen and iodine to form hydrogen iodide:\n\nH2(g) + I2(g) â‡Œ 2HI(g)\n\nIn this reaction, the equilibrium position is determined by the concentrations of hydrogen, iodine, and hydrogen iodide. If a catalyst is added to the reaction, it will increase the rate at which hydrogen and iodine react to form hydrogen iodide, as well as the rate at which hydrogen iodide decomposes back into hydrogen and iodine. Since the catalyst affects both the forward and reverse reactions equally, the equilibrium position remains unchanged."
