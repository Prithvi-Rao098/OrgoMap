    "message_1": "What is the concentration of copper (II) ions in a solution when a current of 0.5 A is passed through a copper (II) sulfate solution for 2 hours using a copper electrode? The mass of copper electrode is 12.5 g and the volume of the solution is 500 ml. The standard reduction potential of Cu2+ | Cu is 0.34 V.",
    "message_2": "To determine the concentration of copper (II) ions in the solution, we first need to find the amount of copper that has been deposited on the electrode during the electrolysis process.\n\n1. Calculate the total charge passed through the solution:\nCurrent (I) = 0.5 A\nTime (t) = 2 hours = 7200 seconds (since 1 hour = 3600 seconds)\n\nTotal charge (Q) = Current × Time\nQ = 0.5 A × 7200 s = 3600 Coulombs\n\n2. Determine the number of moles of electrons transferred:\nThe Faraday constant (F) is the charge of one mole of electrons, which is approximately 96485 Coulombs/mol.\n\nMoles of electrons (n) = Total charge / Faraday constant\nn = 3600 C / 96485 C/mol = 0.0373 mol\n\n3. Calculate the number of moles of copper deposited:\nThe balanced half-reaction for the reduction of copper (II) ions is:\n\nCu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu\n\nFrom the stoichiometry of the reaction, 2 moles of electrons are required to deposit 1 mole of copper. Therefore,\n\nMoles of copper deposited = Moles of electrons / 2\nMoles of copper deposited = 0.0373 mol / 2 = 0.01865 mol\n\n4. Determine the concentration of copper (II) ions in the solution:\nThe volume of the solution is 500 mL, which is equal to 0.5 L. To find the concentration, we divide the moles of copper by the volume of the solution in liters.\n\nConcentration of Cu²⁺ ions = Moles of copper / Volume of solution\nConcentration of Cu²⁺ ions = 0.01865 mol / 0.5 L = 0.0373 mol/L\n\nSo, the concentration of copper (II) ions in the solution is 0.0373 mol/L."
