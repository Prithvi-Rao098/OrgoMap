    "message_2": "To find the density of a substance, we can use the formula:\n\nDensity = Mass / Volume\n\nGiven the mass of the sodium chloride crystal is 10 grams and its volume is 5 mL, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nDensity = 10 grams / 5 mL = 2 grams/mL\n\nThe density of the sodium chloride crystal is 2 grams/mL."
