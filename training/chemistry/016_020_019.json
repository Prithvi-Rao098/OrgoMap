Calculate the enthalpy of desorption per mole of methanol adsorbed on the surface of activated charcoal.\"",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of desorption per mole of methanol adsorbed on the surface of activated charcoal, we first need to determine the number of moles of methanol in the 2 grams sample.\n\nThe molecular weight of methanol (CH3OH) is:\n12.01 g/mol (C) + 4.03 g/mol (H) + 16.00 g/mol (O) = 32.04 g/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of moles of methanol in the 2 grams sample:\nmoles of methanol = mass of methanol / molecular weight of methanol\nmoles of methanol = 2 g / 32.04 g/mol = 0.0624 mol\n\nThe heat of desorption is given as 20 kJ/mol. Since we have calculated the moles of methanol, we can now determine the enthalpy of desorption per mole of methanol adsorbed on the surface of activated charcoal.\n\nEnthalpy of desorption = heat of desorption / moles of methanol\nEnthalpy of desorption = 20 kJ/mol / 0.0624 mol = 320.51 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy of desorption per mole of methanol adsorbed on the surface of activated charcoal is 320.51 kJ/mol."
