    "message_2": "The isotopic notation for carbon-14 is written as ¹⁴C or C-14, where 14 is the mass number (sum of protons and neutrons) and C is the chemical symbol for carbon.\n\nCarbon-14 has:\n- 6 protons (since the atomic number of carbon is 6)\n- 8 neutrons (14 - 6 = 8)\n- 6 electrons (equal to the number of protons in a neutral atom)\n\nSo, in the nucleus of carbon-14, there are 6 protons and 8 neutrons, and in the atomic structure, there are 6 electrons."
