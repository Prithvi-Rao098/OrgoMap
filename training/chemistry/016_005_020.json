    "message_1": "What is the enthalpy of combustion of methane (CH4) if 1.00 mole of methane is completely combusted in a bomb calorimeter with a heat capacity of 1.25 kJ/°C, and the temperature increases by 5.00°C? Given that the balanced chemical equation for the complete combustion of methane is: CH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(l) and the standard enthalpy of formation of CH4(g) is -74.81 kJ/mol.",
    "message_2": "To find the enthalpy of combustion of methane, we first need to determine the heat released during the combustion process. We can do this using the heat capacity of the bomb calorimeter and the temperature increase.\n\nq = heat capacity × temperature increase\nq = 1.25 kJ/°C × 5.00 °C\nq = 6.25 kJ\n\nSince 1.00 mole of methane is combusted, we can find the enthalpy of combustion per mole (ΔH_combustion) by dividing the heat released (q) by the number of moles of methane.\n\nΔH_combustion = q / moles of CH4\nΔH_combustion = 6.25 kJ / 1.00 mol\nΔH_combustion = -6.25 kJ/mol\n\nHowever, this value is not accurate because the standard enthalpy of formation of CH4(g) is given as -74.81 kJ/mol. To find the correct enthalpy of combustion, we need to use the standard enthalpies of formation for all the reactants and products in the balanced chemical equation.\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation for O2(g) is 0 kJ/mol, for CO2(g) is -393.5 kJ/mol, and for H2O(l) is -285.8 kJ/mol.\n\nUsing Hess's Law, we can calculate the enthalpy of combustion as follows:\n\nΔH_combustion = [1 × ΔH_f(CO2) + 2 × ΔH_f(H2O)] - [1 × ΔH_f(CH4) + 2 × ΔH_f(O2)]\n\nΔH_combustion = [1 × (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 × (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [1 × (-74.81 kJ/mol) + 2 × (0 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH_combustion = (-393.5 - 571.6 + 74.81) kJ/mol\n\nΔH_combustion = -890.29 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy of combustion of methane (CH4) is -890.29 kJ/mol."
