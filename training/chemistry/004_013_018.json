    "message_2": "To determine the amount of copper present in a 2-g copper wire using coulometry, we need to know the current and time required to completely dissolve the copper wire. However, since this information is not provided, we can still calculate the number of moles of copper in the wire and then relate it to the amount of charge required to dissolve it.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of copper in the 2-g wire. The molar mass of copper (Cu) is 63.55 g/mol.\n\nNumber of moles = mass / molar mass\nNumber of moles = 2 g / 63.55 g/mol = 0.0315 mol\n\nNow, we need to find the amount of charge required to dissolve the copper wire. Copper has a valence of +2, meaning it requires 2 moles of electrons (2 Faradays) to dissolve 1 mole of copper.\n\nAmount of charge = number of moles × Faraday constant × valence\nAmount of charge = 0.0315 mol × 96,485 C/mol × 2\nAmount of charge = 6,078.57 C\n\nSo, 6,078.57 Coulombs of charge are required to dissolve the 2-g copper wire. However, without information on the current and time used in the coulometry experiment, we cannot provide a more specific answer to the problem."
