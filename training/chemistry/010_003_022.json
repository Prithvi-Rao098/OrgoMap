    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the given electrochemical reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG = ΔG(products) - ΔG(reactants)\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\n2Fe³⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → 2Fe²⁺(aq)\n\nThe reactants are 2 moles of Fe³⁺(aq) and the products are 2 moles of Fe²⁺(aq). We are given the standard Gibbs energy of formation for both Fe³⁺(aq) and Fe²⁺(aq). \n\nFirst, we need to multiply the standard Gibbs energy of formation of each species by their stoichiometric coefficients:\n\nΔG(reactants) = 2 * (-290.5 kJ/mol) = -581.0 kJ/mol\nΔG(products) = 2 * (-91.2 kJ/mol) = -182.4 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can use the equation to find the Gibbs free energy change for the reaction:\n\nΔG = ΔG(products) - ΔG(reactants)\nΔG = (-182.4 kJ/mol) - (-581.0 kJ/mol)\nΔG = 398.6 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the Gibbs free energy change for the given electrochemical reaction at 298 K is 398.6 kJ/mol."
