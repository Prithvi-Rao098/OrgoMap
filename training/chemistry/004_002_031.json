    "message_2": "As a chemist, I can help you understand the process of determining the percentage composition of a mixture using gas chromatography analysis. However, I cannot provide the exact percentages without the actual data from the chromatogram.\n\nGas chromatography (GC) is an analytical technique used to separate and analyze volatile compounds in a mixture. Here's a general outline of the process to determine the percentage composition of benzene, toluene, and xylene in a mixture:\n\n1. Prepare the sample: The mixture containing benzene, toluene, and xylene should be dissolved in a suitable solvent and injected into the gas chromatograph.\n\n2. Separation: The sample will be vaporized and carried through a column by an inert gas (usually helium or nitrogen). The compounds will separate based on their volatility and interaction with the column's stationary phase.\n\n3. Detection: As the separated compounds exit the column, they will be detected by a suitable detector, such as a flame ionization detector (FID) or a mass spectrometer (MS). The detector will generate a signal proportional to the concentration of each compound.\n\n4. Data analysis: The resulting chromatogram will show peaks corresponding to each compound. The area under each peak is proportional to the concentration of the compound in the mixture. By comparing the peak areas to those of known standards, you can determine the concentration of each compound in the sample.\n\n5. Calculate the percentage composition: Once you have the concentration of each compound, you can calculate the percentage composition by dividing the concentration of each compound by the total concentration of all compounds and multiplying by 100.\n\nFor example, if the concentrations of benzene, toluene, and xylene are 25, 50, and 25 mg/mL, respectively, the total concentration is 100 mg/mL. The percentage composition would be:\n\nBenzene: (25/100) x 100 = 25%\nToluene: (50/100) x 100 = 50%\nXylene: (25/100) x 100 = 25%\n\nTo provide the exact percentage composition of your specific mixture, you would need to perform the gas chromatography analysis and provide the data from the chromatogram."
