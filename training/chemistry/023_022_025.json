    "message_2": "To calculate the theoretical yield of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid, we need to use stoichiometry. First, we need the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nC7H6O2 (benzoic acid) + 2 HNO3 (nitric acid) → C7H4N2O6 (2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid) + 2 H2O (water)\n\nNext, we need the molar masses of benzoic acid and 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid:\n\nBenzoic acid (C7H6O2): (7 × 12.01) + (6 × 1.01) + (2 × 16.00) = 122.12 g/mol\n2,4-Dinitrobenzoic acid (C7H4N2O6): (7 × 12.01) + (4 × 1.01) + (2 × 14.01) + (6 × 16.00) = 212.14 g/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the moles of benzoic acid in 10 grams:\n\nmoles of benzoic acid = mass / molar mass = 10 g / 122.12 g/mol = 0.0819 mol\n\nSince the balanced equation shows a 1:1 ratio between benzoic acid and 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid, the moles of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid produced will be the same as the moles of benzoic acid:\n\nmoles of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid = 0.0819 mol\n\nFinally, we can calculate the theoretical yield of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid:\n\ntheoretical yield = moles × molar mass = 0.0819 mol × 212.14 g/mol = 17.37 g\n\nSo, the theoretical yield of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid that can be obtained from 10 grams of benzoic acid and excess nitric acid, assuming 100% conversion efficiency, is 17.37 grams."
