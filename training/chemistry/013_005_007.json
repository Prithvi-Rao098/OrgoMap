The cross-sectional area of the nitrogen molecule is 0.162 nm² and the density of nitrogen at liquid nitrogen temperature is 0.808 g/mL. The mass of the activated carbon sample is 0.50 g.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the specific surface area of the activated carbon sample, we will use the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) theory, which relates the volume of adsorbed gas to the surface area of the adsorbent. The equation for the BET surface area is:\n\nBET surface area = (V_ads * N_A * σ) / (m * ρ)\n\nwhere:\n- V_ads is the volume of adsorbed gas (20 mL)\n- N_A is Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23 molecules/mol)\n- σ is the cross-sectional area of the nitrogen molecule (0.162 nm²)\n- m is the mass of the activated carbon sample (0.50 g)\n- ρ is the density of nitrogen at liquid nitrogen temperature (0.808 g/mL)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the volume of adsorbed nitrogen gas to moles. We can do this using the density of nitrogen:\n\nmass of nitrogen = V_ads * ρ = 20 mL * 0.808 g/mL = 16.16 g\n\nNow, we can use the molar mass of nitrogen (28.02 g/mol) to convert the mass of nitrogen to moles:\n\nmoles of nitrogen = mass of nitrogen / molar mass of nitrogen = 16.16 g / 28.02 g/mol = 0.577 mol\n\nNow we can calculate the BET surface area:\n\nBET surface area = (0.577 mol * 6.022 x 10^23 molecules/mol * 0.162 nm²) / (0.50 g * 16.16 g)\n\nBET surface area = (5.65 x 10^22 nm²) / 8.08 g\n\nBET surface area = 6.99 x 10^21 nm²/g\n\nTo convert the surface area to m²/g, we can use the conversion factor 1 nm² = 10^-18 m²:\n\nBET surface area = 6.99 x 10^21 nm²/g * 10^-18 m²/nm² = 699 m²/g\n\nSo, the specific surface area of the activated carbon sample is approximately 699 m²/g."
