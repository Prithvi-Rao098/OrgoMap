    "message_2": "To determine the age of the fossil sample, we need to find out how many half-lives have passed since the sample contained 100 milligrams of the radioactive isotope.\n\nGiven that the remaining amount of the isotope is 12.5 milligrams, we can use the formula:\n\nFinal amount = Initial amount * (1/2)^n\n\nWhere n is the number of half-lives.\n\nIn this case, the final amount is 12.5 milligrams, and the initial amount is 100 milligrams. We can set up the equation as follows:\n\n12.5 = 100 * (1/2)^n\n\nNow, we need to solve for n:\n\n12.5 / 100 = (1/2)^n\n0.125 = (1/2)^n\n\nTaking the logarithm of both sides:\n\nlog(0.125) = n * log(1/2)\nn = log(0.125) / log(1/2)\nn ≈ 3\n\nSo, approximately 3 half-lives have passed since the sample contained 100 milligrams of the radioactive isotope.\n\nNow, we know that 5 half-lives equal a certain amount of time (let's call it T). Since 3 half-lives have passed, we can find the age of the fossil sample by calculating the proportion of time that has passed:\n\nAge of the fossil sample = (3 half-lives / 5 half-lives) * T\n\nWe don't have the exact value of T, but we can express the age of the fossil sample as a proportion of T:\n\nAge of the fossil sample ≈ 0.6 * T\n\nSo, the age of the fossil sample is approximately 60% of the time it takes for 5 half-lives to pass."
