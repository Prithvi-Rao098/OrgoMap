    "message_2": "The synthesis of phenylalanine from benzyl chloride and ammonia using copper sulfate as a catalyst is not a common or straightforward method. Phenylalanine is typically synthesized through other methods, such as the Strecker synthesis or enzymatic processes. However, I can provide you with general guidelines for optimizing reaction conditions.\n\n1. Temperature: The reaction temperature should be maintained within a moderate range, typically between 50-100Â°C. Higher temperatures may increase the reaction rate, but they can also lead to side reactions and decomposition of the reactants or products.\n\n2. Pressure: The reaction pressure should be kept close to atmospheric pressure (1 atm) to avoid complications from high-pressure systems. However, if the reaction is too slow at atmospheric pressure, you can try increasing the pressure slightly to improve the reaction rate.\n\n3. Time: The reaction time will depend on the specific reaction conditions and the desired yield. It is essential to monitor the reaction progress using analytical techniques such as thin-layer chromatography (TLC) or high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to determine the optimal reaction time. For a 90% yield, you may need to allow the reaction to proceed for several hours or even days, depending on the reaction rate.\n\n4. Catalyst: The amount of copper sulfate catalyst should be kept low, typically around 1-5 mol% relative to the limiting reagent. This will minimize the potential for side reactions and catalyst deactivation while still promoting the desired reaction.\n\nPlease note that these are general guidelines, and the specific conditions for synthesizing phenylalanine from benzyl chloride and ammonia using copper sulfate as a catalyst may vary. It is crucial to perform optimization studies to determine the ideal conditions for your specific system."
