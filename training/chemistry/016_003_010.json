    "message_2": "To calculate the bond dissociation energy of the C-H bond in methane, we need to consider the balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane:\n\nCH₄(g) + 2O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nNow, let's analyze the bonds broken and formed during this reaction:\n\nBonds broken:\n1 C-H bond in CH₄ (which we want to find)\n2 O=O bonds in O₂\n\nBonds formed:\n2 C=O bonds in CO₂\n4 O-H bonds in 2H₂O\n\nUsing Hess's Law, we can write the enthalpy change for the combustion of methane as:\n\nΔH_combustion = Σ E_bonds_broken - Σ E_bonds_formed\n\nGiven:\nΔH_combustion = -890.3 kJ/mol\nE(H-H) = 433.4 kJ/mol\nE(C=O) = 799.5 kJ/mol\nE(O-H) = 463.0 kJ/mol\n\nLet E(C-H) be the bond dissociation energy of the C-H bond in methane. Then:\n\n-890.3 kJ/mol = [E(C-H) + 2 * 433.4 kJ/mol] - [2 * 799.5 kJ/mol + 4 * 463.0 kJ/mol]\n\nNow, we can solve for E(C-H):\n\nE(C-H) = -890.3 kJ/mol + 2 * 799.5 kJ/mol + 4 * 463.0 kJ/mol - 2 * 433.4 kJ/mol\nE(C-H) = -890.3 + 1599 + 1852 - 866.8\nE(C-H) = 1694.7 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the bond dissociation energy of the C-H bond in methane is approximately 1694.7 kJ/mol."
