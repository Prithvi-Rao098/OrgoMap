    "message_2": "The electronegativity difference between a potassium atom and a chlorine atom can be calculated by subtracting the electronegativity value of potassium from that of chlorine:\n\nElectronegativity difference = Electronegativity of chlorine - Electronegativity of potassium\nElectronegativity difference = 3.16 - 0.82\nElectronegativity difference = 2.34\n\nSo, the electronegativity difference between a potassium atom and a chlorine atom is 2.34."
