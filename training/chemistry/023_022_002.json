    "message_2": "To prepare 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid from benzoic acid and nitric acid, you can follow the nitration process. Here is the step-by-step procedure:\n\n1. Preparation of the nitrating agent:\nFirst, you need to prepare the nitrating agent, which is a mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO₃) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). Mix the two acids in a 1:1 ratio. The sulfuric acid acts as a dehydrating agent and helps in the formation of the nitronium ion (NO₂⁺), which is the active nitrating species.\n\n2. Nitration of benzoic acid:\nAdd the benzoic acid (C₆H₅COOH) to the nitrating agent mixture slowly and with constant stirring. The reaction mixture should be cooled in an ice bath to control the temperature, as the nitration reaction is exothermic. The nitronium ion (NO₂⁺) reacts with the benzoic acid to form 2-nitrobenzoic acid (o-nitrobenzoic acid) and 4-nitrobenzoic acid (p-nitrobenzoic acid) as intermediates.\n\nReaction 1: C₆H₅COOH + NO₂⁺ → C₆H₄(NO₂)COOH (2-nitrobenzoic acid or 4-nitrobenzoic acid)\n\n3. Further nitration to form 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid:\nThe 2-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-nitrobenzoic acid intermediates undergo further nitration to form 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid. The reaction is as follows:\n\nReaction 2: C₆H₄(NO₂)COOH + NO₂⁺ → C₆H₃(NO₂)₂COOH (2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid)\n\n4. Isolation and purification of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid:\nAfter the nitration is complete, the reaction mixture is poured onto crushed ice to precipitate the crude product. The crude 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid can be collected by filtration and washed with cold water to remove any unreacted benzoic acid and other impurities. The crude product can be further purified by recrystallization from a suitable solvent, such as ethanol or hot water.\n\n5. Drying and characterization:\nDry the purified 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid and characterize it using various analytical techniques, such as melting point determination, infrared spectroscopy (IR), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, to confirm its identity and purity.\n\nIn summary, the chemical synthesis of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid from benzoic acid and nitric acid involves the preparation of a nitrating agent, nitration of benzoic acid to form intermediates (2-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-nitrobenzoic acid), further nitration to form 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid, and isolation and purification of the final product."
