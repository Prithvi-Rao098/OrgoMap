    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat energy required to vaporize 50 grams of water, we need to first determine the number of moles of water and then use the enthalpy of vaporization to find the energy.\n\n1. Calculate the number of moles of water:\nThe molecular weight of water (H2O) is 18.015 g/mol (1.008 g/mol for hydrogen and 15.999 g/mol for oxygen). \n\nmoles of water = mass of water / molecular weight of water\nmoles of water = 50 g / 18.015 g/mol\nmoles of water ≈ 2.776 moles\n\n2. Calculate the heat energy required using the enthalpy of vaporization:\nThe enthalpy of vaporization of water is given as 40.7 kJ/mol.\n\nHeat energy required = moles of water × enthalpy of vaporization\nHeat energy required = 2.776 moles × 40.7 kJ/mol\nHeat energy required ≈ 112.97 kJ\n\nTherefore, the amount of heat energy required to vaporize 50 grams of water at its boiling point of 100°C is approximately 112.97 kJ."
