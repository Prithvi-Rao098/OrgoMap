    "message_2": "The atomic number (Z) of an element represents the number of protons in its nucleus. In this case, the atomic number is 46, which means there are 46 protons in the nucleus. The element with atomic number 46 is palladium (Pd).\n\nFor a stable nucleus, the number of neutrons (N) is typically close to the number of protons. However, the exact number of neutrons can vary for different isotopes of the same element. To determine the most stable isotope, we can look at the most abundant isotope in nature.\n\nThe most abundant isotope of palladium is Pd-106, which has a natural abundance of approximately 27.33%. The mass number (A) of Pd-106 is 106, which is the sum of protons and neutrons in the nucleus (A = Z + N).\n\nTo find the number of neutrons in Pd-106, we can use the formula:\n\nN = A - Z\nN = 106 - 46\nN = 60\n\nSo, Pd-106 has 60 neutrons in its nucleus. The ratio of the number of neutrons to protons in this stable nucleus is:\n\nNeutrons : Protons = 60 : 46\n\nThis ratio can be simplified by dividing both numbers by their greatest common divisor (2):\n\nNeutrons : Protons = 30 : 23"
