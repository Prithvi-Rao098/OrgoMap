    "message_2": "When 1-bromobutane reacts with sodium hydroxide in ethanol solvent, a nucleophilic substitution reaction occurs, specifically an SN2 reaction. In this reaction, the hydroxide ion (OH-) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon atom bonded to the bromine atom in 1-bromobutane. The bromide ion (Br-) leaves as a leaving group, resulting in the formation of 1-butanol as the product.\n\nReaction:\nCH3CH2CH2CH2Br + NaOH â†’ CH3CH2CH2CH2OH + NaBr\n\nProduct: 1-butanol\nType of nucleophilic substitution reaction: SN2"
