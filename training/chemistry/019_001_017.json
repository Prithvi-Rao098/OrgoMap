    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of methane, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the combustion reaction:\n\nCH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(l)\n\nNext, we will use Hess's Law, which states that the enthalpy change for a reaction is the sum of the enthalpy changes for the formation of the products minus the sum of the enthalpy changes for the formation of the reactants.\n\nΔH_combustion = [ΔH_f(CO2) + 2ΔH_f(H2O)] - [ΔH_f(CH4) + 2ΔH_f(O2)]\n\nSince O2 is in its standard state, its enthalpy of formation is 0 kJ/mol. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\nΔH_combustion = [ΔH_f(CO2) + 2ΔH_f(H2O)] - [ΔH_f(CH4)]\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values for the standard enthalpies of formation:\n\nΔH_combustion = [(-393.51 kJ/mol) + 2(-571.66 kJ/mol)] - [(-74.87 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH_combustion = [-393.51 + 2(-571.66) + 74.87] kJ/mol\n\nΔH_combustion = [-393.51 - 1143.32 + 74.87] kJ/mol\n\nΔH_combustion = [-1461.96] kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of methane at constant pressure is -1461.96 kJ/mol."
