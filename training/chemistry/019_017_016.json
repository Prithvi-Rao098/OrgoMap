    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy change for the sublimation of iodine solid at 25°C, we need to calculate the enthalpy change for the direct conversion of solid iodine to gaseous iodine. This can be done using the given standard enthalpies of fusion and vaporization.\n\nThe sublimation process can be thought of as a two-step process: first, the solid iodine melts to form liquid iodine, and then the liquid iodine vaporizes to form gaseous iodine. The enthalpy change for the sublimation process is the sum of the enthalpy changes for these two steps.\n\nΔHsublimation = ΔHfusion + ΔHvaporization\n\nGiven the standard enthalpies of fusion and vaporization for iodine:\n\nΔHfusion = 7.15 kJ/mol\nΔHvaporization = 41.57 kJ/mol\n\nWe can now calculate the standard enthalpy change for the sublimation of iodine solid:\n\nΔHsublimation = 7.15 kJ/mol + 41.57 kJ/mol = 48.72 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the sublimation of iodine solid at 25°C is 48.72 kJ/mol."
