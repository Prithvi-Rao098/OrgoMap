    "message_2": "The acidic cleavage of an ether bond under Friedel-Crafts conditions involves the following steps:\n\n1. Protonation of the ether: The reaction begins with the protonation of the ether oxygen by a strong acid, such as HCl, HBr, or HI. This step generates an oxonium ion (a positively charged oxygen atom), which makes the ether more susceptible to nucleophilic attack.\n\nR-O-R' + HX → R-O(H)-R' + X⁻\n\n2. Nucleophilic attack: The halide ion (X⁻) from the acid acts as a nucleophile and attacks the more substituted carbon atom of the ether, breaking the C-O bond. This step generates a new C-X bond and an alcohol as the leaving group.\n\nR-O(H)-R' + X⁻ → R-X + R'-OH\n\n3. Deprotonation of the alcohol (optional): If the reaction is carried out under strongly acidic conditions, the alcohol formed in the previous step may undergo deprotonation to form a neutral product.\n\nR'-OH + HX → R'-O⁻ + H₂O + X⁻\n\nIn summary, the acidic cleavage of an ether bond under Friedel-Crafts conditions involves protonation of the ether, nucleophilic attack by a halide ion, and optional deprotonation of the alcohol. The final products are a halide and an alcohol (or its conjugate base)."
