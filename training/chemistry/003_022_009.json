    "message_2": "The solubility of a substance is the maximum amount of solute that can dissolve in a given amount of solvent at a specific temperature. The solubility of sodium chloride (NaCl) in water varies with temperature. \n\nAt 25째C, the solubility of NaCl in water is approximately 36 grams per 100 grams of water. This means that at 25째C, you can dissolve up to 36 grams of NaCl in 100 grams of water before the solution becomes saturated.\n\nIt is important to note that the solubility of a substance can be affected by various factors, such as pressure and the presence of other substances. However, based on the theoretical solubility and the effect of temperature on solubility, the expected solubility of NaCl in water at 25째C is approximately 36 grams per 100 grams of water."
