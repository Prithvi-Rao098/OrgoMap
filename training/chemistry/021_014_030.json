    "message_2": "Phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5) is a molecule with phosphorus (P) as the central atom and five chlorine (Cl) atoms surrounding it. To determine the VSEPR geometry, we first need to identify the number of electron groups around the central atom.\n\nIn PCl5, the central phosphorus atom has 5 valence electrons. Each chlorine atom contributes one electron, making a total of 5 additional electrons from the chlorine atoms. Therefore, there are 5 electron groups around the central phosphorus atom, and all of them are bonding pairs (no lone pairs).\n\nAccording to the VSEPR theory, the electron groups will arrange themselves to minimize repulsion. For 5 electron groups, the geometry is trigonal bipyramidal. In this arrangement, three chlorine atoms form an equatorial triangle around the phosphorus atom, and the other two chlorine atoms are positioned axially, above and below the central atom.\n\nThe bond angles in a trigonal bipyramidal geometry are:\n\n1. Axial-equatorial (Cl-P-Cl): 90 degrees\n2. Equatorial-equatorial (Cl-P-Cl): 120 degrees\n\nSo, the VSEPR geometry of PCl5 is trigonal bipyramidal with bond angles of 90 degrees (axial-equatorial) and 120 degrees (equatorial-equatorial)."
