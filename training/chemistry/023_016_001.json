    "message_2": "To prepare 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline, we need to perform two reactions: chlorination of aniline and nitration of the chlorinated product.\n\n1. Chlorination of aniline:\nAniline (C6H5NH2) reacts with chlorine gas (Cl2) to form 2-chloroaniline (C6H4ClNH2).\n\nC6H5NH2 + Cl2 → C6H4ClNH2 + HCl\n\n2. Nitration of 2-chloroaniline:\n2-chloroaniline reacts with a nitrating mixture (concentrated HNO3 and H2SO4) to form 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline (C6H4ClN2O2).\n\nC6H4ClNH2 + HNO3 → C6H4ClN2O2 + H2O\n\nNow, let's determine the optimum molar ratio of aniline and chlorine gas for maximum yield.\n\nFor the chlorination reaction, the stoichiometry is 1:1, meaning one mole of aniline reacts with one mole of chlorine gas to produce one mole of 2-chloroaniline. Therefore, the optimum molar ratio of aniline to chlorine gas for this reaction is 1:1.\n\nFor the nitration reaction, the stoichiometry is also 1:1, meaning one mole of 2-chloroaniline reacts with one mole of nitric acid (from the nitrating mixture) to produce one mole of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline. However, since we are not given the molar ratio of the nitrating mixture, we cannot determine the exact molar ratio for this reaction.\n\nIn summary, for the chlorination reaction, the optimum molar ratio of aniline to chlorine gas is 1:1. For the nitration reaction, the stoichiometry is 1:1 between 2-chloroaniline and nitric acid, but the exact molar ratio depends on the nitrating mixture used."
