    "message_1": "What is the concentration of a solution containing CuSO4 if its absorbance is 0.472 at a wavelength of 620 nm? The molar absorptivity of CuSO4 at this wavelength is 2.34 x 10^4. The solution has a path length of 1 cm.",
    "message_2": "To find the concentration of the CuSO4 solution, we can use the Beer-Lambert Law, which states:\n\nA = ε * c * l\n\nwhere A is the absorbance, ε is the molar absorptivity, c is the concentration, and l is the path length.\n\nWe are given the absorbance (A = 0.472), the molar absorptivity (ε = 2.34 x 10^4), and the path length (l = 1 cm). We need to solve for the concentration (c).\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for c, we get:\n\nc = A / (ε * l)\n\nNow, plug in the given values:\n\nc = 0.472 / (2.34 x 10^4 * 1)\n\nc = 0.472 / 2.34 x 10^4\n\nc ≈ 2.017 x 10^-5 M\n\nThe concentration of the CuSO4 solution is approximately 2.017 x 10^-5 M."
