    "message_2": "To find the standard electrode potential for the given reaction, we can use the Nernst equation. First, let's write the half-cell reactions:\n\nOxidation half-cell (anode): Zn(s) → Zn2+ (aq) + 2e- (E° = -0.76 V)\nReduction half-cell (cathode): Cu2+ (aq) + 2e- → Cu(s) (E° = +0.34 V)\n\nThe overall cell reaction is:\nZn(s) + Cu2+ (aq) → Zn2+ (aq) + Cu(s)\n\nNow, we can use the Nernst equation to find the cell potential (E_cell) at non-standard conditions:\n\nE_cell = E°_cell - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\n\nwhere E°_cell is the standard cell potential, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin (assume 298 K if not given), n is the number of moles of electrons transferred (2 in this case), F is the Faraday constant (96485 C/mol), and Q is the reaction quotient.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard cell potential (E°_cell) by subtracting the anode potential from the cathode potential:\n\nE°_cell = E°_cathode - E°_anode = 0.34 V - (-0.76 V) = 1.10 V\n\nNext, we can calculate the reaction quotient (Q) using the given concentrations:\n\nQ = [Zn2+]/[Cu2+] = (0.001 M)/(0.1 M) = 0.01\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Nernst equation:\n\nE_cell = 1.10 V - ((8.314 J/mol·K) * (298 K) / (2 * 96485 C/mol)) * ln(0.01)\nE_cell = 1.10 V - (0.0257 V) * ln(0.01)\nE_cell ≈ 1.10 V + 0.118 V\nE_cell ≈ 1.218 V\n\nSo, the standard electrode potential for the given reaction is approximately 1.218 V."
