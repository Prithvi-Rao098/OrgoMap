    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of methane gas, we need to use the standard enthalpies of formation for each compound involved in the reaction. The standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a substance is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states.\n\nThe standard enthalpies of formation for the compounds involved in the reaction are as follows:\n\nΔHf° (CH4) = -74.8 kJ/mol\nΔHf° (O2) = 0 kJ/mol (since O2 is an element in its standard state)\nΔHf° (CO2) = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔHf° (H2O) = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change for the reaction (ΔHr°) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nΔHr° = Σ [ΔHf° (products)] - Σ [ΔHf° (reactants)]\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\nΔHr° = [1 × ΔHf° (CO2) + 2 × ΔHf° (H2O)] - [1 × ΔHf° (CH4) + 2 × ΔHf° (O2)]\n\nΔHr° = [1 × (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 × (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [1 × (-74.8 kJ/mol) + 2 × (0 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔHr° = (-393.5 - 571.6 + 74.8) kJ/mol\n\nΔHr° = -890.3 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change for the combustion of methane gas (CH4) at standard conditions is -890.3 kJ/mol."
