    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of moles and the balanced chemical equation for the neutralization reaction between sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and hydrochloric acid (HCl):\n\nNaOH + HCl → NaCl + H2O\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of NaOH reacts with 1 mole of HCl. \n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of HCl in the 25.0 mL of 0.125 M solution:\n\nmoles of HCl = volume (L) × concentration (M)\nmoles of HCl = 0.025 L × 0.125 M = 0.003125 moles\n\nSince 1 mole of NaOH reacts with 1 mole of HCl, we need 0.003125 moles of NaOH to neutralize the HCl. Now, we can find the volume of 0.100 M NaOH solution required:\n\nvolume (L) = moles of NaOH / concentration (M)\nvolume (L) = 0.003125 moles / 0.100 M = 0.03125 L\n\nTo convert the volume to milliliters, we can multiply by 1000:\n\nvolume (mL) = 0.03125 L × 1000 = 31.25 mL\n\nSo, 31.25 mL of 0.100 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is required to neutralize 25.0 mL of 0.125 M hydrochloric acid (HCl)."
