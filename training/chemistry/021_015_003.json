    "message_2": "The molecular geometry of the water molecule (H2O) is bent or V-shaped. The bond angle between the two hydrogen atoms and the central oxygen atom is approximately 104.5 degrees. This is due to the presence of two lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen atom, which repel the bonding pairs of electrons, causing the H-O-H angle to be smaller than the typical tetrahedral angle of 109.5 degrees."
