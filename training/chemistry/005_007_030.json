    "message_2": "The process of RNA transcription and translation enables the cellular machinery to synthesize proteins by converting the genetic information stored in DNA into functional proteins. This process occurs in two main steps: transcription and translation.\n\nTranscription:\n1. Initiation: The process begins when the enzyme RNA polymerase binds to a specific DNA sequence called the promoter region, which is located near the gene to be transcribed. This binding event signals the start of transcription.\n\n2. Elongation: RNA polymerase unwinds the DNA double helix and reads the template strand in the 3' to 5' direction. As it moves along the DNA, it synthesizes a complementary RNA molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA) in the 5' to 3' direction. The mRNA is built using ribonucleotide triphosphates (rNTPs) as building blocks, which are complementary to the DNA template (A pairs with U, and C pairs with G).\n\n3. Termination: Transcription continues until RNA polymerase reaches a specific DNA sequence called the terminator region. At this point, the RNA polymerase, the newly synthesized mRNA, and the DNA template dissociate from each other, marking the end of transcription.\n\nTranslation:\n1. Initiation: The process of translation begins when the mRNA molecule binds to a ribosome, a complex molecular machine composed of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and proteins. The ribosome recognizes the start codon (AUG) on the mRNA and recruits a transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule carrying the corresponding amino acid (methionine). The tRNA molecule has an anticodon sequence that is complementary to the mRNA codon. This tRNA binds to the ribosome's P site.\n\n2. Elongation: The ribosome moves along the mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction, reading the codons (three-nucleotide sequences) and recruiting the appropriate tRNA molecules carrying the corresponding amino acids. Each tRNA molecule has an anticodon that is complementary to the mRNA codon. The amino acids are joined together by peptide bonds, forming a growing polypeptide chain. The ribosome has three sites: A (aminoacyl), P (peptidyl), and E (exit). The tRNA carrying the growing polypeptide chain moves from the A site to the P site, and the empty tRNA moves to the E site before being released.\n\n3. Termination: Translation continues until the ribosome encounters a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) on the mRNA. These codons do not code for any amino acids, so no tRNA molecules can bind to them. Instead, a protein called a release factor binds to the stop codon, causing the ribosome to release the completed polypeptide chain and dissociate from the mRNA.\n\nAfter translation, the newly synthesized protein may undergo further modifications, such as folding or the addition of other molecules, to become fully functional. In this way, the processes of transcription and translation enable the cellular machinery to synthesize proteins based on the genetic information stored in DNA."
