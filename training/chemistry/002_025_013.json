    "message_2": "The magnetic moment (µ) of a molecule can be calculated using the formula:\n\nµ = √(n(n+2)) µB\n\nwhere n is the number of unpaired electrons and µB is the Bohr magneton (approximately 9.274 x 10^-24 J/T).\n\nFor FeCl3 in a high-spin state with five unpaired electrons, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nµ = √(5(5+2)) µB\nµ = √(5(7)) µB\nµ = √(35) µB\n\nNow, we can multiply by the value of the Bohr magneton:\n\nµ ≈ √(35) x (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T)\nµ ≈ 5.92 x (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T)\nµ ≈ 5.49 x 10^-23 J/T\n\nSo, the magnetic moment of FeCl3 in a high-spin state with five unpaired electrons is approximately 5.49 x 10^-23 J/T."
