    "message_2": "To predict the reactivity of inorganic compounds, we can consider their electronic configurations and the periodic trends such as electronegativity, ionization energy, and electron affinity. Here's an analysis of the given compounds:\n\n1. Calcium chloride (CaCl2)\nCalcium (Ca) has an electronic configuration of [Ar] 4s². It readily loses two electrons to form Ca²⁺ ion. Chlorine (Cl) has an electronic configuration of [Ne] 3s² 3p⁵ and gains one electron to form Cl⁻ ion. The ionic bond between Ca²⁺ and Cl⁻ ions makes CaCl2 a highly reactive compound, especially with water, as it dissociates into its ions, making it a strong electrolyte.\n\n2. Iron oxide (FeO)\nIron (Fe) has an electronic configuration of [Ar] 3d⁶ 4s². It can lose two electrons to form Fe²⁺ ion. Oxygen (O) has an electronic configuration of [He] 2s² 2p⁴ and gains two electrons to form O²⁻ ion. The ionic bond between Fe²⁺ and O²⁻ ions makes FeO a moderately reactive compound. It can react with acids to form iron salts and water, and it can also be reduced to metallic iron in high-temperature environments.\n\n3. Copper sulfate (CuSO4)\nCopper (Cu) has an electronic configuration of [Ar] 3d¹⁰ 4s¹. It can lose two electrons to form Cu²⁺ ion. The sulfate ion (SO₄²⁻) is a polyatomic ion with sulfur (S) having an electronic configuration of [Ne] 3s² 3p⁴ and oxygen (O) having an electronic configuration of [He] 2s² 2p⁴. CuSO4 is a highly reactive compound, especially with water, as it forms hydrated copper sulfate (CuSO4·5H2O) which is a strong electrolyte. It can also undergo redox reactions with metals and other reducing agents.\n\n4. Aluminum nitrate (Al(NO3)3)\nAluminum (Al) has an electronic configuration of [Ne] 3s² 3p¹. It can lose three electrons to form Al³⁺ ion. The nitrate ion (NO₃⁻) is a polyatomic ion with nitrogen (N) having an electronic configuration of [He] 2s² 2p³ and oxygen (O) having an electronic configuration of [He] 2s² 2p⁴. Al(NO3)3 is a highly reactive compound, especially with water, as it dissociates into its ions, making it a strong electrolyte. It can also react with bases to form aluminum hydroxide and nitrates."
