    "message_2": "To determine the amount of acetylsalicylic acid that can be prepared from the given amounts of salicylic acid and acetic anhydride, we need to first find the limiting reagent and then use stoichiometry to calculate the amount of product formed.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the preparation of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is:\n\nC7H6O3 (salicylic acid) + C4H6O3 (acetic anhydride) → C9H8O4 (acetylsalicylic acid) + C2H4O2 (acetic acid)\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of each reactant:\n\nMolar mass of salicylic acid (C7H6O3) = (7 × 12.01) + (6 × 1.01) + (3 × 16.00) = 138.12 g/mol\nMoles of salicylic acid = 10 g / 138.12 g/mol = 0.0724 mol\n\nMolar mass of acetic anhydride (C4H6O3) = (4 × 12.01) + (6 × 1.01) + (3 × 16.00) = 102.09 g/mol\nMoles of acetic anhydride = 15 g / 102.09 g/mol = 0.1469 mol\n\nNow, we need to find the limiting reagent. The stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, so we can compare the moles of the reactants directly:\n\nSalicylic acid: 0.0724 mol\nAcetic anhydride: 0.1469 mol\n\nSince there are fewer moles of salicylic acid, it is the limiting reagent.\n\nNow, we can use stoichiometry to find the moles of acetylsalicylic acid produced:\n\n0.0724 mol salicylic acid × (1 mol acetylsalicylic acid / 1 mol salicylic acid) = 0.0724 mol acetylsalicylic acid\n\nFinally, we can convert the moles of acetylsalicylic acid to grams:\n\nMolar mass of acetylsalicylic acid (C9H8O4) = (9 × 12.01) + (8 × 1.01) + (4 × 16.00) = 180.16 g/mol\nMass of acetylsalicylic acid = 0.0724 mol × 180.16 g/mol = 13.04 g\n\nTherefore, 13.04 grams of acetylsalicylic acid can be prepared from 10 grams of salicylic acid and 15 grams of acetic anhydride under the given reaction conditions."
