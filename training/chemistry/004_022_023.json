    "message_2": "To determine the concentration of lead ions in a given sample of drinking water using the potentiometry technique, you will need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Prepare the sample: Collect a representative sample of the drinking water and filter it to remove any suspended particles. This will ensure accurate measurements.\n\n2. Calibration: Prepare a series of standard solutions containing known concentrations of lead ions (Pb2+). These solutions will be used to create a calibration curve, which will help determine the concentration of lead ions in the drinking water sample.\n\n3. Set up the potentiometer: Connect a lead ion-selective electrode (ISE) and a reference electrode to a potentiometer. The lead ISE will respond specifically to the presence of lead ions, while the reference electrode will provide a stable reference potential.\n\n4. Measure the potential: Immerse the electrodes in each of the standard solutions, starting with the lowest concentration. Record the potential (voltage) readings for each solution. Rinse the electrodes thoroughly with distilled water between each measurement to avoid cross-contamination.\n\n5. Create a calibration curve: Plot the potential readings against the known concentrations of lead ions in the standard solutions. The resulting curve should be linear, and its equation can be used to determine the concentration of lead ions in the drinking water sample.\n\n6. Measure the sample: Immerse the electrodes in the drinking water sample and record the potential reading. Rinse the electrodes thoroughly with distilled water before and after the measurement.\n\n7. Calculate the concentration: Use the calibration curve equation to determine the concentration of lead ions in the drinking water sample based on its potential reading.\n\nKeep in mind that the accuracy of this method depends on the quality of the electrodes, the calibration curve, and the proper handling of the sample. Additionally, interferences from other ions present in the sample may affect the results, so it is essential to use an ion-selective electrode with high selectivity for lead ions."
