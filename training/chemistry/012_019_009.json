    "message_2": "To modify the traditional hydrothermal synthesis method for the development of a more sustainable and cost-effective method for synthesizing zeolites with improved adsorption properties, we can consider the following approaches:\n\n1. Utilize alternative and sustainable raw materials: Instead of using traditional sources like sodium silicate and aluminum sulfate, explore the use of waste materials such as fly ash, rice husk ash, or red mud as sources of silica and alumina. This will not only reduce the cost of raw materials but also contribute to waste management and environmental sustainability.\n\n2. Reduce energy consumption: Traditional hydrothermal synthesis often requires high temperatures and pressures. Investigate the use of low-temperature and ambient pressure methods, such as room temperature synthesis, microwave-assisted synthesis, or sonochemical synthesis, to reduce energy consumption and costs.\n\n3. Optimize synthesis parameters: Perform a systematic study of the effects of various synthesis parameters, such as temperature, pressure, time, pH, and precursor concentrations, on the zeolite properties. This will help identify the optimal conditions for obtaining zeolites with improved adsorption properties while minimizing the use of resources and energy.\n\n4. Develop template-free synthesis methods: Traditional zeolite synthesis often involves the use of organic templates, which can be expensive and environmentally harmful. Investigate the development of template-free synthesis methods or the use of more sustainable and cost-effective templates, such as bio-based templates or recyclable templates.\n\n5. Improve post-synthesis treatments: Investigate alternative methods for removing impurities and unreacted precursors from the synthesized zeolites, such as solvent extraction, supercritical fluid extraction, or membrane separation. These methods can potentially reduce the amount of water and chemicals needed for purification, thus reducing the environmental impact and cost.\n\n6. Enhance adsorption properties through modification: Investigate the modification of synthesized zeolites through ion exchange, surface functionalization, or incorporation of other materials (e.g., metal nanoparticles) to improve their adsorption properties for specific applications.\n\n7. Scale-up and industrial application: Develop scalable and cost-effective methods for the large-scale production of zeolites with improved adsorption properties. This may involve the use of continuous flow reactors, microwave-assisted reactors, or other advanced synthesis techniques.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, it is possible to develop a more sustainable and cost-effective method for the synthesis of zeolites with improved adsorption properties, contributing to the advancement of various applications, such as gas separation, catalysis, and environmental remediation."
