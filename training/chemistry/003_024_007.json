    "message_1": "What is the rate law expression for the gas phase reaction between hydrogen and iodine gases at a constant temperature according to the following mechanism: \n\nH2(g) + I2(g) → 2HI(g) \n\nRate-determining step: H2(g) + I2(g) → 2HI(g) + M \n\nwhere M is a third body or a catalyst?",
    "message_2": "The rate law expression for a reaction is determined by the rate-determining step, which is the slowest step in the reaction mechanism. In this case, the rate-determining step is given as:\n\nH2(g) + I2(g) → 2HI(g) + M\n\nSince the rate-determining step involves the reaction between hydrogen (H2) and iodine (I2) gases, the rate law expression will be proportional to the concentrations of these reactants. The rate law expression for this reaction is:\n\nRate = k [H2] [I2]\n\nwhere Rate is the reaction rate, k is the rate constant, and [H2] and [I2] are the concentrations of hydrogen and iodine gases, respectively."
