    "message_2": "Caffeine is an alkaloid with the molecular formula C8H10N4O2. To determine the percentage composition of nitrogen (N), carbon (C), and hydrogen (H) in caffeine, we will first need to calculate the molar mass of caffeine and then the mass percentage of each element.\n\n1. Calculate the molar mass of caffeine:\nC: 12.01 g/mol (8 atoms) = 96.08 g/mol\nH: 1.01 g/mol (10 atoms) = 10.10 g/mol\nN: 14.01 g/mol (4 atoms) = 56.04 g/mol\nO: 16.00 g/mol (2 atoms) = 32.00 g/mol\n\nTotal molar mass of caffeine = 96.08 + 10.10 + 56.04 + 32.00 = 194.22 g/mol\n\n2. Calculate the mass percentage of each element:\nCarbon (C): (96.08 g/mol / 194.22 g/mol) × 100% = 49.48%\nHydrogen (H): (10.10 g/mol / 194.22 g/mol) × 100% = 5.20%\nNitrogen (N): (56.04 g/mol / 194.22 g/mol) × 100% = 28.85%\n\nSo, the percentage composition of the caffeine sample obtained from coffee beans is approximately 49.48% carbon, 5.20% hydrogen, and 28.85% nitrogen."
