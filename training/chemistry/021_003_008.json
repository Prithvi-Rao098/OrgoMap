    "message_2": "The molecular geometry of a water molecule (H2O) is bent or V-shaped, with the oxygen atom as the central atom. The hybridization of the central oxygen atom is sp3, which means it has four electron domains (two lone pairs and two bonding pairs with hydrogen atoms).\n\nAccording to the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory, the electron domains will arrange themselves to minimize repulsion, resulting in a tetrahedral arrangement. However, since the water molecule has two lone pairs, the bond angle between the two hydrogen atoms will be slightly less than the ideal tetrahedral angle of 109.5 degrees.\n\nThe predicted bond angle in a water molecule is approximately 104.5 degrees."
