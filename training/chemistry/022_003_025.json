    "message_2": "To find the molarity of the hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution, we can use the concept of stoichiometry and the balanced chemical equation for the neutralization reaction between sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and hydrochloric acid (HCl):\n\nNaOH + HCl → NaCl + H2O\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that the mole ratio between NaOH and HCl is 1:1.\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of NaOH used in the reaction:\n\nmoles of NaOH = Molarity × Volume\nmoles of NaOH = 0.5 M × 0.025 L (converting 25 ml to liters)\nmoles of NaOH = 0.0125 moles\n\nSince the mole ratio between NaOH and HCl is 1:1, the moles of HCl needed for the reaction are equal to the moles of NaOH:\n\nmoles of HCl = 0.0125 moles\n\nNow, we can find the molarity of the HCl solution:\n\nMolarity of HCl = moles of HCl / Volume of HCl solution\nMolarity of HCl = 0.0125 moles / 0.035 L (converting 35 ml to liters)\nMolarity of HCl ≈ 0.357 M\n\nSo, the molarity of the hydrochloric acid solution is approximately 0.357 M."
