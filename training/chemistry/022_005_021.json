    "message_2": "To calculate the heat released during the complete combustion of methane, we need to use the balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane and the heat of combustion (ΔH) value.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane is:\n\nCH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(l)\n\nThe heat of combustion (ΔH) for methane is -890 kJ/mol.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of methane (20 grams) to moles. The molar mass of methane (CH4) is 12.01 g/mol (C) + 4 * 1.01 g/mol (H) = 16.05 g/mol.\n\nMoles of methane = mass / molar mass = 20 g / 16.05 g/mol = 1.246 moles\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat released:\n\nHeat released = moles of methane * heat of combustion\nHeat released = 1.246 moles * -890 kJ/mol = -1108.94 kJ\n\nTherefore, 1108.94 kJ of heat is released during the complete combustion of 20 grams of methane."
