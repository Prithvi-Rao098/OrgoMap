    "message_2": "When sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) reacts with calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)₂), the products formed are calcium sulfate (CaSO₄) and water (H₂O). The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nH₂SO₄ + Ca(OH)₂ → CaSO₄ + 2H₂O\n\nThis reaction is an example of an acid-base neutralization reaction, which is generally exothermic. In this case, heat is released as the strong acid (H₂SO₄) and the strong base (Ca(OH)₂) combine to form a salt (CaSO₄) and water."
