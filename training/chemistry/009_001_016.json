    "message_2": "To determine the amount of iodine-131 remaining after 24 days, we can use the formula:\n\nFinal amount = Initial amount * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial amount is 100 grams, the time elapsed is 24 days, and the half-life is 8 days. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal amount = 100 * (1/2)^(24 / 8)\n\nFinal amount = 100 * (1/2)^3\n\nFinal amount = 100 * (1/8)\n\nFinal amount = 12.5 grams\n\nSo, after 24 days, 12.5 grams of iodine-131 will remain."
