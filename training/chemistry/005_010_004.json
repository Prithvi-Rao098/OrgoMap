    "message_2": "The activity of the enzyme catalase in potatoes, like other enzymes, is affected by pH levels. Catalase is responsible for breaking down hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into water (H2O) and oxygen (O2) in cells, which helps protect cells from oxidative damage caused by reactive oxygen species.\n\nEnzymes generally have an optimal pH range in which they function most efficiently. For catalase, the optimal pH range is typically between 7 and 8, which is around neutral pH. This is because the enzyme's structure and active site are most stable and effective in this pH range.\n\nWhen the pH deviates from the optimal range, the enzyme's activity can decrease. At extremely acidic or alkaline pH levels, the enzyme's structure can become denatured, leading to a loss of function. In the case of catalase, its activity tends to decrease significantly below pH 6 and above pH 9.\n\nIn summary, the activity of the enzyme catalase in potatoes is affected by pH levels, with optimal activity occurring at a neutral pH range of 7-8. Deviations from this range can lead to decreased enzyme activity and potential loss of function due to denaturation."
