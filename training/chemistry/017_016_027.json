    "message_2": "Designing luminescent materials with high quantum yield and tunable emission properties for various applications can be achieved through the following strategies:\n\n1. Selection of appropriate materials: Choose materials with high quantum yield, such as quantum dots, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), lanthanide-doped materials, and organic fluorophores. These materials have unique optical properties that can be tailored for specific applications.\n\n2. Control of size and shape: The size and shape of luminescent materials can significantly influence their emission properties. For example, quantum dots exhibit size-dependent emission properties, where smaller dots emit shorter wavelengths (blue light) and larger dots emit longer wavelengths (red light). By controlling the size and shape of these materials, their emission properties can be tuned for specific applications.\n\n3. Surface modification: Surface modification of luminescent materials can enhance their quantum yield and tune their emission properties. For example, passivating the surface of quantum dots with organic ligands can improve their quantum yield and stability. Additionally, surface modification can introduce functional groups that enable the attachment of other molecules, such as biomolecules for biosensing applications.\n\n4. Doping and alloying: Doping luminescent materials with other elements or creating alloys can alter their emission properties. For example, doping lanthanide-based materials with different lanthanide ions can result in tunable emission properties, while alloying quantum dots can lead to the formation of gradient alloy quantum dots with tunable emission properties.\n\n5. Design of energy transfer systems: Designing luminescent materials with efficient energy transfer systems can improve their quantum yield and tunable emission properties. For example, FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) can be used to transfer energy between donor and acceptor molecules, enabling the tuning of emission properties.\n\n6. Use of host-guest systems: Incorporating luminescent materials into host-guest systems, such as MOFs or supramolecular assemblies, can enhance their quantum yield and tunable emission properties. The host-guest interactions can influence the electronic structure of the luminescent materials, leading to changes in their emission properties.\n\n7. Computational modeling and simulation: Utilize computational methods, such as density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT, to predict and optimize the electronic and optical properties of luminescent materials. This can guide the design of materials with high quantum yield and tunable emission properties.\n\nBy employing these strategies, luminescent materials with high quantum yield and tunable emission properties can be designed for various applications, including sensing, imaging, lighting, and displays."
