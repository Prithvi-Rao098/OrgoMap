    "message_2": "To calculate the heat of hydration for the given amount of calcium chloride, we first need to determine the number of moles of calcium chloride in 50 grams.\n\nThe molar mass of calcium chloride (CaCl2) is:\nCa = 40.08 g/mol\nCl = 35.45 g/mol (but there are 2 chlorine atoms in CaCl2, so we multiply by 2)\n\nMolar mass of CaCl2 = 40.08 + (2 × 35.45) = 40.08 + 70.9 = 110.98 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the number of moles of calcium chloride in 50 grams:\nmoles = mass / molar mass = 50 g / 110.98 g/mol = 0.4505 mol\n\nNow that we have the number of moles, we can calculate the heat of hydration for this amount of calcium chloride using the given heat of hydration value (-82.8 kJ/mol):\n\nHeat of hydration = moles × heat of hydration per mole\nHeat of hydration = 0.4505 mol × (-82.8 kJ/mol) = -37.3 kJ\n\nSo, the heat of hydration of 50 grams of calcium chloride when dissolved in 200 mL of water at 25°C is -37.3 kJ."
