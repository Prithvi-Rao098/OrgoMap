    "message_1": "What effect will be observed on the ionization of a weak base when a strong acid is added to the solution?",
    "message_2": "When a strong acid is added to the solution containing a weak base, the ionization of the weak base will be affected. The strong acid will donate protons (H+ ions) to the solution, which will react with the weak base, forming its conjugate acid and decreasing the concentration of the weak base.\n\nAs a result, the equilibrium of the weak base ionization will shift to the right, trying to counteract the decrease in the weak base concentration. This will lead to an increase in the ionization of the weak base, producing more of its conjugate acid and hydroxide ions (OH-). However, the overall pH of the solution will decrease due to the presence of the strong acid."
