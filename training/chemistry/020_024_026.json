    "message_1": "What will be the effect on the equilibrium position of the redox reaction between iodine and arsenic acid when a catalyst is added? Calculate the new value of the equilibrium constant (Kc) if the initial concentration of iodine, arsenic acid, and catalyst are given as 0.1 M, 0.2 M, and 0.3 M, respectively.",
    "message_2": "The addition of a catalyst to a reaction does not affect the equilibrium position or the equilibrium constant (Kc) of the reaction. Catalysts only increase the rate at which the reaction reaches equilibrium by lowering the activation energy of the reaction, but they do not change the concentrations of the reactants and products at equilibrium.\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the redox reaction between iodine and arsenic acid will remain the same even after the addition of the catalyst. The initial concentrations of iodine, arsenic acid, and catalyst do not affect the value of Kc."
