(The molar absorptivity of iron (II) ions at 565 nm is 1.9 x 10^4 L/mol cm).",
    "message_2": "To find the concentration of iron (II) ions in the water sample, we can use the Beer-Lambert Law, which states:\n\nA = ε * c * l\n\nwhere A is the absorbance, ε is the molar absorptivity, c is the concentration of the solution, and l is the path length of the cuvette.\n\nWe are given the following values:\n\nA = 0.842\nε = 1.9 x 10^4 L/mol cm\nl = 1 cm\n\nWe need to find the concentration (c) of iron (II) ions in the water sample. Rearranging the Beer-Lambert Law equation to solve for c, we get:\n\nc = A / (ε * l)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nc = 0.842 / (1.9 x 10^4 L/mol cm * 1 cm)\n\nc = 0.842 / 1.9 x 10^4 L/mol\n\nc = 4.4316 x 10^-5 mol/L\n\nTherefore, the concentration of iron (II) ions in the water sample is approximately 4.43 x 10^-5 mol/L."
