    "message_2": "In the compound HNO3 (nitric acid), the oxidation state of nitrogen can be determined using the oxidation states of hydrogen and oxygen and the overall charge of the compound.\n\nThe oxidation state of hydrogen is +1, and there are 1 hydrogen atom in the compound. So, the total oxidation state for hydrogen is +1.\n\nThe oxidation state of oxygen is -2, and there are 3 oxygen atoms in the compound. So, the total oxidation state for oxygen is -6.\n\nThe overall charge of the compound is 0 (since it is a neutral molecule).\n\nLet x be the oxidation state of nitrogen. We can set up the following equation:\n\n(+1) + x + (-6) = 0\n\nx - 5 = 0\n\nx = 5\n\nSo, the oxidation state of nitrogen in HNO3 is +5."
