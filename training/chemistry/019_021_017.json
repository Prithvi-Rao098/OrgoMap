    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the formula:\n\nΔH° = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH° is the standard enthalpy change, and ΔHf° is the standard enthalpy of formation.\n\nFor the products:\n2 mol Fe(s): 2 × 0 kJ/mol = 0 kJ\n3 mol CO2(g): 3 × (-393.5 kJ/mol) = -1180.5 kJ\n\nFor the reactants:\n1 mol Fe2O3(s): 1 × (-825.5 kJ/mol) = -825.5 kJ\n3 mol CO(g): 3 × (-110.5 kJ/mol) = -331.5 kJ\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nΔH° = (0 kJ + (-1180.5 kJ)) - ((-825.5 kJ) + (-331.5 kJ))\nΔH° = (-1180.5 kJ) - (-1157 kJ)\nΔH° = -23.5 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the reaction at 298 K is -23.5 kJ."
