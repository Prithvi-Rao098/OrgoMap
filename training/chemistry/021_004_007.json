    "message_2": "The hybridization of the carbon atom in a methane (CH4) molecule is sp3. In methane, the carbon atom forms four sigma bonds with four hydrogen atoms. To accommodate these bonds, the carbon's 2s and three 2p orbitals hybridize to form four sp3 hybrid orbitals, which are then used to form the four C-H bonds."
