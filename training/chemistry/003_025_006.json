    "message_2": "To write the equilibrium constant (Kc) expression for the given reversible reaction:\n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g)\n\nWe use the formula:\n\nKc = [products] / [reactants]\n\nFor this reaction, the Kc expression will be:\n\nKc = [NH3]^2 / ([N2] * [H2]^3)\n\nNow, we are given the initial concentrations of N2, H2, and NH3:\n\n[N2] = 0.2 M\n[H2] = 0.3 M\n[NH3] = 0.1 M\n\nHowever, we are not given the equilibrium concentrations, so we cannot directly calculate the value of Kc. We need more information, such as the reaction quotient (Qc) or the change in concentration during the reaction, to determine the equilibrium concentrations and calculate Kc."
