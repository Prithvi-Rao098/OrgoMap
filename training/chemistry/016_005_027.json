    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of 1 mole of methane gas, we need to use the balanced chemical equation for the combustion reaction:\n\nCH₄(g) + 2O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l)\n\nNow, we can use Hess's Law, which states that the enthalpy change for a reaction is equal to the sum of the enthalpy changes for the products minus the sum of the enthalpy changes for the reactants.\n\nΔH = [ΔHf(CO₂) + 2ΔHf(H₂O)] - [ΔHf(CH₄) + 2ΔHf(O₂)]\n\nSince O₂ is an element in its standard state, its enthalpy of formation is zero. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\nΔH = [ΔHf(CO₂) + 2ΔHf(H₂O)] - ΔHf(CH₄)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given enthalpy values:\n\nΔH = [(-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2(-285.8 kJ/mol)] - (-74.8 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH = (-393.5 - 571.6 + 74.8) kJ/mol\n\nΔH = -890.3 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change for the combustion of 1 mole of methane gas at standard conditions is -890.3 kJ/mol."
