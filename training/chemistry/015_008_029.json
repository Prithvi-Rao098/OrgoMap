    "message_2": "The selectivity of a chemical reaction refers to the preference for the formation of one product over another in a reaction involving multiple possible products. Several factors influence the selectivity of a chemical reaction, including:\n\n1. Steric factors: The size and shape of the reactants can affect the accessibility of reactive sites, leading to preferential formation of certain products.\n\n2. Electronic factors: The distribution of electron density in the reactants can influence the reactivity of different sites, affecting the selectivity of the reaction.\n\n3. Reaction conditions: Factors such as temperature, pressure, solvent, and catalysts can influence the selectivity of a reaction by affecting the stability of intermediates or transition states.\n\n4. Reaction mechanism: The pathway through which a reaction proceeds can determine the selectivity of the reaction. Different mechanisms may lead to different products.\n\nTo predict the outcome of a chemical reaction using quantum chemistry calculations, one can follow these general steps:\n\n1. Construct a molecular model: Create a computational model of the reactants, including their atomic positions and electronic configurations.\n\n2. Choose a quantum chemistry method: Select an appropriate computational method to describe the electronic structure of the molecules, such as Hartree-Fock, density functional theory (DFT), or post-Hartree-Fock methods like configuration interaction (CI) and coupled-cluster (CC) theory.\n\n3. Calculate the potential energy surface: Perform calculations to obtain the potential energy surface (PES) of the reaction, which describes the energy of the system as a function of the atomic positions.\n\n4. Identify transition states and intermediates: Analyze the PES to identify possible transition states and intermediates along the reaction pathway.\n\n5. Calculate reaction rates and selectivity: Use the calculated energies and geometries of the reactants, transition states, and products to estimate reaction rates and selectivity using transition state theory or other kinetics models.\n\n6. Validate the predictions: Compare the predicted reaction outcomes with experimental data to validate the accuracy of the quantum chemistry calculations.\n\nBy following these steps, quantum chemistry calculations can help predict the selectivity of chemical reactions and guide the design of more efficient and selective synthetic routes."
