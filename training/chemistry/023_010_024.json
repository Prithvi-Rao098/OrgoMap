    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of limiting reagents and stoichiometry. First, let's write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nN₂H₄ + C₆H₃Cl(NO₂)₂ → C₆H₃(NO₂)₂N₂H₃ + HCl\n\nNow, we need to determine the molar mass of each reactant:\n\nMolar mass of hydrazine (N₂H₄) = (2 × 14.01) + (4 × 1.01) = 32.05 g/mol\nMolar mass of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (C₆H₃Cl(NO₂)₂) = (6 × 12.01) + (3 × 1.01) + 35.45 + (2 × (14.01 + (2 × 16.00))) = 202.56 g/mol\n\nNext, we need to calculate the moles of each reactant:\n\nMoles of hydrazine = 5 g / 32.05 g/mol = 0.156 moles\nMoles of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene = 10 g / 202.56 g/mol = 0.049 moles\n\nNow, we need to determine the limiting reagent. Since the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, we can compare the moles of each reactant:\n\n0.156 moles of hydrazine / 1 = 0.156\n0.049 moles of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene / 1 = 0.049\n\nSince 0.049 is smaller than 0.156, 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene is the limiting reagent.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the moles of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (C₆H₃(NO₂)₂N₂H₃) that can be produced:\n\nMoles of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine = 0.049 moles (from the limiting reagent)\n\nNow, we need to determine the molar mass of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine:\n\nMolar mass of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine = (6 × 12.01) + (3 × 1.01) + (2 × 14.01) + (2 × (2 × 16.00)) = 198.14 g/mol\n\nFinally, we can calculate the mass of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine that can be produced:\n\nMass of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine = 0.049 moles × 198.14 g/mol = 9.72 g\n\nTherefore, 9.72 grams of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine can be produced from the given amounts of reactants."
