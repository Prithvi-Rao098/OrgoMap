    "message_2": "Sulfur dioxide (SO2) has a molecular formula of one sulfur atom (S) and two oxygen atoms (O). To determine its molecular geometry, we first need to look at the valence electrons of sulfur and oxygen.\n\nSulfur has 6 valence electrons, and each oxygen atom has 6 valence electrons. In SO2, sulfur forms double bonds with each of the two oxygen atoms. This accounts for 4 of sulfur's valence electrons, and the remaining 2 electrons form a lone pair on the sulfur atom.\n\nThe molecular geometry of SO2 can be described as a bent or angular shape due to the presence of the lone pair on the sulfur atom, which repels the oxygen atoms and causes the O-S-O bond angle to be less than 180 degrees. The bond angle is approximately 119 degrees.\n\nAs for polarity, SO2 is a polar molecule. This is because the oxygen atoms are more electronegative than the sulfur atom, creating a difference in electronegativity between the S-O bonds. This results in a net dipole moment, making the molecule polar. The lone pair on the sulfur atom also contributes to the overall polarity of the molecule."
