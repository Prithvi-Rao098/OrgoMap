    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy of formation for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), we need to know the standard enthalpy change of the reaction that forms it. The formation reaction for hydrogen peroxide can be written as:\n\nH2 (g) + O2 (g) → H2O2 (l)\n\nHowever, we don't have the direct enthalpy change for this reaction. We can use Hess's Law to find it indirectly by using the enthalpy changes of formation for water and oxygen gas. We can write two reactions that involve these compounds:\n\n1) H2 (g) + 1/2 O2 (g) → H2O (l)  ΔH1 = -285.8 kJ/mol\n2) H2O (l) + 1/2 O2 (g) → H2O2 (l)  ΔH2 = ?\n\nWe want to find the enthalpy change for reaction 2. To do this, we can manipulate reaction 1 and add it to reaction 2 to get the desired reaction. We can reverse reaction 1 and multiply it by 1:\n\n1') H2O (l) → H2 (g) + 1/2 O2 (g)  ΔH1' = 285.8 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can add reaction 1' and reaction 2:\n\n1') H2O (l) → H2 (g) + 1/2 O2 (g)  ΔH1' = 285.8 kJ/mol\n2) H2O (l) + 1/2 O2 (g) → H2O2 (l)  ΔH2 = ?\n\n----------------------------------------------\nH2 (g) + O2 (g) → H2O2 (l)  ΔH = ΔH1' + ΔH2\n\nNow we can solve for ΔH2:\n\nΔH2 = ΔH - ΔH1'\nΔH2 = 0 kJ/mol - 285.8 kJ/mol\nΔH2 = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy of formation for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) at 298 K is -285.8 kJ/mol."
