    "message_2": "The Lewis structure for carbon dioxide (CO2) is:\n\nO=C=O\n\nIn this structure, the central carbon atom is double-bonded to each oxygen atom. The carbon atom has four valence electrons, and each oxygen atom has six valence electrons. The double bonds between the carbon and oxygen atoms account for the sharing of four electrons (two from each atom), satisfying the octet rule for all atoms involved.\n\nThe molecular geometry of CO2 is linear. This is because the central carbon atom has two electron domains (the double bonds with the oxygen atoms) and no lone pairs, resulting in a 180-degree bond angle between the oxygen atoms. The official name for this type of molecular geometry is linear."
