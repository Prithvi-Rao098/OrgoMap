    "message_2": "To calculate the activation energy (Ea) of a reaction, we can use the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk = A * e^(-Ea / RT)\n\nwhere k is the rate constant, A is the pre-exponential factor, Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nHowever, we don't have enough information to directly use the Arrhenius equation. Instead, we can use the temperature coefficient (Q10) to find the activation energy. The Q10 is the factor by which the reaction rate increases for every 10°C increase in temperature:\n\nQ10 = (k2 / k1)^(10 / (T2 - T1))\n\nwhere k1 and k2 are the rate constants at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively. In this case, we have the rate constant at 25°C (k1 = 3.42 x 10^-3 s^-1) and the temperature coefficient (Q10 = 1.99). We can assume that k2 is the rate constant at 35°C (T2 = 308.15 K), and T1 is 25°C (298.15 K).\n\n1.99 = (k2 / (3.42 x 10^-3 s^-1))^(10 / (308.15 K - 298.15 K))\n\nSolving for k2:\n\nk2 = 1.99^(1) * (3.42 x 10^-3 s^-1) = 6.81 x 10^-3 s^-1\n\nNow we have the rate constants at two different temperatures. We can use the Arrhenius equation to find the activation energy:\n\nk1 = A * e^(-Ea / (R * T1))\nk2 = A * e^(-Ea / (R * T2))\n\nDivide the first equation by the second equation:\n\n(k1 / k2) = e^((Ea / (R * T2)) - (Ea / (R * T1)))\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(k1 / k2) = (Ea / (R * T2)) - (Ea / (R * T1))\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for Ea:\n\nEa = R * (ln(k1 / k2) / (1/T1 - 1/T2))\n\nPlug in the values:\n\nEa = 8.314 J/mol·K * (ln((3.42 x 10^-3 s^-1) / (6.81 x 10^-3 s^-1)) / (1/298.15 K - 1/308.15 K))\n\nEa ≈ 48,200 J/mol\n\nThe activation energy of the reaction between hydrochloric acid and zinc is approximately 48,200 J/mol."
