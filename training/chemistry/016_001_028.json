    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy of formation (ΔH°f) of carbon dioxide (CO2), we can use the given reactions and their respective enthalpies. We want to find the enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nC(s) + O2(g) → CO2(g)\n\nWe can use the given reactions to create a reaction pathway that leads to the formation of CO2 from its elements in their standard states. The first reaction is:\n\nCO(g) + 1/2 O2(g) → CO2(g)    ΔH° = -283.3 kJ/mol\n\nWe can reverse this reaction to get:\n\nCO2(g) → CO(g) + 1/2 O2(g)    ΔH° = +283.3 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can add the second given reaction:\n\nC(s) + O2(g) → CO2(g)            ΔH° = -393.5 kJ/mol\n\nAdding the two reactions together, we get:\n\nCO2(g) → CO(g) + 1/2 O2(g)    ΔH° = +283.3 kJ/mol\nC(s) + O2(g) → CO2(g)            ΔH° = -393.5 kJ/mol\n---------------------------------------------\nC(s) + 1/2 O2(g) → CO(g)       ΔH° = -110.2 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can reverse this reaction to get the formation of CO2 from its elements:\n\nCO(g) + 1/2 O2(g) → C(s) + O2(g)    ΔH° = +110.2 kJ/mol\n\nSince the enthalpy of formation of C(s) and O2(g) are both 0 kJ/mol, the standard enthalpy of formation (ΔH°f) of carbon dioxide (CO2) at 25°C is:\n\nΔH°f (CO2) = -393.5 kJ/mol"
