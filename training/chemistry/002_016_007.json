    "message_2": "To calculate the change in enthalpy (ΔH) and entropy (ΔS) for the reaction, we need the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) and standard entropies (S°) for all the substances involved in the reaction. However, you have only provided the standard enthalpies of formation for NiCl2(aq) and H2(g), and the standard enthalpy of formation and standard entropy for HCl(aq). We also need the standard entropy for NiCl2(aq) and H2(g), and the standard entropy for Ni(s).\n\nPlease provide the missing values, and I will be able to calculate the change in enthalpy and entropy for the reaction."
