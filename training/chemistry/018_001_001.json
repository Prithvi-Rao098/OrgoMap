    "message_2": "To determine the rate law expression for the reaction between A and B, we need to analyze the effect of changing the concentrations of A and B on the reaction rate.\n\nGiven that doubling the concentration of A has no effect on the rate of the reaction, this means that the reaction is zero order with respect to A. Mathematically, this means that the exponent of A in the rate law expression is 0.\n\nGiven that doubling the concentration of B results in a fourfold increase in the rate, this means that the reaction is second order with respect to B. Mathematically, this means that the exponent of B in the rate law expression is 2.\n\nNow, we can write the rate law expression for the reaction:\n\nRate = k[A]^0[B]^2\n\nSince any value raised to the power of 0 is 1, the rate law expression simplifies to:\n\nRate = k[B]^2"
