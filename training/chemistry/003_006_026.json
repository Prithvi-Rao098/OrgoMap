Provide at least one example of a molecule and describe how its vibrational modes can be analyzed using both IR and Raman spectroscopy.",
    "message_2": "Infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopy are two complementary techniques used to study the vibrational modes of molecules. They both provide information about molecular vibrations, but they rely on different principles and probe different types of vibrational modes.\n\nThe fundamental difference between IR and Raman spectroscopy lies in the way they interact with molecules:\n\n1. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy: This technique is based on the absorption of infrared radiation by molecules. When a molecule absorbs IR radiation, it undergoes a transition from a lower to a higher vibrational energy level. IR spectroscopy is sensitive to changes in the dipole moment of a molecule during the vibration. Therefore, only those vibrations that result in a change in the molecular dipole moment can be observed in IR spectroscopy. These vibrations are called \"IR-active\" vibrations.\n\n2. Raman spectroscopy: This technique is based on the inelastic scattering of light by molecules, known as the Raman effect. When a molecule scatters light, it can undergo a transition between different vibrational energy levels. Raman spectroscopy is sensitive to changes in the polarizability of a molecule during the vibration. Therefore, only those vibrations that result in a change in the molecular polarizability can be observed in Raman spectroscopy. These vibrations are called \"Raman-active\" vibrations.\n\nUsing both IR and Raman spectroscopy together can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the vibrational modes of a molecule, as some modes may be active in one technique but not in the other. This is due to the selection rules for each technique, which dictate whether a particular vibrational mode will be observed.\n\nExample: Carbon dioxide (CO2) molecule\n\nCarbon dioxide is a linear molecule with three atoms and has four vibrational modes: two bending modes (degenerate) and two stretching modes (symmetric and asymmetric). \n\n1. In IR spectroscopy, the symmetric stretching mode does not result in a change in the dipole moment, so it is not IR-active. However, the asymmetric stretching mode and the bending modes do result in a change in the dipole moment, so they are IR-active.\n\n2. In Raman spectroscopy, the symmetric stretching mode results in a change in the polarizability of the molecule, so it is Raman-active. The asymmetric stretching mode does not result in a change in polarizability, so it is not Raman-active. The bending modes are also Raman-active.\n\nBy combining the information from both IR and Raman spectroscopy, we can identify all the vibrational modes of the CO2 molecule. The symmetric stretching mode is Raman-active, the asymmetric stretching mode is IR-active, and the bending modes are both IR and Raman-active."
