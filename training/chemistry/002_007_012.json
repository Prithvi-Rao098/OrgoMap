    "message_2": "The reaction between aluminum (Al) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) can be represented by the following balanced chemical equation:\n\n2Al (s) + 3H₂SO₄ (aq) → Al₂(SO₄)₃ (aq) + 3H₂ (g)\n\nIn this reaction, solid aluminum (Al) reacts with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) to form aqueous aluminum sulfate (Al₂(SO₄)₃) and hydrogen gas (H₂)."
