    "message_2": "To determine the enthalpy of hydrolysis for sodium acetate (NaC2H3O2), we need to consider the reactions involved in the process. The hydrolysis of sodium acetate can be represented by the following equation:\n\nNaC2H3O2 (aq) + H2O (l) → HC2H3O2 (aq) + NaOH (aq)\n\nThe enthalpy change for this reaction (ΔH_hydrolysis) can be calculated using Hess's Law, which states that the enthalpy change for a reaction is the same, whether it occurs in one step or several steps. We can use the given enthalpy values for the neutralization of acetic acid and sodium hydroxide and the heat of formation for sodium acetate to find the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis reaction.\n\nFirst, let's consider the neutralization reaction:\n\nHC2H3O2 (aq) + NaOH (aq) → NaC2H3O2 (aq) + H2O (l)      ΔH_neutralization = -55.9 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we need to reverse this reaction to get the formation reaction for sodium acetate:\n\nNaC2H3O2 (aq) + H2O (l) → HC2H3O2 (aq) + NaOH (aq)      ΔH_formation = -(-55.9 kJ/mol) = 55.9 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can use the heat of formation for sodium acetate (-382.7 kJ/mol) and the enthalpy change for the formation reaction (55.9 kJ/mol) to find the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis reaction:\n\nΔH_hydrolysis = ΔH_formation - ΔH_neutralization\n\nΔH_hydrolysis = (-382.7 kJ/mol) - (55.9 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH_hydrolysis = -438.6 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy of hydrolysis for sodium acetate (NaC2H3O2) is -438.6 kJ/mol."
