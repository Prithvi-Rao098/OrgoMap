    "message_2": "To calculate the lattice energy of CaO, we can use the Born-Lande equation:\n\nLattice Energy = - (Madelung constant * e^2) / (4 * π * ε0 * r0) * (1 - (1 / n))\n\nwhere:\n- Madelung constant = 1.74 (given)\n- e is the elementary charge = 1.602 x 10^-19 C\n- ε0 is the vacuum permittivity = 8.854 x 10^-12 C²/N·m²\n- r0 is the distance between the ions = 2.32 Å = 2.32 x 10^-10 m (converted from Å to m)\n- n is the Born exponent, which is typically between 5 and 12 for ionic compounds. For simplicity, we will use an average value of n = 9.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the equation:\n\nLattice Energy = - (1.74 * (1.602 x 10^-19 C)^2) / (4 * π * (8.854 x 10^-12 C²/N·m²) * (2.32 x 10^-10 m)) * (1 - (1 / 9))\n\nLattice Energy = - (1.74 * (2.566 x 10^-38 C²)) / (4 * π * (8.854 x 10^-12 C²/N·m²) * (2.32 x 10^-10 m)) * (1 - (1 / 9))\n\nLattice Energy = - (4.464 x 10^-38 C²) / (1.110 x 10^-21 N·m²) * (8 / 9)\n\nLattice Energy = - (4.018 x 10^17 N·m) * (8 / 9)\n\nLattice Energy = - (3.572 x 10^17 N·m)\n\nThe lattice energy of CaO is approximately -3.572 x 10^17 N·m."
