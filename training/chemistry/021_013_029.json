    "message_2": "The Lewis structure of the methane (CH4) molecule consists of a central carbon atom surrounded by four hydrogen atoms. Each hydrogen atom shares a single electron with the carbon atom, forming a single covalent bond. In total, there are four single covalent bonds formed between the carbon and hydrogen atoms in the methane molecule.\n\nThe Lewis structure can be represented as:\n\n       H\n       |\n    H--C--H\n       |\n       H"
