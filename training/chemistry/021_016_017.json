    "message_2": "The electronegativity difference in the molecule HCl is between a hydrogen atom and a chlorine atom, not a nitrogen atom. To calculate the electronegativity difference, we can use the Pauling scale values for hydrogen and chlorine.\n\nThe electronegativity value for hydrogen is 2.1, and for chlorine, it is 3.16. The electronegativity difference between hydrogen and chlorine in HCl is:\n\nElectronegativity difference = |Electronegativity of Chlorine - Electronegativity of Hydrogen|\n= |3.16 - 2.1|\n= 1.06"
