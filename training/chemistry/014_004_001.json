    "message_2": "In the complex [CoCl4]2-, there are four chloride ions (Cl-) surrounding the central cobalt (Co) atom, acting as ligands. According to the crystal field theory, the coordination number of a complex is determined by the number of ligand atoms directly bonded to the central metal atom. In this case, the coordination number of the complex [CoCl4]2- is 4.\n\nTo determine the oxidation state of cobalt in this complex, we can use the following formula:\n\nOxidation state of metal + (Charge of ligands × Number of ligands) = Charge of the complex\n\nLet the oxidation state of cobalt be x. The charge of each chloride ligand is -1, and there are four chloride ligands. The overall charge of the complex is -2. So, the equation becomes:\n\nx + (-1 × 4) = -2\nx - 4 = -2\nx = +2\n\nTherefore, the oxidation state of cobalt in the complex [CoCl4]2- is +2."
