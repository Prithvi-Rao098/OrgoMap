    "message_2": "To calculate the bond energy of the covalent bond between carbon and oxygen atoms in CO2, we need more information than just the bond length. Bond energy is the energy required to break a bond, and it depends on the type of bond and the specific molecule.\n\nHowever, we can provide an approximate value for the bond energy of a C=O double bond in CO2. The bond energy of a C=O double bond is approximately 745 kJ/mol. Keep in mind that this is an average value, and the actual bond energy may vary depending on the specific molecule and its environment."
