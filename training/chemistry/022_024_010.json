    "message_2": "To find the pH of the buffer solution, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log ([A-]/[HA])\n\nwhere pH is the pH of the solution, pKa is the acid dissociation constant, [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate ion), and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid (acetic acid).\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of acetic acid and sodium acetate:\n\nmoles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) = volume × concentration = 50 mL × 0.10 M = 5 mmol\nmoles of sodium acetate (CH3COONa) = volume × concentration = 25 mL × 0.10 M = 2.5 mmol\n\nNext, we need to find the total volume of the solution:\n\ntotal volume = volume of acetic acid + volume of sodium acetate = 50 mL + 25 mL = 75 mL\n\nNow, we can find the concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion in the solution:\n\n[CH3COOH] = moles of acetic acid / total volume = 5 mmol / 75 mL = 0.0667 M\n[CH3COO-] = moles of sodium acetate / total volume = 2.5 mmol / 75 mL = 0.0333 M\n\nNow, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH:\n\npH = pKa + log ([A-]/[HA]) = 4.76 + log (0.0333/0.0667) = 4.76 - 0.301 = 4.459\n\nThe pH of the buffer solution is approximately 4.46."
