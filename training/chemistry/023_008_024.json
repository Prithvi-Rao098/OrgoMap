    "message_2": "To determine the maximum yield of p-nitroaniline, we first need to find the stoichiometry of the reaction between aniline and nitric acid. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nC6H7N + HNO3 → C6H6N2O2 + H2O\n\nThis indicates that one mole of aniline reacts with one mole of nitric acid to produce one mole of p-nitroaniline.\n\nNext, we need to find the molar mass of aniline (C6H7N) and p-nitroaniline (C6H6N2O2):\n\nAniline: (6 * 12.01) + (7 * 1.01) + 14.01 = 93.13 g/mol\np-Nitroaniline: (6 * 12.01) + (6 * 1.01) + (2 * 14.01) + (2 * 16.00) = 138.12 g/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the moles of aniline in the 10 g sample:\n\nmoles of aniline = mass / molar mass = 10 g / 93.13 g/mol ≈ 0.107 moles\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, the maximum yield of p-nitroaniline is also 0.107 moles. To find the mass of this yield, we can use the molar mass of p-nitroaniline:\n\nmass of p-nitroaniline = moles * molar mass = 0.107 moles * 138.12 g/mol ≈ 14.79 g\n\nSo, the maximum yield of p-nitroaniline that can be obtained from 10 g of aniline is approximately 14.79 g.\n\nIf only 8 g of p-nitroaniline is actually obtained, we can calculate the percentage yield as follows:\n\npercentage yield = (actual yield / theoretical yield) * 100\npercentage yield = (8 g / 14.79 g) * 100 ≈ 54.09%\n\nTherefore, the percentage yield obtained if only 8 g of p-nitroaniline is actually obtained is approximately 54.09%."
