    "message_2": "The order of a reaction can be determined by analyzing how the rate of the reaction changes with the concentration of the reactants. In this case, the rate constant (k) changes by a factor of 100 when the concentration of the reactant is increased by 10 times.\n\nLet's denote the initial concentration of the reactant as [A] and the initial rate constant as k1. When the concentration of the reactant is increased by 10 times, the new concentration is 10[A] and the new rate constant is k2 = 100k1.\n\nThe rate law for a reaction can be written as:\n\nRate = k[A]^n\n\nwhere n is the order of the reaction with respect to the reactant A.\n\nFor the initial concentration and rate constant, we have:\n\nRate1 = k1[A]^n\n\nFor the increased concentration and rate constant, we have:\n\nRate2 = k2(10[A])^n = 100k1(10[A])^n\n\nNow, we can set up a ratio of the two rates:\n\nRate2/Rate1 = (100k1(10[A])^n) / (k1[A]^n)\n\nSince Rate2 is 100 times Rate1, we have:\n\n100 = (100k1(10[A])^n) / (k1[A]^n)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n1 = (10^n)\n\nTo find the order of the reaction (n), we can take the logarithm of both sides:\n\nlog(1) = log(10^n)\n\n0 = n * log(10)\n\nSince log(10) = 1, we get:\n\n0 = n\n\nSo, the order of the reaction is 0. However, this result is contradictory to the given information that the rate constant changes by a factor of 100 when the concentration of the reactant is increased by 10 times. It seems there might be an error or misunderstanding in the problem statement. Please double-check the information provided and ensure it is accurate."
