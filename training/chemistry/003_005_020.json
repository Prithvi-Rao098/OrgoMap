    "message_2": "To calculate the bond order of the nitrogen molecule (N2) using molecular orbital theory, we need to determine the number of electrons in bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals.\n\nNitrogen has 7 electrons in its valence shell, and since there are two nitrogen atoms in N2, there are a total of 14 valence electrons.\n\nAccording to molecular orbital theory, the order of filling molecular orbitals for diatomic molecules is as follows:\n\n1. σ1s\n2. σ*1s\n3. σ2s\n4. σ*2s\n5. π2p_x and π2p_y (degenerate orbitals)\n6. π*2p_x and π*2p_y (degenerate orbitals)\n7. σ2p_z\n8. σ*2p_z\n\nNow, let's fill the molecular orbitals with the 14 valence electrons:\n\n1. σ1s: 2 electrons\n2. σ*1s: 2 electrons\n3. σ2s: 2 electrons\n4. σ*2s: 2 electrons\n5. π2p_x and π2p_y: 4 electrons (2 in each)\n6. π*2p_x and π*2p_y: 0 electrons\n7. σ2p_z: 2 electrons\n8. σ*2p_z: 0 electrons\n\nNow, we can calculate the bond order using the formula:\n\nBond order = (number of electrons in bonding orbitals - number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\n\nBond order = (10 - 4) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3\n\nSo, the bond order of the nitrogen molecule (N2) is 3, which indicates a strong triple bond between the two nitrogen atoms."
