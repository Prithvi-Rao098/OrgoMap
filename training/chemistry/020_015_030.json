    "message_1": "What would be the effect on the degree of ionization of a weak acid like acetic acid in a solution containing it along with 1 M of hydrochloric acid?",
    "message_2": "In a solution containing a weak acid like acetic acid (CH3COOH) along with a strong acid like hydrochloric acid (HCl), the degree of ionization of the weak acid will be significantly reduced.\n\nThis is because HCl is a strong acid and will ionize completely in the solution, releasing a large amount of H+ ions. The presence of these H+ ions will suppress the ionization of the weak acid, acetic acid, due to the common ion effect. The common ion effect states that the ionization of a weak electrolyte is suppressed in the presence of a strong electrolyte containing a common ion.\n\nIn this case, the common ion is the H+ ion. Since the concentration of H+ ions is already high due to the presence of HCl, the equilibrium of the ionization of acetic acid will shift to the left, according to Le Chatelier's principle:\n\nCH3COOH â‡Œ CH3COO- + H+\n\nAs a result, the degree of ionization of acetic acid will be reduced, and the solution will have a lower concentration of acetate ions (CH3COO-) than if the acetic acid were present alone."
