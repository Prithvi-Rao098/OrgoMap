    "message_2": "Predicting the absorption spectra of a molecule using quantum chemical calculations of excited states involves several steps. These calculations are typically performed using specialized computational chemistry software packages. Here's an outline of the process:\n\n1. Choose an appropriate quantum chemical method: Select a suitable quantum chemical method to calculate the excited states of the molecule. Common methods include time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT), configuration interaction singles (CIS), and equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (EOM-CC). The choice of method depends on the size of the molecule, the desired accuracy, and the available computational resources.\n\n2. Build the molecular model: Construct a 3D model of the molecule using a molecular editor or by importing a structure from a database. Ensure that the structure is optimized, meaning that the geometry corresponds to a minimum on the potential energy surface.\n\n3. Select a basis set: Choose an appropriate basis set for the calculations. A basis set is a mathematical representation of the atomic orbitals used in the calculations. Common basis sets include Pople-style basis sets (e.g., 6-31G), correlation-consistent basis sets (e.g., cc-pVDZ), and atomic natural orbital basis sets (e.g., ANO-L). The choice of basis set depends on the desired accuracy and computational cost.\n\n4. Perform the excited state calculations: Using the chosen quantum chemical method, basis set, and molecular model, perform the calculations to obtain the excitation energies and oscillator strengths of the molecule. The excitation energies correspond to the energy differences between the ground state and the excited states, while the oscillator strengths are a measure of the probability of a transition between the ground state and the excited states.\n\n5. Analyze the results: The calculated excitation energies and oscillator strengths can be used to predict the absorption spectra of the molecule. The excitation energies can be converted to wavelengths (λ) using the relationship λ = hc/E, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and E is the excitation energy. The oscillator strengths can be used to determine the intensities of the absorption bands. Plot the wavelengths and intensities to obtain the predicted absorption spectra.\n\n6. Compare with experimental data: If available, compare the predicted absorption spectra with experimental data to assess the accuracy of the calculations. If necessary, refine the quantum chemical method, basis set, or molecular model to improve the agreement between the predicted and experimental spectra.\n\nBy following these steps, you can predict the absorption spectra of a molecule using quantum chemical calculations of excited states. Keep in mind that the accuracy of the predictions depends on the chosen method, basis set, and molecular model, as well as the quality of the experimental data for comparison."
