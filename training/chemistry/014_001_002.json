    "message_2": "The coordination compound [Co(en)2(H2O)2]Cl3 contains a cobalt(III) ion (Co3+) as the central metal ion, two ethylenediamine (en) ligands, and two water (H2O) ligands. The chemical composition of the complex can be written as Co(C2H8N2)2(H2O)2Cl3.\n\nEthylenediamine (en) is a bidentate ligand, meaning it can form two coordinate covalent bonds with the central metal ion. In this complex, there are two en ligands, so they form a total of four coordinate covalent bonds with the cobalt(III) ion. The two water molecules are monodentate ligands, each forming one coordinate covalent bond with the cobalt(III) ion. In total, there are six coordinate covalent bonds formed between the ligands and the central metal ion.\n\nThe coordination geometry of this complex is octahedral. In an octahedral geometry, the central metal ion is surrounded by six ligands, with each ligand occupying a vertex of an octahedron. The bond angles between the ligands are 90 degrees.\n\nThe bonding in this coordination compound involves the donation of electron pairs from the ligands to the empty orbitals of the central metal ion. In the case of ethylenediamine, the nitrogen atoms donate their lone pair of electrons to form coordinate covalent bonds with the cobalt(III) ion. Similarly, the oxygen atoms of the water molecules donate their lone pairs to form coordinate covalent bonds with the cobalt(III) ion. This type of bonding is known as coordinate or dative bonding, and it results in the formation of a stable coordination complex."
