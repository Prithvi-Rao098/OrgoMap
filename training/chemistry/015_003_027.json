Given the following bond lengths and force constants:\n- Bond length of the CO bond in the ground state: 1.128 angstroms\n- Force constant of the CO bond in the ground state: 1880 N/m",
    "message_2": "To calculate the molecular vibrational frequencies of a carbon monoxide (CO) molecule using the harmonic oscillator model, we can use the following formula:\n\nv = (1 / 2π) * √(k / μ)\n\nwhere v is the vibrational frequency, k is the force constant, and μ is the reduced mass of the CO molecule.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the reduced mass (μ) of the CO molecule. The reduced mass can be calculated using the formula:\n\nμ = (m1 * m2) / (m1 + m2)\n\nwhere m1 and m2 are the masses of the carbon and oxygen atoms, respectively. The atomic masses of carbon and oxygen are approximately 12 amu and 16 amu, respectively. To convert these atomic masses to kilograms, we can use the conversion factor:\n\n1 amu = 1.66054 × 10^(-27) kg\n\nSo, the masses of carbon and oxygen in kilograms are:\n\nm1 = 12 amu * 1.66054 × 10^(-27) kg/amu = 1.99265 × 10^(-26) kg\nm2 = 16 amu * 1.66054 × 10^(-27) kg/amu = 2.65672 × 10^(-26) kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the reduced mass (μ):\n\nμ = (1.99265 × 10^(-26) kg * 2.65672 × 10^(-26) kg) / (1.99265 × 10^(-26) kg + 2.65672 × 10^(-26) kg)\nμ = 1.13867 × 10^(-26) kg\n\nNow that we have the reduced mass, we can calculate the vibrational frequency (v) using the given force constant (k = 1880 N/m):\n\nv = (1 / 2π) * √(1880 N/m / 1.13867 × 10^(-26) kg)\nv = (1 / 2π) * √(1.65125 × 10^(14) s^(-2))\nv = 2.036 × 10^13 Hz\n\nThe molecular vibrational frequency of the carbon monoxide (CO) molecule is approximately 2.036 × 10^13 Hz.\n\nTo determine the corresponding infrared spectra, we can convert the frequency to wavenumber (ν̃) using the speed of light (c):\n\nν̃ = v / c\n\nwhere c is the speed of light (approximately 3 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nν̃ = (2.036 × 10^13 Hz) / (3 × 10^8 m/s)\nν̃ = 6.787 × 10^4 m^(-1)\n\nThe corresponding infrared spectra of the carbon monoxide (CO) molecule is approximately 6.787 × 10^4 m^(-1) or 6787 cm^(-1)."
