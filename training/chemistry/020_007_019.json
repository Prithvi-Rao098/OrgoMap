    "message_2": "When the pressure of a system at constant temperature is increased, the equilibrium composition will shift in the direction that reduces the pressure. This is in accordance with Le Chatelier's principle, which states that when a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in pressure, temperature, or concentration of reactants and products, the system will adjust its equilibrium position to counteract the change.\n\nA specific example of a chemical equation to illustrate this concept is the Haber process for the synthesis of ammonia:\n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) â‡Œ 2NH3(g)\n\nIn this reaction, 1 mole of nitrogen gas reacts with 3 moles of hydrogen gas to produce 2 moles of ammonia gas. When the pressure of the system is increased, the equilibrium will shift in the direction that reduces the number of moles of gas, which in this case is the formation of ammonia (the right side of the equation). This is because there are 4 moles of gas on the left side (1 mole of N2 and 3 moles of H2) and only 2 moles of gas on the right side (2 moles of NH3).\n\nAs a result, when the pressure is increased, the equilibrium composition will shift to the right, favoring the formation of ammonia. This will lead to an increase in the concentration of ammonia and a decrease in the concentrations of nitrogen and hydrogen gases."
