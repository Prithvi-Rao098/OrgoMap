    "message_2": "To determine the rate law expression for the given reaction, we need to consider the effect of the concentration changes on the reaction rate.\n\nThe reaction rate doubles when the concentration of NO doubles, which indicates that the reaction is first-order with respect to NO. Mathematically, this means that the exponent of the concentration of NO in the rate law expression is 1.\n\nThe reaction rate remains unchanged when the concentration of O2 doubles, which indicates that the reaction is zero-order with respect to O2. Mathematically, this means that the exponent of the concentration of O2 in the rate law expression is 0.\n\nNow, we can write the rate law expression:\n\nRate = k[NO]^1[O2]^0\n\nSince any number raised to the power of 0 is 1, the rate law expression simplifies to:\n\nRate = k[NO]"
