    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of ionization of hydrogen gas (H₂), we need to consider the process of ionization. In this case, one mole of hydrogen gas (H₂) dissociates into two moles of hydrogen atoms (H) and then ionizes to form two moles of hydrogen ions (H⁺) and two moles of electrons (e⁻).\n\nThe overall process can be represented as:\n\nH₂(g) → 2H(g) → 2H⁺(g) + 2e⁻\n\nFirst, we need to consider the bond dissociation energy of H₂, which is the energy required to break one mole of H-H bonds in the gas phase. The bond dissociation energy of H₂ is approximately 436 kJ/mol.\n\nH₂(g) → 2H(g) ; ΔH = +436 kJ/mol\n\nNext, we need to consider the ionization energy of hydrogen atoms. The problem states that it requires 1312 kJ/mol to ionize a single hydrogen atom (H) in the gas phase.\n\nH(g) → H⁺(g) + e⁻ ; ΔH = +1312 kJ/mol\n\nSince there are two moles of hydrogen atoms (H) in one mole of hydrogen gas (H₂), we need to multiply the ionization energy by 2.\n\n2H(g) → 2H⁺(g) + 2e⁻ ; ΔH = 2 × 1312 kJ/mol = +2624 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the overall enthalpy of ionization of hydrogen gas (H₂) by adding the enthalpies of the two processes:\n\nΔH_total = ΔH_dissociation + ΔH_ionization\nΔH_total = 436 kJ/mol + 2624 kJ/mol\nΔH_total = 3060 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy of ionization of hydrogen gas (H₂) is 3060 kJ/mol."
