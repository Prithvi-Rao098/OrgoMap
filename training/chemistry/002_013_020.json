    "message_2": "In SF6 (sulfur hexafluoride) molecule, the central atom is sulfur. To determine the hybridization of the central atom, we need to consider the number of electron domains around the central atom. Electron domains include bonding pairs and lone pairs of electrons.\n\nSulfur has 6 valence electrons, and each fluorine atom contributes 1 electron for bonding. So, there are a total of 6 bonding pairs of electrons around the sulfur atom. There are no lone pairs on the sulfur atom in SF6.\n\nThe total number of electron domains is 6 (all are bonding pairs). To accommodate these 6 electron domains, the sulfur atom needs to use its 3s, 3px, 3py, 3pz, 3dx²-y², and 3dxy orbitals for hybridization. This results in sp³d² hybridization.\n\nSo, the hybridization of the central atom (sulfur) in the SF6 molecule is sp³d²."
