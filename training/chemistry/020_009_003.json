    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kp) for the reaction between nitrogen gas (N₂) and hydrogen gas (H₂) to form ammonia gas (NH₃), we can use the following equation:\n\nN₂(g) + 3H₂(g) ⇌ 2NH₃(g)\n\nThe equilibrium constant expression for this reaction is:\n\nKp = (P_NH3)^2 / (P_N2 * (P_H2)^3)\n\nwhere P_NH3, P_N2, and P_H2 are the partial pressures of ammonia, nitrogen, and hydrogen gases, respectively, at equilibrium.\n\nGiven the partial pressures of the gases at equilibrium:\n\nP_N2 = 0.8 atm\nP_H2 = 0.6 atm\nP_NH3 = 1.7 atm\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Kp expression:\n\nKp = (1.7)^2 / (0.8 * (0.6)^3)\nKp = 2.89 / (0.8 * 0.216)\nKp = 2.89 / 0.1728\nKp ≈ 16.73\n\nThe equilibrium constant (Kp) for the reaction between nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas to form ammonia gas at 25°C is approximately 16.73."
