    "message_2": "The chemical equation for the gas evolution reaction that occurs when magnesium metal reacts with hydrochloric acid is:\n\nMg (s) + 2 HCl (aq) â†’ MgCl2 (aq) + H2 (g)\n\nIn this reaction, magnesium (Mg) reacts with hydrochloric acid (HCl) to produce magnesium chloride (MgCl2) and hydrogen gas (H2). This reaction demonstrates the relationship between acid strength and reactivity with metals because the stronger the acid, the more reactive it is with metals. Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid, and it readily reacts with magnesium to produce a significant amount of hydrogen gas. If a weaker acid were used, the reaction would be slower and produce less hydrogen gas."
