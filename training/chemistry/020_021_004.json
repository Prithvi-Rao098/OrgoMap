    "message_2": "The equilibrium constant expression for the redox reaction is given by:\n\nK = [Fe³⁺][Cu²⁺] / [Fe²⁺]\n\nAt equilibrium, the concentration of Fe²⁺ is 0.03 M. We can determine the change in concentration for the other species involved in the reaction.\n\nInitial concentrations:\n[Fe²⁺] = 0.10 M\n[Cu²⁺] = 0.15 M\n[Fe³⁺] = 0.05 M\n\nAt equilibrium:\n[Fe²⁺] = 0.03 M\n\nChange in concentration:\nΔ[Fe²⁺] = -0.07 M (since it decreased from 0.10 M to 0.03 M)\nΔ[Fe³⁺] = +0.07 M (since it increased by the same amount as Fe²⁺ decreased)\nΔ[Cu²⁺] = +0.07 M (since it increased by the same amount as Fe²⁺ decreased)\n\nEquilibrium concentrations:\n[Fe²⁺] = 0.03 M\n[Cu²⁺] = 0.15 M + 0.07 M = 0.22 M\n[Fe³⁺] = 0.05 M + 0.07 M = 0.12 M\n\nNow we can plug these equilibrium concentrations into the equilibrium constant expression:\n\nK = [Fe³⁺][Cu²⁺] / [Fe²⁺]\nK = (0.12 M)(0.22 M) / (0.03 M)\nK ≈ 0.88"
