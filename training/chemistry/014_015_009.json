    "message_2": "The coordination geometry of the metal ion in the active site of the metalloenzyme carbonic anhydrase is a distorted tetrahedral geometry. The metal ion is usually a zinc ion (Zn2+), which is coordinated to three histidine residues from the protein and a hydroxide ion or water molecule as the fourth ligand.\n\nThe active site of carbonic anhydrase facilitates the enzymatic reaction of converting carbon dioxide (CO2) to bicarbonate ion (HCO3-) through a two-step process:\n\n1. Activation of water molecule: The zinc ion polarizes the water molecule (or hydroxide ion) in the active site, making it more nucleophilic. This is achieved by the positively charged Zn2+ ion attracting the electron density of the water molecule's oxygen atom, which weakens the O-H bond and increases the nucleophilicity of the oxygen.\n\n2. Nucleophilic attack on CO2: The activated water molecule (or hydroxide ion) performs a nucleophilic attack on the carbon atom of CO2, which is electrophilic due to its partial positive charge. This results in the formation of a bicarbonate ion (HCO3-) and a proton (H+).\n\nThe distorted tetrahedral geometry of the zinc ion in the active site allows for optimal orientation and interaction between the metal ion, the water molecule (or hydroxide ion), and the CO2 molecule. This arrangement ensures efficient catalysis of the reaction, making carbonic anhydrase one of the fastest enzymes known, with a turnover rate of up to 10^6 reactions per second."
