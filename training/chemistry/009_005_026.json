(Given that the atomic mass of oxygen-16 is 15.99491 u and the proton and neutron mass are approximately 1.00728 u and 1.00867 u respectively. Use the Einstein's famous equation E=mc² where c is the speed of light and m is the mass defect of the nucleus.)",
    "message_2": "To find the nuclear binding energy of an oxygen-16 nucleus, we first need to calculate the mass defect. Oxygen-16 has 8 protons and 8 neutrons.\n\nMass of 8 protons = 8 * 1.00728 u = 8.05824 u\nMass of 8 neutrons = 8 * 1.00867 u = 8.06936 u\nTotal mass of protons and neutrons = 8.05824 u + 8.06936 u = 16.1276 u\n\nMass defect = Total mass of protons and neutrons - Atomic mass of oxygen-16\nMass defect = 16.1276 u - 15.99491 u = 0.13269 u\n\nNow, we need to convert the mass defect from atomic mass units (u) to kilograms (kg). 1 u = 1.66054 x 10^(-27) kg.\n\nMass defect in kg = 0.13269 u * 1.66054 x 10^(-27) kg/u = 2.20302 x 10^(-28) kg\n\nNow, we can use Einstein's equation E=mc² to find the nuclear binding energy. The speed of light (c) is approximately 3.00 x 10^8 m/s.\n\nE = (2.20302 x 10^(-28) kg) * (3.00 x 10^8 m/s)²\nE = 2.20302 x 10^(-28) kg * 9.00 x 10^16 m²/s²\nE = 1.98272 x 10^(-11) J\n\nThe nuclear binding energy of an oxygen-16 nucleus is approximately 1.98272 x 10^(-11) Joules."
