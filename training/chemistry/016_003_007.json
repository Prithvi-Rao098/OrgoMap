    "message_1": "A certain hydrocarbon requires 343 kJ of energy to break one mole of carbon-carbon bonds and 413 kJ/mole to break one mole of carbon-hydrogen bonds. What is the bond dissociation energy of the carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen bonds in this hydrocarbon?",
    "message_2": "The bond dissociation energy is the energy required to break a specific type of bond in a molecule. In this case, the bond dissociation energy for the carbon-carbon (C-C) bond is 343 kJ/mole, and the bond dissociation energy for the carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond is 413 kJ/mole. These values are already given in the problem statement, so there is no further calculation needed."
