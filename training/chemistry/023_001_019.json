    "message_2": "To determine the maximum amount of aspirin that can be synthesized, we need to first find the limiting reactant and then calculate the theoretical yield. Finally, we will account for the 90% yield.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the synthesis of aspirin is:\n\nC7H6O3 (salicylic acid) + C4H6O3 (acetic anhydride) â†’ C9H8O4 (aspirin) + C2H4O2 (acetic acid)\n\nMolar masses:\nSalicylic acid (C7H6O3): 138.12 g/mol\nAcetic anhydride (C4H6O3): 102.09 g/mol\nAspirin (C9H8O4): 180.16 g/mol\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given amounts of reactants to moles:\n\n5 g salicylic acid * (1 mol / 138.12 g) = 0.0362 mol salicylic acid\n\nThe density of acetic anhydride is approximately 1.08 g/mL, so 10 mL weighs:\n\n10 mL * 1.08 g/mL = 10.8 g acetic anhydride\n\n10.8 g acetic anhydride * (1 mol / 102.09 g) = 0.1058 mol acetic anhydride\n\nNow, we need to determine the limiting reactant by comparing the mole ratio:\n\n0.0362 mol salicylic acid / 1 = 0.0362\n0.1058 mol acetic anhydride / 1 = 0.1058\n\nSince 0.0362 < 0.1058, salicylic acid is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow, we can calculate the theoretical yield of aspirin:\n\n0.0362 mol salicylic acid * (1 mol aspirin / 1 mol salicylic acid) * (180.16 g aspirin / 1 mol aspirin) = 6.52 g aspirin (theoretical yield)\n\nFinally, we account for the 90% yield:\n\n6.52 g aspirin * 0.90 = 5.87 g aspirin (maximum amount that can be synthesized)"
