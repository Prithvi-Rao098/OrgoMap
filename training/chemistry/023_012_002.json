    "message_2": "To determine the optimal ratio of toluene to nitric acid for synthesizing 100 grams of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) with a 95% yield, we first need to consider the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nC7H8 (toluene) + 3 HNO3 (nitric acid) → C7H5N3O6 (TNT) + 3 H2O (water)\n\nNext, we need to calculate the theoretical amount of toluene and nitric acid required to produce 100 grams of TNT with a 95% yield.\n\n1. Calculate the molar mass of TNT:\nC7H5N3O6: (7 × 12.01) + (5 × 1.01) + (3 × 14.01) + (6 × 16.00) = 227.13 g/mol\n\n2. Calculate the moles of TNT required for 100 grams with a 95% yield:\n100 g / 227.13 g/mol = 0.4403 mol\n0.4403 mol / 0.95 = 0.4635 mol (to account for the 95% yield)\n\n3. Calculate the moles of toluene and nitric acid required:\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:3, we need 0.4635 mol of toluene and 3 × 0.4635 mol = 1.3905 mol of nitric acid.\n\n4. Calculate the mass of toluene and nitric acid required:\nToluene: 0.4635 mol × (12.01 × 7 + 1.01 × 8) g/mol = 46.35 g\nNitric acid: 1.3905 mol × (1.01 × 1 + 14.01 × 1 + 16.00 × 3) g/mol = 97.05 g\n\n5. Determine the optimal ratio of toluene to nitric acid:\n46.35 g toluene / 97.05 g nitric acid ≈ 1:2.1 (by mass)\n\nTherefore, the optimal ratio of toluene to nitric acid required to synthesize 100 grams of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene with a 95% yield, given the reaction constraints, is approximately 1:2.1 by mass."
