    "message_2": "Ubiquitination is a post-translational modification process that plays a crucial role in the degradation and turnover of specific proteins within a cellular context. This process involves the covalent attachment of a small protein called ubiquitin to the target protein, marking it for degradation by the proteasome, a large protein complex responsible for breaking down and recycling proteins in the cell.\n\nThe ubiquitination process consists of three main enzymatic steps:\n\n1. Activation: The first step involves the activation of ubiquitin by an enzyme called ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1). This activation occurs through the formation of a high-energy thioester bond between the C-terminus of ubiquitin and a cysteine residue in the E1 enzyme. This reaction requires ATP as an energy source.\n\n2. Conjugation: The activated ubiquitin is then transferred to a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). This transfer occurs through the formation of a thioester bond between the C-terminus of ubiquitin and a cysteine residue in the E2 enzyme.\n\n3. Ligation: Finally, a ubiquitin ligase enzyme (E3) recognizes the target protein and facilitates the transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 enzyme to a lysine residue on the target protein. This transfer results in the formation of an isopeptide bond between the C-terminus of ubiquitin and the Îµ-amino group of the lysine residue on the target protein. This process can be repeated, leading to the formation of a polyubiquitin chain on the target protein.\n\nThe polyubiquitinated protein is then recognized by the 26S proteasome, a large protein complex responsible for degrading and recycling proteins in the cell. The proteasome unfolds the target protein and cleaves it into small peptides, which are further degraded into amino acids that can be reused by the cell for the synthesis of new proteins.\n\nIn summary, ubiquitination is a critical process that aids in the degradation and turnover of specific proteins in a cellular context. By attaching ubiquitin molecules to target proteins, the cell can efficiently regulate protein levels, maintain protein homeostasis, and ensure proper cellular function."
