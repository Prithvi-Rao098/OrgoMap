    "message_2": "The predicted bond angle for the H2O (water) molecule is approximately 104.5 degrees. This angle is determined by the molecular geometry of the water molecule, which is bent or V-shaped.\n\nThere are several factors that affect this bond angle:\n\n1. Electron repulsion: The water molecule has two bonding pairs (the O-H bonds) and two non-bonding pairs (lone pairs) of electrons on the oxygen atom. According to the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory, electron pairs repel each other and arrange themselves to minimize repulsion. Lone pairs repel more strongly than bonding pairs, causing the bonding pairs to be pushed closer together, resulting in a bond angle smaller than the ideal tetrahedral angle of 109.5 degrees.\n\n2. Electronegativity: Oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen, meaning it attracts electrons more strongly. This causes the electron density in the O-H bonds to be pulled towards the oxygen atom, further influencing the bond angle.\n\n3. Hybridization: In water, the oxygen atom is sp3 hybridized, meaning it has four orbitals (one s and three p orbitals) that combine to form four sp3 hybrid orbitals. These orbitals arrange themselves in a tetrahedral geometry, but due to the presence of lone pairs, the actual bond angle deviates from the ideal tetrahedral angle."
