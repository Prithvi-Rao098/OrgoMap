    "message_2": "To determine how a decrease in temperature affects the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g), we need to consider the reaction's enthalpy change (ΔH). The formation of ammonia (NH3) from nitrogen (N2) and hydrogen (H2) is an exothermic reaction, meaning it releases heat (ΔH < 0).\n\nAccording to Le Chatelier's principle, if a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in temperature, the system will adjust itself to counteract the change. In this case, since the reaction is exothermic, a decrease in temperature will shift the equilibrium to the right (toward the formation of NH3) to produce more heat. As a result, the equilibrium constant (Kc) will increase.\n\nTo calculate the new equilibrium constant at 250°C, we can use the van't Hoff equation:\n\nln(Kc2/Kc1) = -ΔH/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere Kc1 and Kc2 are the equilibrium constants at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively, ΔH is the enthalpy change of the reaction, and R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K).\n\nHowever, we do not have the value of ΔH for this reaction. Without this information, we cannot directly calculate the new equilibrium constant at 250°C. But we can qualitatively say that the new Kc will be greater than the initial Kc (4.34 x 10^-3) due to the decrease in temperature for this exothermic reaction."
