    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use Hess's Law, which states that the total enthalpy change for a reaction is the sum of the enthalpy changes for the individual steps. In this case, we can use the enthalpy changes of formation (∆Hf°) for the reactants and products.\n\nThe equation for calculating the standard enthalpy change for the reaction is:\n\n∆H° = Σ [∆Hf°(products)] - Σ [∆Hf°(reactants)]\n\nFor this reaction, the products are NaCl(aq) and H2O(l), and the reactants are NaOH(aq) and HCl(aq). Plugging in the given values, we get:\n\n∆H° = [(-407.3 kJ/mol) + (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [(-469.11 kJ/mol) + (-167.16 kJ/mol)]\n\n∆H° = (-407.3 - 285.8 + 469.11 + 167.16) kJ/mol\n\n∆H° = (-693.1 + 636.27) kJ/mol\n\n∆H° = -56.83 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the reaction is -56.83 kJ/mol."
