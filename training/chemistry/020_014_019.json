    "message_2": "To determine the new ionization constant (Ka) of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid when the temperature is increased from 25°C to 35°C, we need to use the Van't Hoff equation:\n\nln(Ka2/Ka1) = -ΔH°/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nWhere:\n- Ka1 is the initial ionization constant (1.8 x 10^-5)\n- Ka2 is the new ionization constant at 35°C (which we want to find)\n- ΔH° is the standard enthalpy change of the reaction (for acetic acid, it is approximately -55 kJ/mol)\n- R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\n- T1 is the initial temperature in Kelvin (25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K)\n- T2 is the final temperature in Kelvin (35°C + 273.15 = 308.15 K)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the standard enthalpy change from kJ/mol to J/mol:\n\nΔH° = -55 kJ/mol * (1000 J/1 kJ) = -55000 J/mol\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Van't Hoff equation:\n\nln(Ka2/(1.8 x 10^-5)) = -(-55000 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K) * (1/308.15 K - 1/298.15 K)\n\nSolve for Ka2:\n\nln(Ka2/(1.8 x 10^-5)) ≈ 0.0126\nKa2/(1.8 x 10^-5) ≈ 1.0127\nKa2 ≈ 1.8 x 10^-5 * 1.0127\nKa2 ≈ 1.82 x 10^-5\n\nSo, the new ionization constant of the 0.1 M solution of acetic acid at 35°C is approximately 1.82 x 10^-5."
