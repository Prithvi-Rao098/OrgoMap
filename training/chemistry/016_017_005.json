    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the oxidation of methane, we need to use the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) for each substance involved in the reaction. The standard enthalpies of formation are given in kJ/mol.\n\nΔHf° (CH4) = -74.8 kJ/mol\nΔHf° (CO2) = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔHf° (H2O) = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change for the reaction can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nΔH = Σ [ΔHf° (products)] - Σ [ΔHf° (reactants)]\n\nΔH = [1 × (-393.5) + 2 × (-285.8)] - [1 × (-74.8) + 2 × 0]\n\nNote that the ΔHf° for O2 is zero because it is in its standard state as an element.\n\nΔH = (-393.5 - 571.6) - (-74.8)\n\nΔH = -965.1 + 74.8\n\nΔH = -890.3 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the oxidation of methane to form carbon dioxide and water is -890.3 kJ/mol."
