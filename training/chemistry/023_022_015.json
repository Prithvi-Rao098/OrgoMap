    "message_2": "The preparation of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid from benzoic acid and nitric acid involves nitration, which is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nC₆H₅COOH + 2 HNO₃ → C₆H₃(NO₂)₂COOH + 2 H₂O\n\nBenzoic acid (C₆H₅COOH) reacts with two moles of nitric acid (HNO₃) to form 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid (C₆H₃(NO₂)₂COOH) and two moles of water (H₂O) as a byproduct."
