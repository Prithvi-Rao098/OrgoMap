    "message_2": "To calculate the bond energy required to break the bond between two nitrogen atoms (N2), we need to know the bond dissociation energy (BDE) for the N-N triple bond. The bond length alone is not sufficient to determine the bond energy.\n\nThe bond dissociation energy for the N-N triple bond in N2 is approximately 941 kJ/mol. This is the energy required to break the bond between two nitrogen atoms in a mole of N2 molecules."
