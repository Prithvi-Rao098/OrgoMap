    "message_2": "The maximum dose of Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) that can be safely administered to a patient during a medical diagnostic imaging procedure depends on the specific procedure being performed and the patient's individual characteristics. Generally, the administered activity of Tc-99m ranges from 1 to 30 millicuries (mCi) or 37 to 1,110 megabecquerels (MBq) for most diagnostic procedures. However, it is essential to use the lowest possible dose that still provides adequate diagnostic information.\n\nFactors that influence the safe dosage of Tc-99m include:\n\n1. Patient's age: Younger patients are more radiosensitive, so lower doses should be used for them.\n2. Patient's weight: Heavier patients may require higher doses to achieve adequate imaging quality.\n3. Patient's medical condition: Patients with compromised renal or hepatic function may require dose adjustments.\n4. Type of diagnostic procedure: Different procedures require different amounts of Tc-99m, depending on the target organ and the desired image quality.\n5. Radiopharmaceutical formulation: The specific Tc-99m compound used (e.g., Tc-99m MDP for bone scans or Tc-99m MAG3 for renal scans) may influence the optimal dose.\n\nTo calculate the effective dose of Tc-99m for a given patient based on the administered activity, one can use the following formula:\n\nEffective dose (mSv) = Administered activity (MBq) × Tissue weighting factor (wT) × Organ dose coefficient (mSv/MBq)\n\nThe tissue weighting factor (wT) represents the relative radiosensitivity of different organs, and the organ dose coefficient is a measure of the absorbed dose per unit of administered activity. These values can be found in the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) publications and may vary depending on the specific radiopharmaceutical used.\n\nIn practice, the calculation of the effective dose is often performed using specialized software or online tools that take into account the patient's characteristics, the administered activity, and the specific radiopharmaceutical used. This allows for a more accurate estimation of the radiation risk associated with the diagnostic procedure."
