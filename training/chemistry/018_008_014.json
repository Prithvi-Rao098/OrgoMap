    "message_2": "According to Le Chatelier's principle, if a change in conditions (such as pressure) is applied to a system at equilibrium, the system will adjust itself to counteract the change and restore a new equilibrium.\n\nThe balanced equation for the synthesis of ammonia is:\n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) â‡Œ 2NH3(g)\n\nIn this reaction, there are 4 moles of gas on the reactant side (1 mole of N2 and 3 moles of H2) and 2 moles of gas on the product side (2 moles of NH3).\n\nWhen the pressure of the reaction system is increased, the system will try to counteract the change by shifting the equilibrium to the side with fewer moles of gas, which in this case is the product side (formation of ammonia). This shift will result in an increased rate of the forward reaction, leading to the formation of more ammonia.\n\nConversely, if the pressure of the reaction system is decreased, the system will shift the equilibrium to the side with more moles of gas (the reactant side) to counteract the change. This will result in an increased rate of the reverse reaction, leading to the decomposition of ammonia back into nitrogen and hydrogen gas.\n\nIn summary, increasing the pressure of the reaction system will increase the rate of ammonia formation, while decreasing the pressure will decrease the rate of ammonia formation, according to Le Chatelier's principle."
