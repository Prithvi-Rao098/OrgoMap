    "message_2": "The structure of DNA plays a crucial role in its function of storing genetic information. DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a long, double-stranded molecule composed of nucleotides, which are the building blocks of DNA. Each nucleotide consists of a sugar molecule (deoxyribose), a phosphate group, and one of four nitrogenous bases: adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C). The DNA molecule is arranged in a double helix structure, with the sugar and phosphate groups forming the backbone of the helix, and the nitrogenous bases forming the rungs of the ladder.\n\nThere are several aspects of DNA's structure that contribute to its function in storing genetic information:\n\n1. Complementary base pairing: The nitrogenous bases in DNA pair up in a specific manner, with adenine always pairing with thymine (A-T) and guanine always pairing with cytosine (G-C). This complementary base pairing ensures that the genetic information is accurately stored and can be replicated during cell division. The hydrogen bonds between the complementary bases provide stability to the DNA molecule.\n\n2. Double helix structure: The double helix structure of DNA allows it to store a large amount of genetic information in a compact form. The two strands of DNA are twisted around each other, which enables the molecule to be tightly packed within the cell nucleus. This structure also provides protection to the genetic information, as the important nitrogenous bases are located inside the helix, shielded from potential damage.\n\n3. Semi-conservative replication: The double-stranded nature of DNA allows for semi-conservative replication, which is essential for the accurate transmission of genetic information during cell division. During replication, the two strands of DNA separate, and each strand serves as a template for the synthesis of a new complementary strand. This ensures that each daughter cell receives an identical copy of the genetic information.\n\n4. Sequence of bases: The specific sequence of the nitrogenous bases in a DNA molecule encodes the genetic information. The order of the bases determines the information for synthesizing proteins, which are the functional molecules in cells. The genetic code is read in triplets of bases called codons, with each codon specifying a particular amino acid to be added to a growing protein chain.\n\nIn summary, the structure of DNA, with its double helix, complementary base pairing, and specific sequence of nitrogenous bases, is crucial for its function in storing and transmitting genetic information. This structure allows for the accurate replication and expression of genetic information, which is essential for the growth, development, and reproduction of living organisms."
