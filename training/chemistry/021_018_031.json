    "message_2": "A substance with a strong network of covalent bonds in its structure is expected to have a much higher boiling point compared to a substance with weak London dispersion forces.\n\nCovalent bonds are strong chemical bonds formed by the sharing of electrons between atoms. A substance with a strong network of covalent bonds, such as a covalent network solid (e.g., diamond or quartz), has a very high boiling point due to the significant amount of energy required to break these strong bonds.\n\nOn the other hand, London dispersion forces are weak intermolecular forces that arise from temporary fluctuations in electron distribution around molecules. These forces are generally much weaker than covalent bonds. Substances with weak London dispersion forces, such as nonpolar gases (e.g., helium or methane), typically have low boiling points because less energy is needed to overcome these weak forces and separate the molecules.\n\nIn summary, the substance with a strong network of covalent bonds will have a much higher boiling point compared to the substance with weak London dispersion forces."
