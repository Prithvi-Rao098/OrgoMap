    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the vaporization of 25.0 grams of water, we first need to determine the number of moles of water present. The molar mass of water (H2O) is 18.015 g/mol.\n\nNumber of moles of water = (mass of water) / (molar mass of water)\nNumber of moles of water = 25.0 g / 18.015 g/mol = 1.387 moles\n\nNow, we can use the molar enthalpy of vaporization to calculate the standard enthalpy change for the vaporization of 25.0 grams of water.\n\nStandard enthalpy change = (number of moles of water) × (molar enthalpy of vaporization)\nStandard enthalpy change = 1.387 moles × 40.7 kJ/mol = 56.5 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the vaporization of 25.0 grams of water at 100°C is 56.5 kJ."
