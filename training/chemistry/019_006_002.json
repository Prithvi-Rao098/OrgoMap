    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction A + B ⇌ C, we can use the formula:\n\nKc = [C] / ([A] * [B])\n\nGiven the equilibrium concentrations:\n[A] = 0.1 M\n[B] = 0.2 M\n[C] = 0.05 M\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\nKc = (0.05) / (0.1 * 0.2)\n\nKc = 0.05 / 0.02\n\nKc = 2.5\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction A + B ⇌ C is 2.5."
