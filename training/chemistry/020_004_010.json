    "message_2": "The addition of a catalyst to a chemical reaction does not affect the equilibrium position or the equilibrium constant (K) at a constant temperature. A catalyst works by lowering the activation energy of a reaction, which increases the rate at which the reaction proceeds. However, it affects both the forward and reverse reactions equally, so the equilibrium position remains unchanged.\n\nAn example of a reversible reaction is the synthesis of ammonia (Haber-Bosch process):\n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) â‡Œ 2NH3(g)\n\nIn this reaction, nitrogen gas reacts with hydrogen gas to form ammonia gas. The equilibrium constant (K) for this reaction is given by:\n\nK = [NH3]^2 / ([N2] * [H2]^3)\n\nIf a catalyst, such as iron with potassium oxide as a promoter, is added to the reaction, it will increase the rate at which both the forward and reverse reactions occur. However, since the catalyst affects both reactions equally, the ratio of the concentrations of the reactants and products at equilibrium remains the same, and the equilibrium constant (K) is not affected.\n\nIn summary, a catalyst speeds up the rate at which a reaction reaches equilibrium, but it does not change the equilibrium position or the equilibrium constant of the reaction at a constant temperature."
