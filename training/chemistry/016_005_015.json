    "message_1": "A student wants to determine the enthalpy of combustion of octane. They measured the temperature change of 200 mL of water in a calorimeter when 1.50 grams of octane was burned completely. The initial temperature of the water was 25.0 °C and it reached a maximum of 45.0 °C. What is the enthalpy of combustion of octane?",
    "message_2": "To determine the enthalpy of combustion of octane, we first need to calculate the heat absorbed by the water in the calorimeter. We can do this using the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat absorbed, m is the mass of the water, c is the specific heat capacity of water, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nGiven:\nMass of water (m) = 200 mL (assuming the density of water is 1 g/mL, this is equivalent to 200 g)\nSpecific heat capacity of water (c) = 4.18 J/g°C\nInitial temperature (T_initial) = 25.0 °C\nFinal temperature (T_final) = 45.0 °C\n\nFirst, we calculate the change in temperature (ΔT):\nΔT = T_final - T_initial = 45.0 °C - 25.0 °C = 20.0 °C\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat absorbed by the water (q):\nq = mcΔT = (200 g)(4.18 J/g°C)(20.0 °C) = 16720 J\n\nNext, we need to determine the moles of octane burned. The molecular weight of octane (C8H18) is:\n(12.01 g/mol x 8) + (1.01 g/mol x 18) = 114.23 g/mol\n\nGiven that 1.50 grams of octane was burned, we can calculate the moles of octane:\nmoles of octane = 1.50 g / 114.23 g/mol = 0.0131 mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy of combustion of octane (ΔH_combustion) per mole:\nΔH_combustion = -q / moles of octane = -16720 J / 0.0131 mol = -1274800 J/mol\n\nThe enthalpy of combustion of octane is approximately -1,274,800 J/mol."
