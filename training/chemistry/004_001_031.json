    "message_2": "To find the molarity of the hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution, we can use the concept of stoichiometry and the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between HCl and NaOH:\n\nHCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H2O(l)\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that the mole ratio between HCl and NaOH is 1:1.\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of NaOH:\n\nmoles of NaOH = Molarity of NaOH × Volume of NaOH\nmoles of NaOH = 0.100 M × 35.0 mL × (1 L / 1000 mL) = 0.00350 moles\n\nSince the mole ratio between HCl and NaOH is 1:1, the moles of HCl will also be 0.00350 moles.\n\nNow, we can find the molarity of the HCl solution:\n\nMolarity of HCl = moles of HCl / Volume of HCl\nMolarity of HCl = 0.00350 moles / (25.0 mL × (1 L / 1000 mL))\nMolarity of HCl = 0.00350 moles / 0.025 L = 0.140 M\n\nSo, the molarity of the hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution is 0.140 M."
