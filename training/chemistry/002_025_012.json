    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic moment of the Ni(CN)4 2- complex ion, we first need to determine the oxidation state of the nickel (Ni) atom and the number of unpaired electrons in its d-orbitals.\n\nThe complex ion is Ni(CN)4 2-. The cyanide ion (CN-) has a charge of -1, so the total charge contributed by the four cyanide ions is -4. To balance the overall charge of the complex ion (-2), the nickel atom must have an oxidation state of +2.\n\nNow, let's find the electron configuration of Ni2+. The atomic number of nickel is 28, and its ground state electron configuration is [Ar] 3d8 4s2. When nickel loses two electrons to form Ni2+, the electron configuration becomes [Ar] 3d8.\n\nIn a tetrahedral complex, the d-orbitals split into two groups: a lower-energy group (dxy, dxz, dyz) and a higher-energy group (dz2, dx2-y2). However, the energy difference between these groups is relatively small in a tetrahedral complex compared to an octahedral complex. Therefore, the electrons will fill the orbitals according to Hund's rule, which states that electrons will occupy orbitals singly before pairing up.\n\nThe electron configuration of Ni2+ in the Ni(CN)4 2- complex is as follows:\n\nLower-energy group (t2): dxy (↑), dxz (↑), dyz (↑)\nHigher-energy group (e): dz2 (↑), dx2-y2 (↑)\n\nThere are no unpaired electrons in the Ni(CN)4 2- complex ion.\n\nThe magnetic moment (μ) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nμ = √(n(n+2)),\n\nwhere n is the number of unpaired electrons.\n\nSince there are no unpaired electrons (n = 0), the magnetic moment of the Ni(CN)4 2- complex ion is:\n\nμ = √(0(0+2)) = 0\n\nThe magnetic moment of the Ni(CN)4 2- complex ion is 0, indicating that the complex is diamagnetic."
