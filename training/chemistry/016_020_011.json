    "message_1": "Calculate the enthalpy of desorption of carbon dioxide (CO2) from a surface if the surface coverage is 0.025 mol/m² and the temperature is 298 K. The enthalpy of adsorption for CO2 on the surface is -35.8 kJ/mol. The equilibrium constant (K) for the reaction is 2.99 x 10⁶ at 298 K.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of desorption of CO2 from the surface, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH_desorption = -ΔH_adsorption\n\nGiven that the enthalpy of adsorption for CO2 on the surface is -35.8 kJ/mol, the enthalpy of desorption can be calculated as:\n\nΔH_desorption = -(-35.8 kJ/mol) = 35.8 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the enthalpy of desorption of CO2 from the surface is 35.8 kJ/mol."
