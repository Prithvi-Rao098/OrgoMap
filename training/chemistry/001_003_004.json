    "message_2": "(2R,3S)-butane-1,4-diol has two chiral centers: one at carbon 2 and another at carbon 3. \n\nThere are four possible stereoisomers for this compound, which can be represented as follows:\n\n1. (2R,3S)-butane-1,4-diol\n   HO-CH2-CH(2R)(OH)-CH(3S)(OH)-CH2-OH\n\n2. (2S,3S)-butane-1,4-diol\n   HO-CH2-CH(2S)(OH)-CH(3S)(OH)-CH2-OH\n\n3. (2R,3R)-butane-1,4-diol\n   HO-CH2-CH(2R)(OH)-CH(3R)(OH)-CH2-OH\n\n4. (2S,3R)-butane-1,4-diol\n   HO-CH2-CH(2S)(OH)-CH(3R)(OH)-CH2-OH\n\nThese four stereoisomers are the possible combinations of the R and S configurations at the two chiral centers."
