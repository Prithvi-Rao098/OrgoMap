    "message_2": "When acetic acid reacts with thionyl chloride, the product formed is acetyl chloride. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nCH3COOH + SOCl2 â†’ CH3COCl + SO2 + HCl\n\nThe mechanism of this transformation involves the following steps:\n\n1. Nucleophilic attack: The oxygen atom of the carboxylic acid (acetic acid) attacks the sulfur atom of thionyl chloride, forming an intermediate with a tetrahedral geometry around the sulfur atom.\n\n2. Proton transfer: A chloride ion (Cl-) from thionyl chloride abstracts a proton (H+) from the oxygen atom of the intermediate, forming hydrochloric acid (HCl).\n\n3. Elimination of SO2: The intermediate collapses, releasing sulfur dioxide (SO2) and forming the final product, acetyl chloride (CH3COCl).\n\nThis reaction is a common method for converting carboxylic acids into acyl chlorides, which are more reactive and versatile intermediates in organic synthesis."
