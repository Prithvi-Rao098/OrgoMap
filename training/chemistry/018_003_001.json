    "message_2": "A 10°C temperature increase generally has a significant effect on the rate of a chemical reaction. In the case of the reaction between hydrochloric acid (HCl) and magnesium (Mg), the rate of reaction will increase with the temperature rise.\n\nThe reaction between HCl and Mg can be represented by the following equation:\n\nMg (s) + 2HCl (aq) → MgCl2 (aq) + H2 (g)\n\nAccording to the collision theory, an increase in temperature leads to an increase in the kinetic energy of the reacting particles. This results in more frequent and energetic collisions between the reactant molecules, which in turn increases the probability of successful collisions that lead to the formation of products.\n\nFor many reactions, the rate approximately doubles for every 10°C increase in temperature, although this is just a rough estimate and the actual increase may vary depending on the specific reaction. In the case of the HCl and Mg reaction, you can expect a significant increase in the rate of reaction due to the 10°C temperature increase, leading to faster production of magnesium chloride (MgCl2) and hydrogen gas (H2)."
