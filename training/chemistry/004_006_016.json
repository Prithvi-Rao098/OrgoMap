    "message_1": "What is the purity of an unknown sample of compound X, and does it meet the purity criteria for use in a pharmaceutical formulation? Determine the melting point range of the unknown sample of compound X and compare it to the literature values for pure compound X. If the melting point range of the unknown sample matches that of the literature value, then the compound can be considered pure. However, if the melting point range is lower than that of the literature value, it indicates impurities in the compound. The degree of impurity can be calculated by comparing the melting point range of the unknown sample to that of a sample of compound X with a known degree of impurity.",
    "message_2": "To determine the purity of the unknown sample of compound X and whether it meets the purity criteria for use in a pharmaceutical formulation, follow these steps:\n\n1. Obtain the literature value for the melting point range of pure compound X. This information can typically be found in chemical databases, reference books, or scientific articles.\n\n2. Measure the melting point range of the unknown sample of compound X using a melting point apparatus. To do this, place a small amount of the sample in a capillary tube and insert it into the apparatus. Gradually increase the temperature and observe the temperature at which the sample starts to melt and the temperature at which it completely melts. This will give you the melting point range of the unknown sample.\n\n3. Compare the melting point range of the unknown sample to the literature value for pure compound X. If the melting point range of the unknown sample matches that of the literature value, the compound can be considered pure and likely meets the purity criteria for use in a pharmaceutical formulation.\n\n4. If the melting point range of the unknown sample is lower than the literature value, it indicates the presence of impurities in the compound. To determine the degree of impurity, compare the melting point range of the unknown sample to that of a sample of compound X with a known degree of impurity. This information can be obtained from the literature or by conducting experiments with samples of compound X with varying degrees of impurity.\n\n5. Calculate the degree of impurity in the unknown sample by comparing its melting point range to that of the known impure samples. The greater the difference in melting point ranges, the higher the degree of impurity in the unknown sample.\n\n6. Finally, compare the degree of impurity in the unknown sample to the purity criteria for use in a pharmaceutical formulation. If the degree of impurity is within the acceptable range, the compound can be used in the formulation. If not, further purification steps may be necessary to meet the required purity standards."
