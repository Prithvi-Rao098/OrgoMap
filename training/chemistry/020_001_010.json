    "message_1": "What is the equilibrium constant for the following reaction at 25°C: \n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g) \n\nGiven that the equilibrium concentration of N2 and H2 are 0.250 M and 0.750 M respectively, and the equilibrium concentration of NH3 is 0.0500 M.",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction, we can use the expression:\n\nKc = [NH3]^2 / ([N2] * [H2]^3)\n\nwhere the concentrations are given at equilibrium.\n\nGiven the equilibrium concentrations:\n[N2] = 0.250 M\n[H2] = 0.750 M\n[NH3] = 0.0500 M\n\nPlug these values into the Kc expression:\n\nKc = (0.0500)^2 / (0.250 * (0.750)^3)\n\nKc = 0.002500 / (0.250 * 0.421875)\n\nKc = 0.002500 / 0.10546875\n\nKc ≈ 23.7\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction at 25°C is approximately 23.7."
