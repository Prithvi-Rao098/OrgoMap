    "message_2": "In the compound NaClO3 (sodium chlorate), the oxidation states of each element are as follows:\n\n1. Sodium (Na): +1\n2. Chlorine (Cl): +5\n3. Oxygen (O): -2\n\nHere's the breakdown of how we determine these oxidation states:\n\n- Sodium is in Group 1 of the periodic table, and elements in this group have an oxidation state of +1.\n- Oxygen is in Group 16, and elements in this group typically have an oxidation state of -2.\n- To determine the oxidation state of chlorine, we can use the formula for the compound: NaClO3. Since there is one sodium atom (+1) and three oxygen atoms (-2 each), the total oxidation state of the compound should be 0 (as it is a neutral compound). Therefore, the oxidation state of chlorine can be calculated as follows:\n\n  +1 + x + 3(-2) = 0\n  x - 6 = -1\n  x = +5\n\nSo, the oxidation state of chlorine in NaClO3 is +5."
