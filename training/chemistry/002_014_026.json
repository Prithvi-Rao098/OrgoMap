    "message_2": "To calculate the formal charge on the nitrogen atom in the ammonium ion (NH4+), we can use the following formula:\n\nFormal charge = (Valence electrons of the atom) - (Non-bonding electrons) - (1/2 × Bonding electrons)\n\nFor nitrogen, the number of valence electrons is 5. In the ammonium ion, nitrogen forms 4 single bonds with 4 hydrogen atoms, which means it has 4 bonding electrons and no non-bonding electrons.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nFormal charge = (5) - (0) - (1/2 × 4)\nFormal charge = 5 - 0 - 2\nFormal charge = 3\n\nSo, the formal charge on the nitrogen atom in the ammonium ion (NH4+) is +1."
