    "message_2": "The reaction between Copper(II) chloride (CuCl₂) and Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is a double displacement reaction, which results in the formation of Copper(II) hydroxide (Cu(OH)₂) and Sodium chloride (NaCl). The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nCuCl₂ (aq) + 2 NaOH (aq) → Cu(OH)₂ (s) + 2 NaCl (aq)"
