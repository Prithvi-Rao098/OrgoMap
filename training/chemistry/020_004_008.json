    "message_2": "The addition of a catalyst to a reaction does not affect the equilibrium position of the reaction at constant temperature and pressure. A catalyst works by lowering the activation energy of the reaction, which increases the rate of both the forward and reverse reactions. However, it does not change the equilibrium constant (Kc) or the equilibrium concentrations of the reactants and products.\n\nIn the presence or absence of a catalyst, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction remains the same. To calculate Kc, you would need the equilibrium concentrations of the reactants and products, which are not provided in this case.\n\nWhen a catalyst is added to the reaction, it lowers the activation energy for both the forward and reverse reactions. This means that the reaction rates for both the forward and reverse reactions will increase. However, since both reaction rates increase by the same factor, the equilibrium position of the reaction remains unchanged. In other words, the ratio of the concentrations of products to reactants at equilibrium will be the same with or without the catalyst.\n\nIn summary, the addition of a catalyst to the reaction N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g) will not change the equilibrium position or the equilibrium constant (Kc) of the reaction. It will only increase the rate at which the reaction reaches equilibrium."
