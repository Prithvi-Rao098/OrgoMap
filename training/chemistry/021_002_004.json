    "message_1": "What is the bond length between two oxygen atoms that are connected by a double bond in a molecule of carbon dioxide? The electronegativity of oxygen is 3.44 and carbon dioxide has a linear geometry with an O=C=O bond angle of 180 degrees.",
    "message_2": "The bond length between two oxygen atoms connected by a double bond in a molecule of carbon dioxide is not directly available, as the oxygen atoms are not directly bonded to each other. Instead, they are bonded to the central carbon atom. The bond length we can discuss is the bond length between the carbon and oxygen atoms in the carbon dioxide molecule.\n\nThe carbon-oxygen double bond length in carbon dioxide is approximately 1.20 Ã… (angstroms). This value is based on experimental data and is a well-established bond length for carbon-oxygen double bonds in carbon dioxide."
