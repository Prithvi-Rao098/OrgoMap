    "message_2": "The synthesis of ibuprofen from 2-methylpropylbenzene (isobutylbenzene) and carbon dioxide involves several steps. The overall process is known as the Boots synthesis, which was developed by the Boots Company in the 1960s. Here is the mechanism for the synthesis:\n\n1. Friedel-Crafts acylation: The first step involves the Friedel-Crafts acylation of 2-methylpropylbenzene with acetyl chloride in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, such as aluminum chloride (AlCl3). This reaction forms a ketone, 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanone.\n\n2. Reduction of the ketone: The ketone formed in the previous step is reduced to an alcohol using a reducing agent, such as sodium borohydride (NaBH4) or lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4). This results in the formation of 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanol.\n\n3. Carboxylation: The alcohol is then reacted with carbon dioxide (CO2) under high pressure and temperature in the presence of a base, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This step forms the carboxylic acid, 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionic acid, which is the final product, ibuprofen.\n\nKey factors that influence the yield and purity of the final product include:\n\n1. Reaction conditions: The temperature, pressure, and reaction time can significantly impact the yield and purity of the product. For example, the carboxylation step requires high pressure and temperature for optimal results.\n\n2. Choice of catalysts and reagents: The choice of catalysts and reagents can also affect the yield and purity. For instance, using a more selective catalyst in the Friedel-Crafts acylation can help minimize side reactions and improve the yield.\n\n3. Purification techniques: The efficiency of purification techniques, such as recrystallization, chromatography, or distillation, can impact the purity of the final product. Proper selection and optimization of these techniques are essential for obtaining high-purity ibuprofen.\n\n4. Control of side reactions: Side reactions can lead to the formation of impurities and by-products, which can reduce the yield and purity of the final product. Monitoring and controlling these side reactions are crucial for improving the overall synthesis process."
