    "message_2": "In carbon dioxide (CO2), there are two carbon-oxygen double bonds. The bond order of a carbon-oxygen double bond is 2, as there are two shared electron pairs between the carbon and oxygen atoms.\n\nThe bond length of a carbon-oxygen double bond in CO2 is approximately 1.16 Å (angstroms) or 116 pm (picometers). This value can vary slightly depending on the specific molecule and its environment, but 1.16 Å is a commonly accepted value for the bond length of a C=O double bond in CO2."
