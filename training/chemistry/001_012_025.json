    "message_2": "Primary, secondary, and tertiary amines are organic compounds containing nitrogen atoms with different numbers of alkyl or aryl groups attached to them. The classification is based on the number of carbon atoms directly bonded to the nitrogen atom.\n\n1. Primary amines (1°): In primary amines, the nitrogen atom is bonded to one alkyl or aryl group and two hydrogen atoms. The general formula for primary amines is RNH2, where R represents an alkyl or aryl group. An example of a primary amine is methylamine (CH3NH2).\n\n2. Secondary amines (2°): In secondary amines, the nitrogen atom is bonded to two alkyl or aryl groups and one hydrogen atom. The general formula for secondary amines is R2NH, where R represents an alkyl or aryl group. An example of a secondary amine is dimethylamine [(CH3)2NH].\n\n3. Tertiary amines (3°): In tertiary amines, the nitrogen atom is bonded to three alkyl or aryl groups and no hydrogen atoms. The general formula for tertiary amines is R3N, where R represents an alkyl or aryl group. An example of a tertiary amine is trimethylamine [(CH3)3N].\n\nProperties and reactivity:\n\nPrimary amines have two hydrogen atoms bonded to the nitrogen atom, which makes them more basic and nucleophilic compared to secondary and tertiary amines. This is because the electron pair on the nitrogen atom is more available for donation in primary amines. As a result, primary amines are more reactive in nucleophilic substitution and acid-base reactions.\n\nSecondary amines have one hydrogen atom bonded to the nitrogen atom, making them less basic and nucleophilic than primary amines but more basic and nucleophilic than tertiary amines.\n\nTertiary amines have no hydrogen atoms bonded to the nitrogen atom, making them the least basic and nucleophilic among the three types of amines. However, they are still basic due to the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom.\n\nComparison between primary amine and its corresponding amide:\n\nAn amide is an organic compound containing a carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to a nitrogen atom. The general formula for primary amides is RCONH2, where R represents an alkyl or aryl group. An example of a primary amide is acetamide (CH3CONH2).\n\nProperties:\n1. Basicity: Primary amines are more basic than their corresponding amides due to the presence of two hydrogen atoms bonded to the nitrogen atom, making the lone pair of electrons more available for donation. In amides, the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom is involved in resonance with the carbonyl group, making them less available for donation and thus less basic.\n\n2. Reactivity: Primary amines are more nucleophilic and reactive than their corresponding amides. This is because the electron pair on the nitrogen atom is more available for donation in primary amines, whereas, in amides, the electron pair is involved in resonance with the carbonyl group, making them less nucleophilic.\n\n3. Hydrogen bonding: Both primary amines and amides can form hydrogen bonds due to the presence of N-H bonds. However, amides can also form hydrogen bonds through the carbonyl oxygen, making them more capable of forming hydrogen bonds than primary amines.\n\n4. Stability: Amides are generally more stable than primary amines due to the resonance between the nitrogen atom's lone pair and the carbonyl group, which distributes the electron density and stabilizes the molecule.\n\n5. Boiling point: Amides usually have higher boiling points than primary amines due to their ability to form more hydrogen bonds through the carbonyl oxygen and the N-H bond."
