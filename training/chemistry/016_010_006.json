    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat absorbed when sodium hydroxide is dissolved in water, we need to use the following formula:\n\nq = n × ΔH\n\nwhere q is the heat absorbed (in joules), n is the number of moles of NaOH, and ΔH is the enthalpy of solution (in joules per mole).\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of NaOH. The molar mass of NaOH is:\n\nNaOH = Na + O + H = 22.99 g/mol + 16.00 g/mol + 1.01 g/mol = 40.00 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the number of moles (n) of NaOH:\n\nn = mass / molar mass = 10 g / 40.00 g/mol = 0.25 mol\n\nNext, we need to convert the enthalpy of solution from kilojoules per mole to joules per mole:\n\nΔH = -44.51 kJ/mol × 1000 J/1 kJ = -44510 J/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat absorbed (q):\n\nq = n × ΔH = 0.25 mol × -44510 J/mol = -11127.5 J\n\nSince the value is negative, it means that the heat is released (exothermic reaction) rather than absorbed. Therefore, the amount of heat absorbed is 0 J, and the amount of heat released is 11127.5 J."
