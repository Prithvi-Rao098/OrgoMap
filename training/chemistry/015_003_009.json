The C-O bond length is 1.21 Å.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the fundamental vibrational frequency and the force constant of the C-O bond in formaldehyde, we first need to determine the reduced mass of the C-O bond. The reduced mass (μ) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nμ = (m₁ * m₂) / (m₁ + m₂)\n\nwhere m₁ and m₂ are the masses of the two bonded atoms (in this case, carbon and oxygen). We need to convert the atomic mass units (amu) to kilograms (kg) using the conversion factor 1 amu = 1.66054 × 10⁻²⁷ kg.\n\nm_C = 12.0 amu * 1.66054 × 10⁻²⁷ kg/amu = 1.99265 × 10⁻²⁶ kg\nm_O = 16.0 amu * 1.66054 × 10⁻²⁷ kg/amu = 2.65686 × 10⁻²⁶ kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the reduced mass:\n\nμ = (1.99265 × 10⁻²⁶ kg * 2.65686 × 10⁻²⁶ kg) / (1.99265 × 10⁻²⁶ kg + 2.65686 × 10⁻²⁶ kg) = 1.14077 × 10⁻²⁶ kg\n\nNext, we can calculate the fundamental vibrational frequency (ν) using the formula:\n\nν = (1 / 2π) * √(k / μ)\n\nwhere k is the force constant. However, we don't have the value of k yet. We can use the formula for the vibrational frequency in wavenumbers (cm⁻¹):\n\nν̃ = (1 / 2πc) * √(k / μ)\n\nwhere c is the speed of light in cm/s (c = 2.99792 × 10¹⁰ cm/s). Rearranging the formula to solve for k, we get:\n\nk = (ν̃ * 2πc)² * μ\n\nNow, we need to find the value of ν̃. The fundamental vibrational frequency of the C-O bond in formaldehyde is approximately 1855 cm⁻¹ (from experimental data). Plugging this value into the formula, we can calculate the force constant:\n\nk = (1855 cm⁻¹ * 2π * 2.99792 × 10¹⁰ cm/s)² * 1.14077 × 10⁻²⁶ kg = 1397.42 N/m\n\nNow that we have the force constant, we can calculate the fundamental vibrational frequency in Hz:\n\nν = (1 / 2π) * √(1397.42 N/m / 1.14077 × 10⁻²⁶ kg) = 5.614 × 10¹³ Hz\n\nIn summary, the fundamental vibrational frequency of the C-O bond in formaldehyde is approximately 1855 cm⁻¹ (or 5.614 × 10¹³ Hz), and the force constant is approximately 1397.42 N/m."
