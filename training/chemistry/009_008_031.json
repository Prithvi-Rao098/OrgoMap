    "message_2": "Polonium-210 (Po-210) undergoes alpha decay, emitting alpha particles with a maximum energy of approximately 5.3 MeV (Mega-electron volts).\n\nThe range of alpha particles in air depends on various factors such as energy, pressure, and temperature. However, under normal conditions (room temperature and atmospheric pressure), the range of 5.3 MeV alpha particles in air is approximately 3-4 cm (centimeters). Alpha particles lose their energy quickly due to ionization and have a relatively short range in air."
