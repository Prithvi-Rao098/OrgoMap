    "message_2": "To calculate the standard free energy change (ΔG°) for the given reaction, we first need to determine the overall cell potential (E°) for the reaction. We can do this by subtracting the reduction potential of the half-reaction that will be reversed (oxidation) from the reduction potential of the half-reaction that will remain as reduction.\n\nIn this case, the Fe2+ is being oxidized to Fe3+, so we will reverse the first half-reaction:\n\nFe2+(aq) -> Fe3+(aq) + e-    E° = -0.77 V\n\nThe second half-reaction remains the same:\n\nCu2+(aq) + e- -> Cu+(aq)     E° = 0.16 V\n\nNow, we can add the two half-reactions together:\n\n2(Fe2+(aq) -> Fe3+(aq) + e-)    2E° = -1.54 V\nCu2+(aq) + e- -> Cu+(aq)        E° = 0.16 V\n----------------------------------------------\n2Fe2+(aq) + Cu2+(aq) -> 2Fe3+(aq) + Cu+(aq)    E° = -1.54 + 0.16 = -1.38 V\n\nNow that we have the overall cell potential (E°), we can calculate the standard free energy change (ΔG°) using the following equation:\n\nΔG° = -nFE°\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of electrons transferred (in this case, 2), F is Faraday's constant (96,485 C/mol), and E° is the overall cell potential.\n\nΔG° = -2 * 96,485 * (-1.38)\nΔG° = 266,298 J/mol\n\nSo, the standard free energy change (ΔG°) for the given reaction at 25°C is 266,298 J/mol."
