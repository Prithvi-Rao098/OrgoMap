    "message_2": "When calcium carbonate (CaCO3) is subjected to heat in a decomposition reaction, it breaks down into calcium oxide (CaO) and carbon dioxide (CO2). The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nCaCO3 (s) → CaO (s) + CO2 (g)\n\nTo calculate the percentage yield of calcium oxide, we first need to determine the theoretical yield. We can do this using stoichiometry.\n\n1. Calculate the molar mass of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and calcium oxide (CaO).\nCaCO3: (40.08) + (12.01) + (3 × 16.00) = 100.09 g/mol\nCaO: (40.08) + (16.00) = 56.08 g/mol\n\n2. Convert the given mass of calcium carbonate to moles.\n5 g CaCO3 × (1 mol CaCO3 / 100.09 g CaCO3) = 0.0499 mol CaCO3\n\n3. Use the stoichiometry of the balanced equation to determine the moles of calcium oxide produced.\n1 mol CaCO3 → 1 mol CaO\n0.0499 mol CaCO3 → 0.0499 mol CaO\n\n4. Convert the moles of calcium oxide to grams.\n0.0499 mol CaO × (56.08 g CaO / 1 mol CaO) = 2.80 g CaO (theoretical yield)\n\n5. Calculate the percentage yield.\nPercentage yield = (actual yield / theoretical yield) × 100\nPercentage yield = (2 g CaO / 2.80 g CaO) × 100 = 71.43%\n\nSo, the percentage yield of calcium oxide produced when 5 grams of calcium carbonate are heated and 2 grams of calcium oxide are obtained is 71.43%."
