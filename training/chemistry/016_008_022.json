    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat required to melt 50 grams of ice at 0°C, we need to first determine the number of moles of ice and then use the enthalpy of fusion to find the heat required.\n\n1. Calculate the number of moles of ice:\nThe molecular weight of water (H2O) is 18.015 g/mol. \n\nNumber of moles = mass / molecular weight\nNumber of moles = 50 g / 18.015 g/mol = 2.776 moles\n\n2. Calculate the heat required using the enthalpy of fusion:\nHeat required = number of moles × enthalpy of fusion\nHeat required = 2.776 moles × 6.01 kJ/mol = 16.682 kJ\n\nTherefore, the amount of heat required to melt 50 grams of ice at 0°C is 16.682 kJ."
