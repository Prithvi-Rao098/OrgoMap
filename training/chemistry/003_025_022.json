    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction A + B ⇌ C, we need to first determine the equilibrium concentrations of A and B. \n\nAt the beginning of the reaction, the concentrations are as follows:\n[A] = 0.2 M\n[B] = 0.3 M\n[C] = 0 M\n\nAt equilibrium, we know that the concentration of C is 0.1 M. Since the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1:1, the change in concentration for A and B is equal to the change in concentration for C. Therefore, the equilibrium concentrations are:\n\n[A] = 0.2 M - 0.1 M = 0.1 M\n[B] = 0.3 M - 0.1 M = 0.2 M\n[C] = 0.1 M\n\nNow, we can use the equilibrium expression to find Kc:\n\nKc = [C] / ([A] * [B])\n\nPlugging in the equilibrium concentrations:\n\nKc = (0.1) / (0.1 * 0.2) = 0.1 / 0.02 = 5\n\nThe equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction A + B ⇌ C is 5."
