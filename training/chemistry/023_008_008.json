    "message_2": "To calculate the theoretical yield of p-nitroaniline, we need to first determine the limiting reactant in the reaction. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nC6H7N + HNO3 → C6H6N2O2 + H2O\n\nAniline (C6H7N) has a molar mass of 93.13 g/mol, and nitric acid (HNO3) has a molar mass of 63.01 g/mol.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given masses of reactants to moles:\n\nmoles of aniline = (5 g) / (93.13 g/mol) = 0.0537 mol\nmoles of nitric acid = (10 g) / (63.01 g/mol) = 0.1587 mol\n\nNow, we need to determine the mole ratio of the reactants:\n\nmole ratio = moles of aniline / moles of nitric acid = 0.0537 / 0.1587 = 0.338\n\nThe stoichiometry of the balanced equation indicates that 1 mole of aniline reacts with 1 mole of nitric acid. Since the mole ratio is less than 1, aniline is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow, we can calculate the theoretical yield of p-nitroaniline (C6H6N2O2) using the stoichiometry of the balanced equation:\n\nmoles of p-nitroaniline = moles of aniline = 0.0537 mol\n\nThe molar mass of p-nitroaniline is 138.12 g/mol. Therefore, the theoretical yield of p-nitroaniline is:\n\ntheoretical yield = (0.0537 mol) × (138.12 g/mol) = 7.42 g\n\nSo, the theoretical yield of p-nitroaniline is 7.42 grams."
