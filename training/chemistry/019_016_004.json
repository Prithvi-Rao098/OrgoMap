    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the vaporization of 25 grams of water, we can use the following formula:\n\nΔH = n * ΔHvap\n\nwhere ΔH is the enthalpy change, n is the number of moles of water, and ΔHvap is the molar enthalpy of vaporization.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of water (n). The molar mass of water (H2O) is 18.015 g/mol.\n\nn = mass / molar mass\nn = 25 g / 18.015 g/mol\nn ≈ 1.387 moles\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change:\n\nΔH = n * ΔHvap\nΔH = 1.387 moles * 40.7 kJ/mol\nΔH ≈ 56.5 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the vaporization of 25 grams of water at 100 degrees Celsius and 1 atmosphere of pressure is approximately 56.5 kJ."
