    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant Kc, we first need to determine the equilibrium concentrations of all the species involved in the reaction. We are given the initial concentration of NOBr and the equilibrium concentration of NO. Let's use the balanced chemical equation to find the changes in concentrations and the equilibrium concentrations of NOBr and Br2.\n\nBalanced chemical equation:\n2NOBr (g) ⇌ 2NO (g) + Br2 (g)\n\nInitial concentrations:\n[NOBr] = 0.60 M\n[NO] = 0 M (since it is not mentioned)\n[Br2] = 0 M (since it is not mentioned)\n\nLet x be the change in concentration of NOBr at equilibrium. Since the stoichiometry of the reaction is 2:2:1, the changes in concentrations of NO and Br2 will be 2x and x, respectively.\n\nAt equilibrium:\n[NOBr] = 0.60 - x\n[NO] = 0 + 2x = 0.40 M (given)\n[Br2] = 0 + x\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n2x = 0.40\nx = 0.20\n\nNow we can find the equilibrium concentrations of NOBr and Br2:\n[NOBr] = 0.60 - x = 0.60 - 0.20 = 0.40 M\n[Br2] = x = 0.20 M\n\nNow we can find the equilibrium constant Kc using the expression for the reaction:\n\nKc = [NO]^2 * [Br2] / [NOBr]^2\n\nPlug in the equilibrium concentrations:\n\nKc = (0.40)^2 * (0.20) / (0.40)^2\nKc = (0.16 * 0.20) / 0.16\nKc = 0.032 / 0.16\nKc = 0.20\n\nThe equilibrium constant Kc for the reaction is 0.20."
