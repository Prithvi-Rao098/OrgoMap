    "message_2": "Increasing the temperature in a chemical reaction generally increases the rate of the reaction. This is because the molecules have more kinetic energy at higher temperatures, which leads to more frequent and energetic collisions between the reacting particles.\n\nIn the case of the reaction between sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and magnesium metal (Mg), the reaction can be represented by the following balanced equation:\n\nMg(s) + H2SO4(aq) â†’ MgSO4(aq) + H2(g)\n\nAs the temperature increases, the rate of this reaction will also increase. This is due to the increased frequency and energy of collisions between the magnesium metal and the sulfuric acid molecules, resulting in a faster formation of magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) and hydrogen gas (H2)."
