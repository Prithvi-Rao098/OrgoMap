    "message_1": "What is the mass percent of silver (Ag) in a 10 g sample of an alloy if it requires 5000 coulombs of electricity to completely reduce all the silver to solid metal during coulometric analysis?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of Faraday's laws of electrolysis. Faraday's first law states that the amount of a substance deposited or dissolved at an electrode during electrolysis is directly proportional to the quantity of electricity passed through the electrolyte.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of silver (Ag) deposited during the electrolysis process. To do this, we can use the formula:\n\nmoles of Ag = (coulombs) / (Faraday's constant × n)\n\nwhere:\n- coulombs = 5000 C (given)\n- Faraday's constant = 96485 C/mol (constant)\n- n = number of electrons involved in the redox reaction of Ag\n\nThe redox reaction of silver during electrolysis is:\n\nAg⁺ + e⁻ → Ag\n\nIn this reaction, one electron (e⁻) is involved in the reduction of silver ion (Ag⁺) to solid silver (Ag). So, n = 1.\n\nNow, we can calculate the moles of Ag:\n\nmoles of Ag = (5000 C) / (96485 C/mol × 1)\nmoles of Ag ≈ 0.0518 mol\n\nNext, we need to find the mass of silver deposited. We can use the formula:\n\nmass of Ag = moles of Ag × molar mass of Ag\n\nThe molar mass of silver (Ag) is 107.87 g/mol. Therefore:\n\nmass of Ag = 0.0518 mol × 107.87 g/mol\nmass of Ag ≈ 5.59 g\n\nNow, we can find the mass percent of silver (Ag) in the 10 g sample of the alloy:\n\nmass percent of Ag = (mass of Ag / total mass of alloy) × 100\nmass percent of Ag = (5.59 g / 10 g) × 100\nmass percent of Ag ≈ 55.9%\n\nSo, the mass percent of silver (Ag) in the 10 g sample of the alloy is approximately 55.9%."
