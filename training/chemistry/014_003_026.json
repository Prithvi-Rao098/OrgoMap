    "message_2": "The coordination compound [Co(en)2Cl2]+ exhibits geometrical isomerism, specifically cis-trans (or syn-anti) isomerism. This type of isomerism occurs due to the different possible arrangements of the ligands around the central metal ion.\n\nIn this complex, Co is the central metal ion, en (ethylenediamine) is a bidentate ligand, and Cl is a monodentate ligand. The coordination number of Co in this complex is 6.\n\nThere are two possible geometrical isomers for this complex:\n\n1. cis-[Co(en)2Cl2]+: In this isomer, the two Cl ligands are adjacent to each other (cis position). The two en ligands are also adjacent to each other.\n\nStructure:\n```\n       Cl\n        |\n        Co\n       /  \\\n     en    en\n```\n\n2. trans-[Co(en)2Cl2]+: In this isomer, the two Cl ligands are opposite to each other (trans position). The two en ligands are also opposite to each other.\n\nStructure:\n```\n       Cl\n        |\n        Co\n       /  \\\n     en    en\n        \\\n         Cl\n```\n\nSo, there are a total of 2 possible geometrical isomers for the coordination compound [Co(en)2Cl2]+."
