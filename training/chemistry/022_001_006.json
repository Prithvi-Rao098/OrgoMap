    "message_1": "If 10.0 grams of sodium reacts with chlorine gas, how many grams of sodium chloride can be produced? Write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between sodium and chlorine gas:\n\n2Na (s) + Cl2 (g) → 2NaCl (s)\n\nNext, we need to determine the molar mass of sodium (Na) and sodium chloride (NaCl). \n\nMolar mass of Na = 22.99 g/mol\nMolar mass of NaCl = 58.44 g/mol\n\nNow, we can use stoichiometry to find out how many grams of sodium chloride can be produced from 10.0 grams of sodium.\n\n1. Convert grams of sodium to moles:\n10.0 g Na × (1 mol Na / 22.99 g Na) = 0.435 mol Na\n\n2. Use the balanced chemical equation to find the moles of sodium chloride produced:\n0.435 mol Na × (2 mol NaCl / 2 mol Na) = 0.435 mol NaCl\n\n3. Convert moles of sodium chloride to grams:\n0.435 mol NaCl × (58.44 g NaCl / 1 mol NaCl) = 25.42 g NaCl\n\nSo, 25.42 grams of sodium chloride can be produced from 10.0 grams of sodium reacting with chlorine gas."
