    "message_2": "The heat of hydration for the reaction between solid calcium chloride (CaCl2) and water (H2O) can be determined by considering the heat released when 1 mole of CaCl2 dissolves in water.\n\nGiven that 1 mole of CaCl2 dissolves to produce 3 moles of ions and releases -82.8 kJ of heat in the process, we can calculate the heat of hydration per mole of CaCl2.\n\nSince the heat released is -82.8 kJ for 1 mole of CaCl2, the heat of hydration for the reaction between solid calcium chloride and water is:\n\nHeat of hydration = -82.8 kJ/mol"
