    "message_2": "In ethene (C2H4), each carbon atom is sp2 hybridized. This hybridization occurs when one s orbital and two p orbitals from each carbon atom combine to form three sp2 hybrid orbitals. \n\nThe geometry of the sp2 hybridized carbon atom is trigonal planar, with bond angles of approximately 120 degrees. In ethene, the two carbon atoms form a sigma bond with each other, and each carbon atom forms sigma bonds with two hydrogen atoms. Additionally, there is a pi bond between the two carbon atoms, which is formed by the overlap of the remaining unhybridized p orbitals.\n\nThe sp2 hybridization and trigonal planar geometry result in a planar molecule with bond angles of approximately 120 degrees between the carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen bonds. This geometry allows for the pi bond to form and contributes to the overall stability and reactivity of ethene."
