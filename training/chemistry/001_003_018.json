    "message_2": "If a compound contains one chiral carbon atom, it can have two possible stereoisomers: one R-configuration and one S-configuration. These two stereoisomers are enantiomers of each other. So, for a compound with the molecular formula C4H9Br and one chiral carbon atom, there are 2 possible stereoisomers."
