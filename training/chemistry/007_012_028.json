    "message_2": "Designing drugs to specifically target cancer cells with overexpressed HER2 receptors while avoiding healthy cells can be achieved through the following strategies:\n\n1. Monoclonal antibodies: Develop monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to the extracellular domain of the HER2 receptor. Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is an example of a monoclonal antibody that targets HER2-overexpressing cancer cells. It works by binding to the HER2 receptor, blocking its activation, and preventing cancer cell growth. Additionally, the immune system can recognize the antibody-bound cancer cells and destroy them.\n\n2. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs): Create ADCs by attaching a cytotoxic drug to a monoclonal antibody that specifically targets HER2 receptors. The ADC selectively binds to HER2-overexpressing cancer cells, and the cytotoxic drug is internalized and released within the cancer cell, leading to cell death. An example of an ADC targeting HER2 is ado-trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla).\n\n3. Small molecule inhibitors: Design small molecule inhibitors that selectively target the intracellular kinase domain of the HER2 receptor. These inhibitors can block the activation of the HER2 receptor and downstream signaling pathways, inhibiting cancer cell growth. Examples of small molecule inhibitors targeting HER2 include lapatinib and neratinib.\n\n4. Bispecific antibodies: Develop bispecific antibodies that can simultaneously bind to two different targets, such as HER2 and another receptor or protein overexpressed in cancer cells. This dual targeting can increase the specificity and efficacy of the drug while minimizing off-target effects on healthy cells.\n\n5. Personalized medicine: Utilize diagnostic tests to identify patients with HER2-overexpressing tumors and tailor treatment accordingly. This approach ensures that only patients with HER2-positive cancers receive HER2-targeted therapies, reducing the risk of side effects in patients without HER2 overexpression.\n\n6. Combination therapies: Combine HER2-targeted drugs with other cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy, radiation, or other targeted therapies. This can enhance the overall effectiveness of the treatment and potentially reduce the required dosage of each drug, minimizing side effects on healthy cells.\n\nBy employing these strategies, it is possible to design drugs that specifically target cancer cells with overexpressed HER2 receptors while avoiding healthy cells without HER2 receptors."
