    "message_2": "Retrosynthesis analysis is a problem-solving technique used by chemists to plan the synthesis of complex organic molecules by breaking them down into simpler, more readily available precursors. The process involves working backward from the target molecule to identify possible synthetic routes, taking into consideration the reactivity and availability of starting materials, as well as the efficiency and selectivity of the reactions involved.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how to use retrosynthesis analysis to plan the synthesis of a specific organic molecule:\n\n1. Identify the target molecule: Begin by clearly defining the structure of the organic molecule you want to synthesize.\n\n2. Analyze functional groups: Examine the target molecule and identify the functional groups present. This will help you recognize the types of reactions that may be involved in the synthesis.\n\n3. Break down the target molecule: Start working backward from the target molecule, breaking it down into simpler precursors by applying known reactions in reverse. This process is called disconnection. The goal is to identify simpler molecules that can be reconnected through synthetic reactions to form the target molecule.\n\n4. Choose strategic bonds to disconnect: Select bonds that, when disconnected, will lead to simpler and more readily available starting materials. Consider the reactivity of the functional groups involved and the feasibility of the disconnection.\n\n5. Identify possible synthetic routes: As you disconnect the target molecule, you'll generate a series of simpler precursors. For each disconnection, identify the forward synthetic reaction that would reconnect the precursors to form the target molecule. This will help you establish a set of possible synthetic routes.\n\n6. Evaluate synthetic routes: Assess the synthetic routes based on factors such as the availability of starting materials, the number of steps involved, the overall yield, and the environmental impact of the reactions. Choose the most efficient and practical route for your synthesis.\n\n7. Optimize the chosen route: Once you've selected a synthetic route, optimize the reaction conditions, such as temperature, solvent, and catalyst, to improve the yield and selectivity of the reactions.\n\n8. Perform the synthesis: Carry out the synthesis following the optimized route, starting with the simplest precursors and progressing through the reactions to form the target molecule.\n\n9. Analyze the results: After completing the synthesis, analyze the product to confirm that you have successfully synthesized the target molecule. If necessary, refine the synthetic route and repeat the process.\n\nBy using retrosynthesis analysis, chemists can systematically plan the synthesis of complex organic molecules, making the process more efficient and increasing the likelihood of success."
