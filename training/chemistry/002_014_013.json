    "message_2": "To calculate the formal charge on the central sulfur atom in the sulfate ion (SO₄²⁻), we can use the following formula:\n\nFormal charge = (valence electrons) - (non-bonding electrons) - 0.5 * (bonding electrons)\n\nIn the sulfate ion, the sulfur atom is surrounded by four oxygen atoms, and each sulfur-oxygen bond is a double bond. Sulfur belongs to group 6A in the periodic table, so it has 6 valence electrons.\n\nSince sulfur forms double bonds with each of the four oxygen atoms, it has no non-bonding electrons. Each double bond consists of 2 bonding electrons, and there are 4 double bonds, so there are a total of 8 bonding electrons.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nFormal charge = (6) - (0) - 0.5 * (8)\nFormal charge = 6 - 0 - 4\nFormal charge = +2\n\nThe formal charge on the central sulfur atom in the sulfate ion (SO₄²⁻) is +2."
