    "message_1": "What is the new equilibrium constant for the reaction N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g) if the initial concentration of NH3 is 0.1 M, N2 is 0.2 M, H2 is 0.3 M, and then more H2 is added until its concentration reaches 0.5 M?",
    "message_2": "The equilibrium constant (Kc) for a reaction does not change when the concentrations of the reactants or products are changed. It only changes with temperature. Therefore, the equilibrium constant for the reaction N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g) will remain the same even after the concentration of H2 is increased to 0.5 M.\n\nHowever, the reaction will shift to re-establish equilibrium after the change in concentration. To determine the new equilibrium concentrations, we can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:\n\n```\n          N2(g)   +   3H2(g)   ⇌   2NH3(g)\nInitial:  0.2 M        0.3 M          0.1 M\nChange:  -x           -3x             +2x\nFinal:   0.2-x         0.5-3x          0.1+2x\n```\n\nAt equilibrium, the reaction will satisfy the equation:\n\nKc = [NH3]^2 / ([N2] * [H2]^3)\n\nSince Kc remains constant, we can use the initial concentrations to find its value:\n\nKc = (0.1)^2 / (0.2 * (0.3)^3)\n\nNow, we can use the final equilibrium concentrations to find the new equilibrium concentrations:\n\nKc = ((0.1+2x)^2) / ((0.2-x) * (0.5-3x)^3)\n\nSince Kc is constant, we can set the two equations equal to each other:\n\n(0.1)^2 / (0.2 * (0.3)^3) = ((0.1+2x)^2) / ((0.2-x) * (0.5-3x)^3)\n\nSolving for x will give us the change in concentrations, and we can find the new equilibrium concentrations. However, the equilibrium constant Kc itself will remain the same."
