    "message_2": "When sodium chloride (NaCl) and silver nitrate (AgNO3) are mixed together, a precipitation reaction occurs, forming silver chloride (AgCl) and sodium nitrate (NaNO3). The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nNaCl (aq) + AgNO3 (aq) â†’ AgCl (s) + NaNO3 (aq)\n\nThe resulting precipitate, silver chloride (AgCl), appears as a white, solid substance."
