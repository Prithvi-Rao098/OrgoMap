    "message_2": "The electronegativity values for chlorine (Cl) and sodium (Na) are 3.16 and 0.93, respectively. To calculate the electronegativity difference between them, we can use the following formula:\n\nElectronegativity difference = |Electronegativity of Cl - Electronegativity of Na|\n\nElectronegativity difference = |3.16 - 0.93| = 2.23\n\nThe electronegativity difference between chlorine and sodium is 2.23. Based on this value, we can determine the type of bond that would form between them. Generally, the bond types are classified as follows:\n\n1. Nonpolar covalent bond: Electronegativity difference < 0.5\n2. Polar covalent bond: Electronegativity difference between 0.5 and 1.7\n3. Ionic bond: Electronegativity difference > 1.7\n\nSince the electronegativity difference between chlorine and sodium is 2.23, which is greater than 1.7, an ionic bond would form between them."
