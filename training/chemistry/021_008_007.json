    "message_2": "The carbonate ion (CO3²-) has three resonance structures. In each resonance structure, the central carbon atom is double-bonded to one oxygen atom and single-bonded to the other two oxygen atoms. The double bond is distributed among the three oxygen atoms, with each oxygen atom having a double bond in one of the resonance structures. The negative charges are distributed among the two oxygen atoms with single bonds.\n\nHere are the three resonance structures:\n\n1. O=C-O(-)-O(-)\n2. O(-)-C=O-O(-)\n3. O(-)-O(-)-C=O\n\nIn these structures, the (-) represents a negative charge on the oxygen atom. The actual structure of the carbonate ion is a hybrid of these three resonance structures, with the double bond and negative charges distributed equally among the three oxygen atoms."
