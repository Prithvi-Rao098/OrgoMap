    "message_2": "When the pH of a solution containing copper (II) ions and ammonia is changed, the equilibrium concentration of the complex ion formed between them is affected. The complex ion formed between copper (II) ions and ammonia is [Cu(NH3)4]^2+. The formation of this complex ion can be represented by the following equilibrium reaction:\n\nCu^2+ (aq) + 4NH3 (aq) ⇌ [Cu(NH3)4]^2+ (aq)\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is given by:\n\nKf = [ [Cu(NH3)4]^2+ ] / ( [Cu^2+] [NH3]^4 )\n\nWhen the pH of the solution is adjusted, the concentration of ammonia (NH3) changes, as ammonia is a weak base that can accept a proton (H+) to form its conjugate acid, ammonium ion (NH4+):\n\nNH3 (aq) + H2O (l) ⇌ NH4+ (aq) + OH- (aq)\n\nAs the pH decreases (becomes more acidic), the concentration of H+ ions increases, causing more ammonia to be converted into ammonium ions. This reduces the concentration of free ammonia in the solution. Since ammonia is a reactant in the formation of the copper-ammonia complex ion, a decrease in its concentration will shift the equilibrium to the left, according to Le Chatelier's principle. This results in a decrease in the concentration of the complex ion, [Cu(NH3)4]^2+.\n\nConversely, as the pH increases (becomes more basic), the concentration of H+ ions decreases, causing less ammonia to be converted into ammonium ions. This increases the concentration of free ammonia in the solution. An increase in ammonia concentration will shift the equilibrium to the right, resulting in an increase in the concentration of the complex ion, [Cu(NH3)4]^2+.\n\nTo calculate the shift in equilibrium, we can use the initial and final concentrations of ammonia and the equilibrium constant (Kf) for the formation of the complex ion. For example, if the initial concentration of ammonia is 0.1 M and the pH is adjusted such that the final concentration of ammonia is 0.05 M, we can calculate the change in the concentration of the complex ion as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the initial concentration of the complex ion using the initial concentration of ammonia and Kf:\n\nInitial [Cu(NH3)4]^2+ = Kf * [Cu^2+] * [NH3]^4\n\n2. Calculate the final concentration of the complex ion using the final concentration of ammonia and Kf:\n\nFinal [Cu(NH3)4]^2+ = Kf * [Cu^2+] * [NH3']^4\n\n3. Calculate the change in the concentration of the complex ion:\n\nΔ[Cu(NH3)4]^2+ = Final [Cu(NH3)4]^2+ - Initial [Cu(NH3)4]^2+\n\nThis calculation will give you the shift in equilibrium concentration of the complex ion when the pH of the solution is adjusted."
