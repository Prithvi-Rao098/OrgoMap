    "message_1": "How much acetic anhydride is required to produce 20 grams of acetylsalicylic acid from 15 grams of salicylic acid in the reaction of acetic anhydride and salicylic acid to form acetylsalicylic acid?",
    "message_2": "To determine the amount of acetic anhydride needed, we first need to know the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nC7H6O3 (salicylic acid) + C4H6O3 (acetic anhydride) → C9H8O4 (acetylsalicylic acid) + C2H4O2 (acetic acid)\n\nNow, we need to find the molar mass of each compound:\n\nSalicylic acid (C7H6O3): (7 × 12.01) + (6 × 1.01) + (3 × 16.00) = 138.12 g/mol\nAcetic anhydride (C4H6O3): (4 × 12.01) + (6 × 1.01) + (3 × 16.00) = 102.09 g/mol\nAcetylsalicylic acid (C9H8O4): (9 × 12.01) + (8 × 1.01) + (4 × 16.00) = 180.16 g/mol\n\nWe are given 15 grams of salicylic acid and want to produce 20 grams of acetylsalicylic acid. First, we need to convert the mass of salicylic acid to moles:\n\n15 g salicylic acid × (1 mol salicylic acid / 138.12 g) = 0.1086 mol salicylic acid\n\nNow, we can use the stoichiometry of the balanced equation to find the moles of acetylsalicylic acid produced:\n\n0.1086 mol salicylic acid × (1 mol acetylsalicylic acid / 1 mol salicylic acid) = 0.1086 mol acetylsalicylic acid\n\nNext, we need to convert the desired mass of acetylsalicylic acid (20 g) to moles:\n\n20 g acetylsalicylic acid × (1 mol acetylsalicylic acid / 180.16 g) = 0.1111 mol acetylsalicylic acid\n\nSince the moles of acetylsalicylic acid produced (0.1086 mol) is less than the desired moles (0.1111 mol), the reaction is limited by the amount of salicylic acid. Therefore, we will use the moles of salicylic acid to find the required moles of acetic anhydride:\n\n0.1086 mol salicylic acid × (1 mol acetic anhydride / 1 mol salicylic acid) = 0.1086 mol acetic anhydride\n\nFinally, we can convert the moles of acetic anhydride to grams:\n\n0.1086 mol acetic anhydride × (102.09 g / 1 mol) = 11.09 g acetic anhydride\n\nSo, you will need approximately 11.09 grams of acetic anhydride to produce 20 grams of acetylsalicylic acid from 15 grams of salicylic acid."
