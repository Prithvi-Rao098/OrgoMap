    "message_2": "To calculate the pH of a solution with a concentration of 0.1 M hydrochloric acid (HCl), we can use the formula:\n\npH = -log10[H+]\n\nHydrochloric acid is a strong acid, meaning it dissociates completely in water to form H+ and Cl- ions. Therefore, the concentration of H+ ions in the solution is equal to the concentration of the HCl, which is 0.1 M.\n\nNow, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\npH = -log10(0.1)\n\npH = 1\n\nSo, the pH of a 0.1 M hydrochloric acid solution is 1."
