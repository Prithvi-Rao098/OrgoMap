    "message_2": "To quantitatively predict the selectivity of a given chemical reaction using quantum chemical calculations, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the reactants, products, and possible transition states: Start by identifying the reactants and products involved in the chemical reaction. Also, consider the possible transition states that may lead to different products. Transition states are high-energy structures that represent the point of maximum energy along the reaction coordinate.\n\n2. Choose an appropriate level of theory: Select an appropriate quantum chemical method to perform the calculations. This choice depends on the size of the system, the desired accuracy, and the available computational resources. Commonly used methods include Hartree-Fock (HF), Density Functional Theory (DFT), and post-Hartree-Fock methods such as Møller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) and Coupled Cluster (CC) theory.\n\n3. Perform geometry optimizations: Optimize the geometries of the reactants, products, and transition states using the chosen level of theory. Geometry optimization involves finding the minimum energy structure for reactants and products, and the saddle point for transition states.\n\n4. Calculate the energies: Calculate the electronic energies of the optimized structures. These energies can be used to determine the relative stabilities of the reactants, products, and transition states.\n\n5. Calculate activation barriers and reaction energies: Determine the activation barriers (ΔE‡) and reaction energies (ΔE) for each reaction pathway by calculating the energy differences between the transition states and the reactants, and between the products and reactants, respectively.\n\n6. Calculate the rate constants: Use transition state theory or other kinetic models to calculate the rate constants (k) for each reaction pathway. The rate constant is related to the activation barrier and temperature.\n\n7. Determine the selectivity: Calculate the selectivity of the reaction by comparing the rate constants of the different reaction pathways. The selectivity is defined as the ratio of the rate constants for the formation of the desired product to the rate constants for the formation of undesired products. A higher selectivity indicates a higher preference for the formation of the desired product.\n\n8. Validate the results: Compare the calculated selectivities with experimental data, if available. This step helps to validate the chosen level of theory and the accuracy of the calculations.\n\nBy following these steps, you can quantitatively predict the selectivity of a given chemical reaction using quantum chemical calculations. Keep in mind that the accuracy of the predictions depends on the chosen level of theory and the quality of the input structures."
