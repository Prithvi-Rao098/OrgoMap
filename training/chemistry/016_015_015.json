Given that the specific heat of water is 4.184 J/g°C and the enthalpy of solution for sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate is -91.1 kJ/mol.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the heat of crystallization for the sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate solution, we need to consider the heat released by the solution and the heat absorbed by the water.\n\nFirst, let's find the moles of sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate in the solution. The molar mass of Na2S2O3∙5H2O is (2 × 23) + (2 × 32) + (3 × 16) + (5 × 18) = 46 + 64 + 48 + 90 = 248 g/mol.\n\n100 g of Na2S2O3∙5H2O / 248 g/mol = 0.403 moles\n\nNow, let's calculate the heat released by the solution during crystallization using the enthalpy of solution:\n\nq_solution = moles × enthalpy of solution\nq_solution = 0.403 moles × -91.1 kJ/mol = -36.7 kJ\n\nNext, we need to calculate the heat absorbed by the water. The mass of water is 500 mL × 1 g/mL = 500 g. The temperature change is ΔT = 10°C - 25°C = -15°C.\n\nq_water = mass × specific heat × ΔT\nq_water = 500 g × 4.184 J/g°C × (-15°C) = -31,380 J = -31.4 kJ\n\nNow, we can find the heat of crystallization by adding the heat released by the solution and the heat absorbed by the water:\n\nq_crystallization = q_solution + q_water\nq_crystallization = -36.7 kJ + (-31.4 kJ) = -68.1 kJ\n\nThe heat of crystallization for the sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate solution is -68.1 kJ."
