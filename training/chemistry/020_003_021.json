    "message_1": "What will be the effect on the equilibrium concentration of products and reactants when the pressure is increased for a reaction that produces more moles of gas molecules than it consumes at equilibrium?",
    "message_2": "When the pressure is increased for a reaction that produces more moles of gas molecules than it consumes at equilibrium, the system will respond by shifting the equilibrium position to counteract the change, according to Le Chatelier's principle. In this case, the equilibrium will shift towards the side with fewer moles of gas molecules, which is the reactant side.\n\nAs a result, the concentration of the products will decrease, and the concentration of the reactants will increase. This shift helps to reduce the pressure by favoring the side with fewer gas molecules."
