    "message_2": "Purines and pyrimidines are two types of nitrogenous bases found in nucleic acids, specifically in DNA and RNA. They are essential components of the genetic code and play a crucial role in the formation of base pairs that hold the two strands of DNA together.\n\nMolecular Structure:\n\n1. Purines: Purines are larger, double-ringed structures consisting of a six-membered pyrimidine ring fused to a five-membered imidazole ring. The two most common purines in DNA are adenine (A) and guanine (G).\n\n2. Pyrimidines: Pyrimidines are smaller, single-ringed structures consisting of a six-membered pyrimidine ring. The three most common pyrimidines in DNA are cytosine (C), thymine (T), and uracil (U). However, uracil is primarily found in RNA, replacing thymine.\n\nImpact on the Genetic Code:\n\n1. Base Pairing: The molecular structure differences between purines and pyrimidines play a significant role in the formation of base pairs in DNA. Adenine (A) forms two hydrogen bonds with thymine (T) in DNA, while guanine (G) forms three hydrogen bonds with cytosine (C). This specific base pairing, known as complementary base pairing, is essential for maintaining the stability of the DNA double helix and ensuring accurate replication and transcription of genetic information.\n\n2. Size Consistency: The pairing of one purine with one pyrimidine maintains a consistent width of the DNA double helix, which is crucial for proper DNA packaging and replication. If two purines or two pyrimidines were to pair together, it would either cause the DNA helix to be too wide or too narrow, leading to instability and potential errors in replication.\n\n3. Genetic Diversity: The differences between purines and pyrimidines contribute to the genetic diversity and complexity of organisms. The specific sequence of base pairs in DNA determines the genetic code, which ultimately directs the synthesis of proteins and other cellular functions. The variation in base pairing allows for a vast array of possible combinations, enabling the storage of complex genetic information.\n\nIn summary, the molecular structure differences between purines and pyrimidines are crucial for maintaining the stability of the DNA double helix, ensuring accurate replication and transcription of genetic information, and contributing to genetic diversity."
