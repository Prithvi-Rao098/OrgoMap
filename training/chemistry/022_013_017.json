    "message_2": "To determine the oxidation state of the carbon atoms in the molecule C2H5OH (ethanol), we need to assign oxidation states to each atom in the molecule. \n\n1. Hydrogen has an oxidation state of +1.\n2. Oxygen has an oxidation state of -2.\n\nThe molecule C2H5OH can be written as CH3CH2OH. Let's break it down into three parts: CH3, CH2, and OH.\n\nFor the CH3 group:\nC + 3(H) = 0\nC + 3(+1) = 0\nC = -3\n\nFor the CH2 group:\nC + 2(H) = 0\nC + 2(+1) = 0\nC = -2\n\nFor the OH group:\nO + H = 0\n(-2) + (+1) = 0\n\nNow, let's put the molecule back together: CH3CH2OH\nThe oxidation state of the first carbon (in CH3) is -3, and the oxidation state of the second carbon (in CH2) is -2."
