    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the formation of ethylene glycol (C2H6O2) from its elements, we need to consider the balanced chemical equation for the formation reaction:\n\n2 C (s) + 3 H2 (g) + O2 (g) → C2H6O2 (l)\n\nNow, we can use Hess's Law, which states that the enthalpy change for a reaction is the same whether it occurs in one step or several steps. We can break down the formation of ethylene glycol into two steps:\n\nStep 1: Formation of CO2 and H2O from their elements\nC (s) + O2 (g) → CO2 (g) ΔHf = -393.5 kJ/mol\n2 H2 (g) + O2 (g) → 2 H2O (l) ΔHf = 2 * (-285.8 kJ/mol) = -571.6 kJ/mol\n\nStep 2: Formation of ethylene glycol from CO2 and H2O\nCO2 (g) + 2 H2O (l) → C2H6O2 (l) ΔHf = -421.1 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can use Hess's Law to find the enthalpy change for the formation of ethylene glycol from its elements:\n\nΔHf (C2H6O2) = ΔHf (CO2) + ΔHf (2 H2O) - ΔHf (C2H6O2)\nΔHf (C2H6O2) = (-393.5 kJ/mol) + (-571.6 kJ/mol) - (-421.1 kJ/mol)\n\nΔHf (C2H6O2) = -543.0 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the formation of ethylene glycol from its elements is -543.0 kJ/mol."
