    "message_1": "One possible question for a chemistry student on single replacement reactions could be: \"If a piece of copper metal is placed in a solution of silver nitrate, what is the balanced chemical equation for the reaction that occurs, and what are the products formed?\"",
    "message_2": "In a single replacement reaction, one element replaces another element in a compound. In this case, copper (Cu) will replace silver (Ag) in silver nitrate (AgNO3) solution.\n\nThe unbalanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nCu + AgNO3 → Cu(NO3)2 + Ag\n\nTo balance the equation, we need to ensure that the number of atoms for each element is the same on both sides of the equation. In this case, we need to balance the number of silver and nitrate ions:\n\nCu + 2AgNO3 → Cu(NO3)2 + 2Ag\n\nNow the equation is balanced. The products formed in this reaction are copper(II) nitrate (Cu(NO3)2) and silver metal (Ag)."
