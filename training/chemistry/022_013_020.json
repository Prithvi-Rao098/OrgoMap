    "message_2": "In the HClO4 (perchloric acid) molecule, the oxidation state of chlorine is +7.\n\nTo determine this, we can assign oxidation numbers to each atom in the molecule:\n\n1. Hydrogen (H) usually has an oxidation state of +1.\n2. Oxygen (O) usually has an oxidation state of -2.\n3. The sum of the oxidation states in a neutral molecule must equal the overall charge of the molecule, which is 0 in this case.\n\nUsing these rules, we can set up an equation:\n\n(+1) + Cl + 4(-2) = 0\n\nSolving for the oxidation state of chlorine (Cl):\n\n1 - 8 + Cl = 0\nCl = 7\n\nSo, the oxidation state of chlorine in HClO4 is +7."
