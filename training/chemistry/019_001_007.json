    "message_2": "The combustion of methane (CH4) can be represented by the following balanced chemical equation:\n\nCH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(l)\n\nThe standard enthalpy change of combustion for one mole of methane (ΔH°c) is -890.3 kJ/mol.\n\nTo find the enthalpy change for the combustion of 2 moles of methane, simply multiply the standard enthalpy change of combustion for one mole by the number of moles:\n\nΔH = (ΔH°c) × (number of moles)\n\nΔH = (-890.3 kJ/mol) × (2 mol)\n\nΔH = -1780.6 kJ\n\nSo, the enthalpy change for the combustion of 2 moles of methane at standard conditions is -1780.6 kJ."
