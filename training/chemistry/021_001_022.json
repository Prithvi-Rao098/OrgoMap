    "message_2": "A lithium atom (Li) and a fluorine atom (F) will form an ionic bond. This is because lithium is a metal and fluorine is a non-metal. In an ionic bond, the metal (lithium) loses an electron to become a positively charged ion (Li+), while the non-metal (fluorine) gains an electron to become a negatively charged ion (F-). The electrostatic attraction between these oppositely charged ions results in the formation of an ionic bond."
