    "message_1": "A sample of an unknown element has been found in a research laboratory. The element has two stable isotopes with masses of 117 and 119. The percentage abundance of the isotopes in the sample is unknown. Determine the isotopic notation of the element and calculate the average atomic mass of the element.",
    "message_2": "To determine the isotopic notation of the element, we need to know the atomic number (Z) of the element, which is not provided in the problem. However, we can still represent the isotopes in a general form:\n\nIsotope 1: X-117 (where X is the unknown element symbol and 117 is the mass number)\nIsotope 2: X-119 (where X is the unknown element symbol and 119 is the mass number)\n\nTo calculate the average atomic mass of the element, we need the percentage abundance of each isotope. Since this information is not provided, we can represent the average atomic mass using variables:\n\nLet p1 be the percentage abundance of X-117 (in decimal form, so 0.5 for 50%)\nLet p2 be the percentage abundance of X-119 (in decimal form, so 0.5 for 50%)\n\nThe sum of the percentage abundances should equal 1 (100%):\np1 + p2 = 1\n\nThe average atomic mass (AAM) can be calculated using the following formula:\nAAM = (mass of isotope 1 × percentage abundance of isotope 1) + (mass of isotope 2 × percentage abundance of isotope 2)\n\nAAM = (117 × p1) + (119 × p2)\n\nWithout the percentage abundance values, we cannot calculate the exact average atomic mass. However, the general formula above can be used once the percentage abundances are known."
