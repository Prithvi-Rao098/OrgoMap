    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction, we first need to write the expression for Kc. For the given reaction:\n\n2NO(g) + O2(g) ⇌ 2NO2(g)\n\nThe Kc expression is:\n\nKc = [NO2]^2 / ([NO]^2 * [O2])\n\nNow, we are given the equilibrium concentrations of the reactants and products:\n\n[NO] = 0.50 M\n[O2] = 0.25 M\n[NO2] = 0.20 M\n\nPlug these values into the Kc expression:\n\nKc = (0.20)^2 / ((0.50)^2 * (0.25))\n\nKc = 0.04 / (0.25 * 0.25)\n\nKc = 0.04 / 0.0625\n\nKc ≈ 0.64\n\nThe equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction at 298 K is approximately 0.64."
