    "message_2": "To calculate the reaction quotient (Q) for the given reaction, we'll use the following formula:\n\nQ = [NO₃]^2 / ([NO₂]^2 × [O₂])\n\nWe are given the initial concentrations of the reactants and products:\n\n[NO₂] = 0.50 M\n[O₂] = 0.20 M\n[NO₃] = 0.00 M\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nQ = (0.00)^2 / ((0.50)^2 × (0.20))\n\nQ = 0 / (0.25 × 0.20)\n\nQ = 0 / 0.05\n\nQ = 0\n\nSo, the reaction quotient (Q) for the given reaction with the initial concentrations is 0."
