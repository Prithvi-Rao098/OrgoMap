    "message_2": "The presence of a ligand in coordination complexes affects the crystal field splitting energy (Δ) by altering the energy levels of the d-orbitals in the central metal ion. This is due to the interaction between the ligands and the metal ion, which creates an electric field around the metal ion. The crystal field splitting energy is a measure of the energy difference between the d-orbitals in the presence of the ligand field.\n\nLigands can be classified as strong-field or weak-field ligands, based on their ability to cause crystal field splitting. Strong-field ligands, such as cyanide (CN-) and carbon monoxide (CO), cause a larger splitting of the d-orbitals, resulting in a higher crystal field splitting energy. On the other hand, weak-field ligands, such as iodide (I-) and bromide (Br-), cause a smaller splitting of the d-orbitals, resulting in a lower crystal field splitting energy.\n\nThe strength of the ligand field also depends on the geometry of the coordination complex. For example, in an octahedral complex, the d-orbitals are split into two groups: the lower-energy t2g orbitals (dxy, dyz, and dxz) and the higher-energy eg orbitals (dx^2-y^2 and dz^2). The crystal field splitting energy (Δo) in an octahedral complex is larger than that in a tetrahedral complex (Δt) due to the difference in the arrangement of the ligands around the central metal ion.\n\nIn summary, the presence of a ligand in coordination complexes affects the crystal field splitting energy by altering the energy levels of the d-orbitals in the central metal ion. The strength of the ligand field and the geometry of the coordination complex determine the magnitude of the crystal field splitting energy."
