    "message_2": "To calculate the formal charge on the oxygen atom in the sulfate ion (SO₄²⁻), we can use the following formula:\n\nFormal charge = (Valence electrons of the atom) - (Non-bonding electrons) - 1/2(Bonding electrons)\n\nIn the sulfate ion, the sulfur atom is bonded to four oxygen atoms through double bonds. Each oxygen atom forms a double bond with the sulfur atom.\n\nFor oxygen:\n1. Valence electrons of oxygen = 6 (as it is in group 16 of the periodic table)\n2. Non-bonding electrons = 4 (as there are two lone pairs on each oxygen atom)\n3. Bonding electrons = 4 (as there are two bonds formed, and each bond has 2 electrons)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nFormal charge = 6 - 4 - 1/2(4)\nFormal charge = 6 - 4 - 2\nFormal charge = 0\n\nHowever, this is the formal charge of one oxygen atom in the sulfate ion. Since the overall charge of the sulfate ion is -2, and there are four oxygen atoms, the total negative charge is distributed among the four oxygen atoms. Therefore, each oxygen atom has a formal charge of -1/2. But, formal charges are always whole numbers, so two of the oxygen atoms will have a formal charge of -1, and the other two will have a formal charge of 0.\n\nSo, the formal charge on an oxygen atom in the sulfate ion (SO₄²⁻) can be either -1 or 0, depending on which oxygen atom you are considering."
