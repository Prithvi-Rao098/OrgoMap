    "message_2": "The balanced chemical equation for the preparation of 2,4-dinitrophenol from phenol and nitric acid is:\n\nC6H5OH + 2 HNO3 → C6H3(NO2)2OH + 2 H2O\n\nTo calculate the mass of nitric acid required to produce 25 grams of 2,4-dinitrophenol with a 90% yield, we first need to determine the theoretical yield and then the actual yield.\n\n1. Calculate the molar mass of 2,4-dinitrophenol (C6H3(NO2)2OH):\nMolar mass = (6 × 12.01) + (3 × 1.01) + (2 × (14.01 + 2 × 16.00)) + (1.01 + 16.00)\nMolar mass = 184.11 g/mol\n\n2. Calculate the moles of 2,4-dinitrophenol needed for 25 grams:\nmoles = mass / molar mass\nmoles = 25 g / 184.11 g/mol\nmoles = 0.1358 mol\n\n3. Calculate the theoretical yield:\nTheoretical yield = moles of 2,4-dinitrophenol / moles of nitric acid\nSince the balanced equation shows a 1:2 ratio between phenol and nitric acid, we need twice the moles of nitric acid:\nmoles of nitric acid = 0.1358 mol × 2\nmoles of nitric acid = 0.2716 mol\n\n4. Calculate the actual yield (90%):\nActual yield = theoretical yield × 0.90\nActual yield = 0.2716 mol × 0.90\nActual yield = 0.2444 mol\n\n5. Calculate the mass of nitric acid required (HNO3 molar mass = 63.01 g/mol):\nmass = moles × molar mass\nmass = 0.2444 mol × 63.01 g/mol\nmass = 15.39 g\n\nTherefore, 15.39 grams of nitric acid are required to produce 25 grams of 2,4-dinitrophenol with a 90% yield."
