    "message_2": "The dehydration of 2-methyl-2-butanol using concentrated sulfuric acid follows an E1 (Elimination Unimolecular) mechanism. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction:\n\n1. Protonation: The hydroxyl group (-OH) of 2-methyl-2-butanol acts as a nucleophile and attacks a proton (H+) from the concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4). This results in the formation of a good leaving group, water (H2O), and a carbocation intermediate.\n\n2. Carbocation formation: The water molecule leaves, generating a carbocation at the tertiary carbon (the carbon attached to three other carbons) of the 2-methyl-2-butanol molecule. This carbocation is relatively stable due to the inductive effect and hyperconjugation from the three alkyl groups attached to the positively charged carbon.\n\n3. Elimination: A base (HSO4-) from the sulfuric acid abstracts a proton (H+) from one of the adjacent carbons to the carbocation, forming a double bond between the carbocation carbon and the adjacent carbon. This step results in the formation of an alkene.\n\nThe major product formed in this reaction is 2-methyl-2-butene. Since the reaction follows Zaitsev's rule, the more substituted alkene is the major product. In this case, the double bond is formed between the tertiary and secondary carbons, resulting in a more substituted and stable alkene."
