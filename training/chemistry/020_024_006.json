    "message_1": "What is the effect of adding a catalyst on the equilibrium position of a redox reaction where iodate ions combine with sulfite ions in an acidic solution to create iodide ions and sulfate ions? Calculate the new equilibrium constant with and without the catalyst given the reaction equation: \n\nIO3^- (aq) + 3SO3^2- (aq) + H2O (l) â†’ I^- (aq) + 3SO4^2- (aq) + 2H+ (aq) \n\nAssume the temperature, pressure and volume remain constant, and that the initial concentrations of each reactant and product are known.",
    "message_2": "Adding a catalyst to a chemical reaction does not affect the equilibrium position or the equilibrium constant of the reaction. A catalyst works by lowering the activation energy of the reaction, which increases the reaction rate for both the forward and reverse reactions. However, since the catalyst affects both the forward and reverse reactions equally, the equilibrium position remains unchanged.\n\nTo calculate the equilibrium constant (K) for the given reaction, we use the expression:\n\nK = [I^-][SO4^2-]^3[H+]^2 / ([IO3^-][SO3^2-]^3)\n\nSince the catalyst does not affect the equilibrium constant, the K value will be the same with or without the catalyst. To calculate the K value, you would need the initial concentrations of each reactant and product, which are not provided in this case."
