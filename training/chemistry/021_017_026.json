    "message_2": "The strongest intermolecular forces present in a sample of water are hydrogen bonds. These occur between the partially positive hydrogen atoms of one water molecule and the partially negative oxygen atoms of another water molecule. Hydrogen bonding is a type of dipole-dipole interaction, but it is stronger than typical dipole-dipole interactions due to the highly polar nature of the O-H bond in water molecules."
