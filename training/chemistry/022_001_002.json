    "message_2": "To balance the chemical equation H2 + O2 -> H2O, we need to make sure that the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of the equation.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation is: 2H2 + O2 -> 2H2O\n\nThis means that 2 molecules of hydrogen (H2) react with 1 molecule of oxygen (O2) to produce 2 molecules of water (H2O)."
