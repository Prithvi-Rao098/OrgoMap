    "message_2": "To determine the maximum electrical work that can be obtained from the reaction between zinc and copper ions in a galvanic cell, we need to calculate the cell potential (E°cell) and use the formula for the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) under standard conditions:\n\nΔG° = -nFE°cell\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the reaction, F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol), and E°cell is the standard cell potential.\n\nThe half-reactions for the zinc-copper galvanic cell are as follows:\n\nZn(s) → Zn²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ (anode, oxidation)\nE°(Zn²⁺/Zn) = -0.76 V\n\nCu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Cu(s) (cathode, reduction)\nE°(Cu²⁺/Cu) = +0.34 V\n\nTo calculate the standard cell potential (E°cell), we subtract the anode potential from the cathode potential:\n\nE°cell = E°(Cu²⁺/Cu) - E°(Zn²⁺/Zn) = 0.34 V - (-0.76 V) = 1.10 V\n\nSince the balanced redox reaction involves the transfer of 2 moles of electrons (2e⁻), we can now calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°):\n\nΔG° = -nFE°cell = -(2 mol)(96,485 C/mol)(1.10 V) = -212,667 J/mol\n\nThe maximum electrical work that can be obtained from the reaction is equal to the negative Gibbs free energy change:\n\nWmax = -ΔG° = 212,667 J/mol\n\nSo, the maximum electrical work that can be obtained from the reaction between zinc and copper ions in a galvanic cell under standard conditions is 212,667 J/mol."
