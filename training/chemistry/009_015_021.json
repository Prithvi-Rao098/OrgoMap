    "message_2": "Neutron activation analysis (NAA) is a technique used to determine the concentration of elements in a sample by irradiating the sample with neutrons and measuring the gamma rays emitted during the radioactive decay of the activated elements.\n\nTo determine the concentration of gold in the sample, we can use the following formula:\n\nConcentration = (Gamma rays per second) / (Gamma-ray intensity of gold)\n\nGiven the sample produces 35 gamma rays per second and the gamma-ray intensity of gold is 0.609, we can calculate the concentration as follows:\n\nConcentration = 35 / 0.609\nConcentration â‰ˆ 57.46\n\nTherefore, the concentration of gold in the sample is approximately 57.46 ppm (parts per million)."
