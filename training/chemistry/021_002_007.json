    "message_2": "To calculate the bond length between two hydrogen atoms that are covalently bonded together, we need to first find the covalent radius (𝑟∘) of hydrogen. The covalent radius of hydrogen is approximately 31 pm (picometers).\n\nNow, we can use the given formula to calculate the bond length (𝑟):\n\n𝑟 = 0.74(𝑟∘ + 𝑟∘)\n\nSince both atoms are hydrogen, their covalent radii are the same:\n\n𝑟 = 0.74(31 pm + 31 pm)\n\n𝑟 = 0.74(62 pm)\n\n𝑟 ≈ 45.88 pm\n\nSo, the bond length between two hydrogen atoms that are covalently bonded together is approximately 45.88 pm."
