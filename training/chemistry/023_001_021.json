    "message_2": "To calculate the percentage yield of aspirin, we first need to determine the theoretical yield of aspirin based on the limiting reactant, which in this case is salicylic acid.\n\n1. Write the balanced chemical equation for the synthesis of aspirin:\nC7H6O3 (salicylic acid) + C4H6O3 (acetic anhydride) → C9H8O4 (aspirin) + C2H4O2 (acetic acid)\n\n2. Calculate the molar mass of salicylic acid and aspirin:\nSalicylic acid: C7H6O3 = (7 × 12.01) + (6 × 1.01) + (3 × 16.00) = 138.12 g/mol\nAspirin: C9H8O4 = (9 × 12.01) + (8 × 1.01) + (4 × 16.00) = 180.16 g/mol\n\n3. Calculate the moles of salicylic acid:\nmoles = mass / molar mass = 5 g / 138.12 g/mol = 0.0362 mol\n\n4. Determine the theoretical yield of aspirin:\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, the moles of aspirin produced will be the same as the moles of salicylic acid used.\nmass of aspirin = moles × molar mass = 0.0362 mol × 180.16 g/mol = 6.52 g (theoretical yield)\n\nNow, we need the actual yield of aspirin obtained from the experiment. The actual yield is the amount of aspirin produced in the experiment, which is usually less than the theoretical yield due to side reactions, incomplete reactions, or loss during purification.\n\nAssuming you have the actual yield value, you can calculate the percentage yield using the following formula:\n\nPercentage yield = (actual yield / theoretical yield) × 100\n\nIf you don't have the actual yield value, you cannot calculate the percentage yield."
