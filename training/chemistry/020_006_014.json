    "message_2": "To find the new equilibrium constant (K) for the reaction at different temperatures, we can use the Van't Hoff equation:\n\nln(K2/K1) = -ΔH°/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere K1 and K2 are the equilibrium constants at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively, ΔH° is the standard enthalpy change, and R is the gas constant (8.314 J/K/mol).\n\nFirst, we need to find the initial equilibrium constant (K1) at 300 K. We can use the Gibbs free energy equation:\n\nΔG° = -RT * ln(K1)\nΔG° = ΔH° - T * ΔS°\n\nCombining the two equations, we get:\n\n-RT * ln(K1) = ΔH° - T * ΔS°\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values for ΔH°, ΔS°, and T:\n\n- (8.314 J/K/mol) * (300 K) * ln(K1) = -198200 J/mol - (300 K) * (-187.7 J/K/mol)\n\nSolving for K1:\n\nln(K1) = (198200 J/mol + 300 K * 187.7 J/K/mol) / (8.314 J/K/mol * 300 K)\nln(K1) ≈ 9.07\n\nK1 ≈ e^9.07 ≈ 8670\n\nNow we can use the Van't Hoff equation to find K2 at 350 K:\n\nln(K2/8670) = -(-198200 J/mol) / (8.314 J/K/mol) * (1/350 K - 1/300 K)\n\nSolving for K2:\n\nln(K2) ≈ 9.07 + 198200 J/mol / (8.314 J/K/mol) * (1/350 K - 1/300 K)\nln(K2) ≈ 10.42\n\nK2 ≈ e^10.42 ≈ 33500\n\nSo, the new equilibrium constants for the reaction at 300 K and 350 K are approximately 8670 and 33500, respectively."
