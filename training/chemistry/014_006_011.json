    "message_2": "The coordination number for the complex [Co(Cl)(NH3)5]2+ is 6. This is because there are 5 NH3 ligands and 1 Cl ligand surrounding the central Co ion, making a total of 6 ligands.\n\nThe geometry for this complex is octahedral. In an octahedral geometry, the six ligands are arranged around the central metal ion at equal distances and angles of 90Â° between any two adjacent ligands."
