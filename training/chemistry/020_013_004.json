    "message_1": "What is the equilibrium constant expression for the following reaction between the weak acid acetic acid (CH3COOH) and water (H2O)?\n\nCH3COOH + H2O ⇌ H3O+ + CH3COO- \n\nCalculate the equilibrium constant (Ka) for the above reaction if the pH of a solution containing 0.1 M acetic acid is found to be 4.76.",
    "message_2": "The equilibrium constant expression for the reaction between acetic acid and water is given by the formula:\n\nKa = [H3O+][CH3COO-] / [CH3COOH]\n\nGiven that the pH of the solution is 4.76, we can calculate the concentration of H3O+ ions using the formula:\n\npH = -log10[H3O+]\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for [H3O+]:\n\n[H3O+] = 10^(-pH)\n\n[H3O+] = 10^(-4.76) = 1.74 × 10^(-5) M\n\nSince acetic acid is a weak acid, we can assume that the concentration of CH3COO- ions is equal to the concentration of H3O+ ions:\n\n[CH3COO-] = 1.74 × 10^(-5) M\n\nInitially, the concentration of acetic acid (CH3COOH) is 0.1 M. After the reaction, the concentration of CH3COOH will decrease by the same amount as the concentration of H3O+ ions:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.1 - 1.74 × 10^(-5) ≈ 0.1 M\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Ka expression:\n\nKa = (1.74 × 10^(-5))(1.74 × 10^(-5)) / 0.1\n\nKa = 3.03 × 10^(-10)\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (Ka) for the reaction between acetic acid and water is approximately 3.03 × 10^(-10)."
