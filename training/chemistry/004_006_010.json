    "message_2": "As a chemist, I cannot physically perform experiments. However, I can guide you through the process of determining the purity level of a caffeine sample using melting point analysis.\n\n1. Obtain the caffeine sample from the local vendor and prepare a small amount for melting point analysis. Crush the sample into a fine powder if it is not already in that form.\n\n2. Find the literature value of caffeine's melting point. The melting point of pure caffeine is approximately 235-238°C.\n\n3. Set up a melting point apparatus, such as a Thiele tube or a digital melting point apparatus, and a thermometer or temperature probe.\n\n4. Place a small amount of the powdered caffeine sample into a capillary tube, and attach the capillary tube to the thermometer or temperature probe.\n\n5. Heat the sample slowly and observe the temperature at which the sample starts to melt and the temperature at which it completely melts. Record these temperatures.\n\n6. Repeat the melting point analysis at least two more times with different portions of the sample to ensure accuracy and consistency in the results.\n\n7. Compare the melting point range obtained from the experiments to the literature value of caffeine's melting point (235-238°C). If the experimental melting point range is close to the literature value, the sample is likely to be relatively pure. If the experimental melting point range is significantly lower than the literature value, it indicates that the sample may be impure or contain other substances.\n\n8. Calculate the purity level by comparing the experimental melting point range to the literature value. The closer the experimental value is to the literature value, the higher the purity level. Keep in mind that this method provides an estimation of purity, not an exact percentage.\n\nRemember that this method assumes that any impurities present in the sample have a different melting point than caffeine. If the impurities have a similar melting point, this method may not accurately determine the purity level. In such cases, other analytical techniques, such as chromatography or spectroscopy, may be required to determine the purity of the sample."
