    "message_2": "To calculate the molar mass of Calcium Carbonate (CaCO₃), we need to find the molar mass of each element present in the compound and then add them together.\n\nCalcium (Ca): 1 atom × 40.08 g/mol (molar mass of Ca) = 40.08 g/mol\nCarbon (C): 1 atom × 12.01 g/mol (molar mass of C) = 12.01 g/mol\nOxygen (O): 3 atoms × 16.00 g/mol (molar mass of O) = 48.00 g/mol\n\nNow, add the molar masses of each element together:\n\nMolar mass of CaCO₃ = 40.08 g/mol (Ca) + 12.01 g/mol (C) + 48.00 g/mol (O) = 100.09 g/mol\n\nSo, the molar mass of Calcium Carbonate (CaCO₃) is 100.09 g/mol."
