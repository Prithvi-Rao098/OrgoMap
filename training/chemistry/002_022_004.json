    "message_2": "To calculate the lattice energy of magnesium oxide (MgO), we can use the Born-Haber cycle, which relates the lattice energy to the ionization energy of the metal, the electron affinity of the nonmetal, and the formation enthalpy of the compound.\n\nThe lattice energy (U) can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nU = ΔHf - (IE + EA)\n\nWhere:\n- ΔHf is the enthalpy of formation of MgO\n- IE is the ionization energy of Mg (3944 kJ/mol)\n- EA is the electron affinity of O (751 kJ/mol)\n\nFirst, we need to find the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) of MgO. The standard enthalpy of formation of MgO is -601.6 kJ/mol.\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the equation:\n\nU = (-601.6 kJ/mol) - (3944 kJ/mol + 751 kJ/mol)\nU = -601.6 kJ/mol - 4695 kJ/mol\nU = -5296.6 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the lattice energy of magnesium oxide (MgO) is approximately -5296.6 kJ/mol."
