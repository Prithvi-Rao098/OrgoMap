    "message_2": "An unstable nucleus with atomic number 84 and mass number 210 is an isotope of polonium, specifically Po-210. To determine its nuclear stability and possible decay modes, we can analyze its neutron-to-proton (N/Z) ratio and consult the radioactive decay series.\n\nThe N/Z ratio for Po-210 can be calculated as follows:\n\nNumber of neutrons (N) = Mass number (A) - Atomic number (Z)\nN = 210 - 84 = 126\n\nN/Z ratio = 126/84 ≈ 1.5\n\nFor lighter elements (atomic number below 20), a stable N/Z ratio is typically around 1. For heavier elements, the stable N/Z ratio tends to increase slightly due to the repulsive forces between protons. However, an N/Z ratio of 1.5 is still relatively high for an element with an atomic number of 84, indicating that Po-210 is likely to be unstable.\n\nPolonium-210 is part of the uranium-238 decay series, and its primary decay mode is alpha decay. In alpha decay, the nucleus emits an alpha particle, which consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This results in a decrease of both the atomic number and mass number:\n\nPo-210 (84 protons, 126 neutrons) → Pb-206 (82 protons, 124 neutrons) + α (2 protons, 2 neutrons)\n\nIn this decay process, Po-210 transforms into lead-206 (Pb-206), which is a stable isotope. The half-life of Po-210 is approximately 138.4 days, indicating that it is highly radioactive.\n\nIn summary, Po-210 is an unstable nucleus with a high N/Z ratio. Its primary decay mode is alpha decay, which leads to the formation of the stable isotope Pb-206."
