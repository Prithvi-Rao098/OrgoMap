    "message_2": "The addition of titanium to nickel-based superalloys significantly improves their mechanical properties, making them suitable for high-temperature aerospace applications. Titanium enhances the performance of these superalloys in several ways:\n\n1. Strengthening effect: Titanium forms coherent precipitates with aluminum, known as gamma-prime (γ') phase, which have a significant strengthening effect on the alloy. The γ' phase is a major contributor to the high-temperature strength of nickel-based superalloys, as it provides resistance to deformation and creep at elevated temperatures.\n\n2. Grain refinement: The addition of titanium promotes grain refinement in nickel-based superalloys. Fine-grained microstructures are desirable in high-temperature applications, as they provide improved mechanical properties, such as increased strength, toughness, and fatigue resistance.\n\n3. Oxidation resistance: Titanium enhances the oxidation resistance of nickel-based superalloys by forming a protective oxide layer on the surface of the alloy. This layer prevents further oxidation and degradation of the material, which is crucial for high-temperature applications where materials are exposed to aggressive environments.\n\n4. Improved creep resistance: Creep is the slow deformation of a material under constant stress at high temperatures. Titanium improves the creep resistance of nickel-based superalloys by stabilizing the γ' phase and promoting the formation of a fine-grained microstructure. This results in a material that can maintain its strength and resist deformation at elevated temperatures for extended periods.\n\n5. Enhanced fatigue resistance: The addition of titanium improves the fatigue resistance of nickel-based superalloys by promoting the formation of a fine-grained microstructure and strengthening the material through the γ' phase. This allows the alloy to withstand cyclic loading and resist crack propagation, which is essential for aerospace applications where materials are subjected to repeated stress cycles.\n\nIn summary, the addition of titanium to nickel-based superalloys significantly improves their mechanical properties, making them suitable for high-temperature aerospace applications. The enhanced strength, oxidation resistance, creep resistance, and fatigue resistance provided by titanium make these superalloys ideal for use in demanding environments, such as jet engines and gas turbines."
