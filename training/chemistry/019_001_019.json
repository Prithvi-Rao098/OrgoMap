    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of propane (C3H8), we need to consider the balanced chemical equation for the combustion reaction and the standard enthalpies of formation for each compound involved.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the combustion of propane is:\n\nC3H8(g) + 5O2(g) → 3CO2(g) + 4H2O(l)\n\nNow, we need the standard enthalpies of formation (∆Hf°) for each compound:\n\n∆Hf° [C3H8(g)] = -103.85 kJ/mol\n∆Hf° [O2(g)] = 0 kJ/mol (since it is in its standard state)\n∆Hf° [CO2(g)] = -393.5 kJ/mol\n∆Hf° [H2O(l)] = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nUsing the formula for enthalpy change:\n\n∆H = Σn∆Hf°(products) - Σn∆Hf°(reactants)\n\n∆H = [3(-393.5) + 4(-285.8)] - [(-103.85) + 5(0)]\n\n∆H = (-1180.5 - 1143.2) - (-103.85)\n\n∆H = -2323.7 + 103.85\n\n∆H ≈ -2219.85 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change for the combustion of propane is approximately -2219.85 kJ/mol. This value is negative, indicating that the reaction is exothermic (releases heat)."
