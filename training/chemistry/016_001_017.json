    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy of formation of methanol, we can use the following combustion reaction:\n\nCH3OH (l) + 3/2 O2 (g) → CO2 (g) + 2 H2O (l)\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for this reaction (ΔH_comb) is -726.4 kJ/mol.\n\nWe can also express the standard enthalpy change for this reaction in terms of the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔH_f) of the reactants and products:\n\nΔH_comb = [ΔH_f(CO2) + 2ΔH_f(H2O)] - [ΔH_f(CH3OH) + 3/2ΔH_f(O2)]\n\nSince the standard enthalpy of formation of an element in its standard state is zero, ΔH_f(O2) = 0. We can now plug in the given values for the standard enthalpies of formation of CO2 and H2O:\n\n-726.4 kJ/mol = [(-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2(-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [ΔH_f(CH3OH)]\n\nNow, we can solve for ΔH_f(CH3OH):\n\n-726.4 kJ/mol = (-393.5 kJ/mol - 571.6 kJ/mol) - ΔH_f(CH3OH)\n-726.4 kJ/mol = -965.1 kJ/mol - ΔH_f(CH3OH)\n\nAdding 965.1 kJ/mol to both sides:\n\nΔH_f(CH3OH) = 238.7 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy of formation of methanol, CH3OH (l), is 238.7 kJ/mol."
