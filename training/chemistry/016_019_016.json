The initial and final volumes of the gas are 10.0 L and 8.00 L respectively, and the heat capacity of the system is 25 J/K.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the adsorption of methane gas on the zeolite catalyst, we need to consider both the work done on the system due to the change in volume and the heat absorbed or released due to the change in temperature.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the work done on the system due to the change in volume. The work done (W) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nW = -P_ext * ΔV\n\nwhere P_ext is the external pressure and ΔV is the change in volume. Since the pressure is not constant, we will use the average pressure during the process:\n\nP_avg = (P_initial + P_final) / 2\nP_avg = (100 atm + 75 atm) / 2\nP_avg = 87.5 atm\n\nNow, we need to convert the pressure to the SI unit (Pascals) and the volume to the SI unit (cubic meters):\n\nP_avg = 87.5 atm * 101325 Pa/atm = 8865375 Pa\n\nV_initial = 10.0 L * (1 m³ / 1000 L) = 0.01 m³\nV_final = 8.00 L * (1 m³ / 1000 L) = 0.008 m³\n\nΔV = V_final - V_initial = 0.008 m³ - 0.01 m³ = -0.002 m³\n\nNow, we can calculate the work done:\n\nW = -P_avg * ΔV = -(-0.002 m³ * 8865375 Pa) = 17730.75 J\n\nNext, let's calculate the heat absorbed or released due to the change in temperature. The heat (q) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nq = C_p * ΔT\n\nwhere C_p is the heat capacity of the system and ΔT is the change in temperature:\n\nΔT = T_final - T_initial = 288 K - 298 K = -10 K\n\nq = 25 J/K * (-10 K) = -250 J\n\nFinally, we can calculate the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the adsorption process:\n\nΔH = q + W = -250 J + 17730.75 J = 17480.75 J\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy change for the adsorption of 2.50 moles of methane gas on a zeolite catalyst supported by alumina is 17480.75 J."
