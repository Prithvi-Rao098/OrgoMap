    "message_1": "What would be the predicted boiling point of a substance with predominantly London dispersion forces compared to a substance with predominantly hydrogen bonding, given that both substances have similar molecular weights?",
    "message_2": "A substance with predominantly hydrogen bonding would have a higher boiling point compared to a substance with predominantly London dispersion forces, even if both substances have similar molecular weights.\n\nThis is because hydrogen bonding is a stronger intermolecular force than London dispersion forces. Stronger intermolecular forces require more energy to overcome, resulting in a higher boiling point for the substance with hydrogen bonding. In contrast, London dispersion forces are weaker and require less energy to overcome, leading to a lower boiling point for the substance with predominantly London dispersion forces."
