    "message_1": "What is the structure of compound X, based on the information obtained from its nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum?",
    "message_2": "To determine the structure of compound X, I would need specific information from its nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum, such as the number of signals, their chemical shifts, coupling constants, and multiplicities. Additionally, knowing the molecular formula of the compound would be helpful.\n\nPlease provide the necessary information from the NMR spectrum and the molecular formula, if available, so I can help you determine the structure of compound X."
