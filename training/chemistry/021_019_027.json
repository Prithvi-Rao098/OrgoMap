    "message_2": "The solubility product constant (Ksp) is used to determine the solubility of a sparingly soluble salt in water. However, the Ksp value provided (36) is incorrect for sodium chloride (NaCl). NaCl is a highly soluble salt, and its solubility does not depend on the Ksp value. Instead, we can use the known solubility value for NaCl in water at 25째C.\n\nThe solubility of sodium chloride (NaCl) in water at 25째C is approximately 357 g/L. This means that 357 grams of NaCl can dissolve in 1 liter of water at 25째C."
