    "message_2": "To find the concentration of iron (II) ion in the sample, we can use the Beer-Lambert Law, which states:\n\nA = ε * c * l\n\nwhere A is the absorbance, ε is the molar absorption coefficient, c is the concentration, and l is the path length (usually in cm).\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nA = 0.294\nε = 10,500 M^-1 cm^-1\nl = 1 cm (assuming the path length is 1 cm, which is a common value)\n\nWe need to solve for c (the concentration):\n\n0.294 = 10,500 * c * 1\n\nNow, divide both sides by 10,500:\n\nc = 0.294 / 10,500\n\nc ≈ 0.000028 M\n\nSo, the concentration of iron (II) ion in the sample is approximately 0.000028 M or 28 µM."
