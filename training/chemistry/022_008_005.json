    "message_2": "When zinc metal is added to a copper(II) sulfate solution, a single displacement reaction occurs. Zinc is more reactive than copper in the reactivity series of metals. As a result, zinc displaces copper from the copper(II) sulfate solution, forming zinc sulfate and copper metal. The chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nZn(s) + CuSO4(aq) â†’ ZnSO4(aq) + Cu(s)\n\nIn terms of the reactivity series of metals, this reaction can be explained as follows: The reactivity series is a list of metals arranged in the order of their decreasing reactivity. A more reactive metal can displace a less reactive metal from its salt solution. In this case, zinc is higher in the reactivity series than copper, meaning it is more reactive. Therefore, zinc can displace copper from the copper(II) sulfate solution, forming zinc sulfate and copper metal."
