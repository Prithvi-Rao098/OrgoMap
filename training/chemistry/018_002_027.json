    "message_2": "For a reaction that follows first-order kinetics with respect to both A and B, the rate law can be expressed as:\n\nrate = k[A]^1[B]^1\n\nwhere rate is the initial rate of formation of C, k is the rate constant, and [A] and [B] are the concentrations of A and B, respectively.\n\nGiven the initial rate of formation of C (rate) = 2.5 x 10^-3 M/s, the concentration of A ([A]) = 0.1 M, and the concentration of B ([B]) = 0.2 M, we can solve for the rate constant (k) using the rate law equation:\n\n2.5 x 10^-3 M/s = k(0.1 M)(0.2 M)\n\nTo solve for k, divide both sides of the equation by (0.1 M)(0.2 M):\n\nk = (2.5 x 10^-3 M/s) / ((0.1 M)(0.2 M))\n\nk = (2.5 x 10^-3 M/s) / (0.02 M^2)\n\nk = 1.25 x 10^-1 M^-1s^-1\n\nThe rate constant (k) for the reaction is 1.25 x 10^-1 M^-1s^-1."
