    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the formula:\n\nΔH_reaction = Σ ΔHf_products - Σ ΔHf_reactants\n\nwhere ΔH_reaction is the standard enthalpy change for the reaction, ΔHf_products are the standard enthalpies of formation of the products, and ΔHf_reactants are the standard enthalpies of formation of the reactants.\n\nFor this reaction:\n\nΔH_reaction = [1 * (-1385 kJ/mol) + 2 * (-286 kJ/mol)] - [2 * (-425 kJ/mol) + 1 * (-814 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH_reaction = (-1385 - 572) - (-850 - 814)\n\nΔH_reaction = (-1957) - (-1664)\n\nΔH_reaction = -293 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the reaction is -293 kJ/mol."
