    "message_2": "To convert an amine into an amide, the reaction involves the acylation of the amine with an acyl chloride. Here's a general balanced chemical equation for this process:\n\nR-NH₂ + R'-COCl → R-NH-CO-R' + HCl\n\nIn this equation, R and R' represent alkyl or aryl groups. The reagents used in the process are the amine (R-NH₂) and the acyl chloride (R'-COCl)."
