    "message_2": "To determine the specific surface area of the activated carbon sample, we will use the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory. The BET theory relates the volume of gas adsorbed on a solid surface to the surface area of the solid. The equation for the BET theory is:\n\nV = (V_m * C * P) / [(P_0 - P) * (1 + (C - 1) * P / P_0)]\n\nWhere:\nV = volume of gas adsorbed at pressure P\nV_m = volume of gas required to form a monolayer on the surface\nC = BET constant related to the energy of adsorption\nP = pressure of the gas\nP_0 = saturation pressure of the gas\n\nFor our problem, we are given the volume of nitrogen gas adsorbed (V), the temperature, and the pressure. We will assume that the nitrogen gas forms a monolayer on the surface of the activated carbon. Therefore, V = V_m.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the volume of nitrogen gas from mL to moles. We can use the ideal gas law for this:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nWhere:\nP = pressure (1 atm)\nV = volume (29.6 mL = 0.0296 L)\nn = number of moles\nR = ideal gas constant (0.0821 L atm / K mol)\nT = temperature (-196°C = 77 K)\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for n:\n\nn = PV / RT\n\nn = (1 atm * 0.0296 L) / (0.0821 L atm / K mol * 77 K)\nn = 0.00118 mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the surface area of the activated carbon sample. The surface area of nitrogen gas is given as 16.2 Å². We will convert this to m²:\n\n16.2 Å² * (1 m / 1 × 10^10 Å)² = 16.2 × 10^-20 m²\n\nThe surface area of the activated carbon sample can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nSurface area = n * surface area of nitrogen gas * Avogadro's number\n\nWhere Avogadro's number is 6.022 × 10^23 mol⁻¹.\n\nSurface area = 0.00118 mol * 16.2 × 10^-20 m² * 6.022 × 10^23 mol⁻¹\nSurface area = 1150 m²\n\nTherefore, the specific surface area of the activated carbon sample is approximately 1150 m²."
