    "message_2": "The molecule CH3CH2CH2OH is propanol, specifically 1-propanol. The type of isomerism exhibited by this molecule is structural isomerism, specifically chain isomerism. This occurs when the carbon skeleton of the molecule is rearranged, but the molecular formula remains the same.\n\nThe corresponding isomer for CH3CH2CH2OH is 2-propanol (isopropanol). The structural formula for 2-propanol is:\n\nCH3-CH(OH)-CH3\n\nSo, the two isomers are:\n1. 1-propanol: CH3CH2CH2OH\n2. 2-propanol (isopropanol): CH3-CH(OH)-CH3"
