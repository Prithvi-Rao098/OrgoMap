    "message_2": "The dipole moment of a carbon monoxide (CO) molecule is a measure of the separation of positive and negative charges within the molecule. It is a vector quantity, which means it has both magnitude and direction. The dipole moment is calculated using the formula:\n\nμ = Q × d\n\nwhere μ is the dipole moment, Q is the charge difference between the two atoms, and d is the distance between the two atoms.\n\nIn the case of carbon monoxide, the electronegativity difference between carbon (C) and oxygen (O) causes a partial positive charge on the carbon atom and a partial negative charge on the oxygen atom. The electronegativity values for carbon and oxygen are 2.55 and 3.44, respectively. The difference in electronegativity is 0.89, which indicates a polar covalent bond.\n\nThe bond length between carbon and oxygen in CO is approximately 1.128 Å (angstroms), or 1.128 × 10^(-10) meters.\n\nTo calculate the dipole moment, we need to determine the charge difference (Q) between the two atoms. This can be done using the equation:\n\nQ = e × (ΔEN / EN_total)\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge (1.602 × 10^(-19) C), ΔEN is the difference in electronegativity between the two atoms, and EN_total is the sum of the electronegativities of the two atoms.\n\nQ = (1.602 × 10^(-19) C) × (0.89 / (2.55 + 3.44))\nQ ≈ 2.7 × 10^(-20) C\n\nNow, we can calculate the dipole moment:\n\nμ = Q × d\nμ = (2.7 × 10^(-20) C) × (1.128 × 10^(-10) m)\nμ ≈ 3.0 × 10^(-30) C·m\n\nThe dipole moment of a carbon monoxide molecule is approximately 3.0 × 10^(-30) C·m."
