    "message_2": "To calculate the heat capacity of 50 grams of pure water at 25°C, you can use the formula:\n\nHeat Capacity = mass × specific heat capacity\n\nwhere mass is the mass of the water (50 grams) and specific heat capacity is the specific heat capacity of water (4.184 J/g°C).\n\nHeat Capacity = 50 g × 4.184 J/g°C = 209.2 J/°C\n\nSo, the heat capacity of 50 grams of pure water at 25°C is 209.2 J/°C."
