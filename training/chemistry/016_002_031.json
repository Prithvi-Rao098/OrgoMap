    "message_2": "To determine the standard enthalpy of formation for ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), we need to manipulate the given reactions to obtain the desired reaction: NH3(g) + HCl(g) → NH4Cl(s). \n\nFirst, we need to find the enthalpy change for the formation of HCl(g). We can do this by manipulating the third reaction:\n\n3) N2(g) + 2H2(g) + 2Cl2(g) → 2NH4Cl(s) ΔH° = -634.2 kJ/mol\n\nDivide the entire reaction by 2:\n\n1/2 N2(g) + H2(g) + Cl2(g) → NH4Cl(s) ΔH° = -317.1 kJ/mol\n\nNow, subtract the first reaction from the new reaction:\n\n(1/2 N2(g) + H2(g) + Cl2(g) → NH4Cl(s)) - (N2(g) + 3H2(g) → 2NH3(g))\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n2H2(g) + Cl2(g) → 2HCl(g) ΔH° = -271.1 kJ/mol\n\nNow, divide the entire reaction by 2:\n\nH2(g) + 1/2 Cl2(g) → HCl(g) ΔH° = -135.55 kJ/mol\n\nNow we have the enthalpy change for the formation of HCl(g). Next, we need to add the enthalpy change for the formation of NH3(g) and HCl(g) to find the enthalpy change for the formation of NH4Cl(s):\n\n1) N2(g) + 3H2(g) → 2NH3(g) ΔH° = -46.0 kJ/mol (divide by 2)\n1/2 N2(g) + 3/2 H2(g) → NH3(g) ΔH° = -23.0 kJ/mol\n\nAdd the two reactions:\n\n1/2 N2(g) + 3/2 H2(g) → NH3(g) ΔH° = -23.0 kJ/mol\nH2(g) + 1/2 Cl2(g) → HCl(g) ΔH° = -135.55 kJ/mol\n--------------------------------------------\n1/2 N2(g) + 2H2(g) + 1/2 Cl2(g) → NH3(g) + HCl(g) ΔH° = -158.55 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can compare this reaction to the second given reaction:\n\n2) NH3(g) + HCl(g) → NH4Cl(s) ΔH° = -176.2 kJ/mol\n\nSince the reactions are the same, the standard enthalpy of formation for ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) is:\n\nΔH°(NH4Cl) = -176.2 kJ/mol"
