    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of energy needed to desorb 10 moles of hydrogen gas from a metal surface, we can use the following formula:\n\nEnergy = moles × enthalpy of desorption\n\nGiven that the enthalpy of desorption is -120 kJ/mol, we need to reverse the sign to find the energy needed to desorb the hydrogen gas. So, the enthalpy of desorption becomes +120 kJ/mol.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nEnergy = 10 moles × 120 kJ/mol\n\nEnergy = 1200 kJ\n\nTherefore, 1200 kJ of energy is needed to desorb 10 moles of hydrogen gas from the metal surface."
