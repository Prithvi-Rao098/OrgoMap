    "message_1": "What is the equilibrium constant expression for the formation of the complex ion [Cu(NH3)4]2+ from Cu2+ and NH3? If the initial concentration of Cu2+ is 0.1 M and the initial concentration of NH3 is 0.2 M, what will be the concentration of [Cu(NH3)4]2+ at equilibrium? If NH3 concentration is decreased to 0.1 M, what will be the new equilibrium concentration of [Cu(NH3)4]2+?",
    "message_2": "The formation of the complex ion [Cu(NH3)4]2+ from Cu2+ and NH3 can be represented by the following chemical equation:\n\nCu2+ + 4NH3 <=> [Cu(NH3)4]2+\n\nThe equilibrium constant expression for this reaction is given by:\n\nK = [ [Cu(NH3)4]2+ ] / ( [Cu2+] * [NH3]^4 )\n\nTo find the concentration of [Cu(NH3)4]2+ at equilibrium, we need the value of the equilibrium constant (K). However, since the value of K is not provided, we cannot calculate the exact concentration of [Cu(NH3)4]2+ at equilibrium.\n\nIf the initial concentration of NH3 is decreased to 0.1 M, the reaction will shift to re-establish equilibrium. However, without the value of K, we cannot determine the new equilibrium concentration of [Cu(NH3)4]2+."
