    "message_2": "The preparation of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid from benzoic acid and nitric acid involves an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. The mechanism proceeds as follows:\n\n1. Nitration of benzoic acid: Nitric acid (HNO3) reacts with a strong acid, usually sulfuric acid (H2SO4), to form the nitronium ion (NO2+), which is a strong electrophile.\n\nHNO3 + H2SO4 -> NO2+ + HSO4- + H2O\n\n2. Electrophilic attack: The nitronium ion (NO2+) attacks the benzene ring of benzoic acid, forming a resonance-stabilized carbocation intermediate. The ortho and para positions are more reactive due to the electron-donating effect of the carboxyl group (-COOH) in benzoic acid.\n\n3. Deprotonation: A hydrogen ion (H+) is removed from the carbocation intermediate by the bisulfate ion (HSO4-) or water (H2O), restoring the aromaticity of the benzene ring. This results in the formation of 3-nitrobenzoic acid.\n\n4. Second nitration: The 3-nitrobenzoic acid undergoes another nitration reaction with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming the nitronium ion (NO2+) again.\n\n5. Electrophilic attack: The nitronium ion (NO2+) attacks the benzene ring of 3-nitrobenzoic acid at the para position (relative to the nitro group) due to steric hindrance at the ortho position, forming a resonance-stabilized carbocation intermediate.\n\n6. Deprotonation: A hydrogen ion (H+) is removed from the carbocation intermediate by the bisulfate ion (HSO4-) or water (H2O), restoring the aromaticity of the benzene ring. This results in the formation of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid.\n\nThe overall reaction can be summarized as:\n\nC6H5COOH (benzoic acid) + 2 HNO3 (nitric acid) -> C6H3(NO2)2COOH (2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid) + 2 H2O (water)"
