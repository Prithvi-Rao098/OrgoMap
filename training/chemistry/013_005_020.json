    "message_2": "To calculate the surface area of the activated carbon powder, we can use the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory, which relates the amount of gas adsorbed to the surface area of the adsorbent. In this case, we are given the volume of nitrogen gas adsorbed, the temperature, and the pressure. We can use the following steps to find the surface area:\n\n1. Convert the volume of nitrogen gas to moles using the ideal gas law.\n2. Calculate the number of nitrogen molecules adsorbed.\n3. Multiply the number of nitrogen molecules by the cross-sectional area of a nitrogen molecule to get the surface area.\n\nStep 1: Convert the volume of nitrogen gas to moles\nPV = nRT\n\nWhere:\nP = pressure (1 atm)\nV = volume (12 mL = 0.012 L)\nn = moles of nitrogen gas\nR = ideal gas constant (0.0821 L atm / K mol)\nT = temperature (77 K)\n\nn = PV / RT\nn = (1 atm * 0.012 L) / (0.0821 L atm / K mol * 77 K)\nn ≈ 0.0019 moles\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of nitrogen molecules adsorbed\nNumber of molecules = moles * Avogadro's number\nNumber of molecules = 0.0019 moles * 6.022 x 10^23 molecules/mol\nNumber of molecules ≈ 1.14 x 10^21 molecules\n\nStep 3: Multiply the number of nitrogen molecules by the cross-sectional area of a nitrogen molecule\nSurface area = Number of molecules * Cross-sectional area of a nitrogen molecule\nSurface area = 1.14 x 10^21 molecules * 0.16 nm²/molecule\n\nSurface area ≈ 1.82 x 10^21 nm²\n\nThe surface area of the given sample of activated carbon powder is approximately 1.82 x 10^21 nm²."
