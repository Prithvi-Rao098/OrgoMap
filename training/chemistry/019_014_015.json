    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change of the precipitation reaction, we need to find the enthalpy of formation of the products and subtract the enthalpy of formation of the reactants. First, we need to find the moles of Pb(NO3)2 and NaCl in the reaction.\n\nMoles of Pb(NO3)2 = (0.100 mol/L) * (0.050 L) = 0.005 mol\n\nSince there is an excess of NaCl, we don't need to calculate its moles. Now, we need to find the enthalpy of formation of PbCl2(s). We can do this using the given enthalpy of formation values for NaNO3(aq) and NaCl(aq) and the balanced equation:\n\nPb(NO3)2(aq) + 2NaCl(aq) → PbCl2(s) + 2NaNO3(aq)\n\nΔH = Σ ΔHf(products) - Σ ΔHf(reactants)\n\nWe know the enthalpy of formation of NaNO3(aq) and NaCl(aq), but we need to find the enthalpy of formation of Pb(NO3)2(aq) and PbCl2(s). We can use the following equations:\n\n1) Pb(NO3)2(s) → Pb2+(aq) + 2NO3-(aq) ; ΔHf1\n2) PbCl2(s) → Pb2+(aq) + 2Cl-(aq) ; ΔHf2\n3) NaCl(aq) → Na+(aq) + Cl-(aq) ; ΔHf3 = -411.2 kJ/mol\n4) NaNO3(aq) → Na+(aq) + NO3-(aq) ; ΔHf4 = -467.7 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can write the balanced equation using these equations:\n\nPb(NO3)2(s) + 2NaCl(aq) → PbCl2(s) + 2NaNO3(aq)\nΔH = (ΔHf2 + 2ΔHf4) - (ΔHf1 + 2ΔHf3)\n\nWe have the values for ΔHf3 and ΔHf4, but we need to find ΔHf1 and ΔHf2. We can use the following relationships:\n\nΔHf1 = ΔHf(Pb2+(aq)) + 2ΔHf(NO3-(aq)) - ΔHf(Pb(NO3)2(s))\nΔHf2 = ΔHf(Pb2+(aq)) + 2ΔHf(Cl-(aq)) - ΔHf(PbCl2(s))\n\nWe can eliminate ΔHf(Pb2+(aq)) from these equations:\n\nΔHf2 - ΔHf1 = 2ΔHf(Cl-(aq)) - 2ΔHf(NO3-(aq)) - ΔHf(PbCl2(s)) + ΔHf(Pb(NO3)2(s))\n\nNow, we can substitute the known values into the equation:\n\nΔH = (ΔHf2 + 2(-467.7 kJ/mol)) - (ΔHf1 + 2(-411.2 kJ/mol))\nΔH = (ΔHf2 - ΔHf1) - 2(467.7 - 411.2) kJ/mol\nΔH = (ΔHf2 - ΔHf1) - 113.0 kJ/mol\n\nSince we don't have the values for ΔHf1 and ΔHf2, we cannot calculate the exact standard enthalpy change for this reaction. However, if you can find the enthalpy of formation values for Pb(NO3)2(s) and PbCl2(s), you can use the above equation to calculate the standard enthalpy change."
