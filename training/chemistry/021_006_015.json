    "message_2": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) has a linear molecular geometry with a carbon atom in the center and two oxygen atoms on either side. The carbon-oxygen bonds in CO2 are polar due to the difference in electronegativity between carbon (2.55) and oxygen (3.44). This results in a partial negative charge on the oxygen atoms and a partial positive charge on the carbon atom.\n\nHowever, the dipole moment of CO2 is zero. This is because the two polar C=O bonds are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, which causes their dipole moments to cancel each other out. In other words, the vector sum of the two bond dipoles is zero.\n\nTo visualize this, imagine the CO2 molecule as an arrow pointing from the carbon atom to each oxygen atom. The two arrows have the same length (magnitude) but point in opposite directions. When you add these two vectors together, they cancel each other out, resulting in a net dipole moment of zero.\n\nIn summary, although the individual C=O bonds in CO2 are polar, the overall molecule is nonpolar due to the cancellation of the bond dipoles, resulting in a dipole moment of zero."
