    "message_2": "The critical temperature of nitrogen is -147.15°C (-232.87°F) or 126 K. The critical temperature is the temperature above which a gas cannot be liquefied, regardless of the pressure applied. This value is important in industrial applications because it helps determine the conditions required to liquefy nitrogen or maintain it in a gaseous state.\n\nIn industrial applications, nitrogen is often used in its liquid form as a coolant, for example, in cryogenic freezing and preservation, as well as in the manufacturing of electronic components. Knowing the critical temperature of nitrogen allows industries to design and operate equipment that can safely and efficiently handle nitrogen in its liquid or gaseous state.\n\nAdditionally, nitrogen gas is used in various industries for inerting purposes, such as in the food packaging industry to displace oxygen and prevent spoilage, or in the chemical industry to prevent unwanted reactions. Understanding the critical temperature of nitrogen helps ensure that the gas remains in its desired state during these processes."
