    "message_2": "The nucleophilic addition reaction of a primary amine with an aldehyde or ketone results in the formation of an imine. The mechanism is similar for both aldehydes and ketones, but the reactivity of aldehydes is generally higher than that of ketones due to the presence of an electron-donating alkyl group in ketones, which makes the carbonyl carbon less electrophilic.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of the nucleophilic addition reaction between ethanal (an aldehyde) and ethylamine (a primary amine):\n\n1. Protonation of the carbonyl oxygen: The lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom of ethylamine attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of ethanal, forming a tetrahedral intermediate. This results in the carbonyl oxygen becoming negatively charged.\n\nEthanal: CH3CHO\nEthylamine: CH3CH2NH2\n\nCH3CHO + CH3CH2NH2 → CH3CH(O-)NHCH2CH3\n\n2. Proton transfer: The negatively charged oxygen atom abstracts a proton from the nitrogen atom of the ethylamine, resulting in the formation of a hydroxyl group and a neutral nitrogen atom.\n\nCH3CH(O-)NHCH2CH3 → CH3CH(OH)NHCH2CH3\n\n3. Elimination of water: The hydroxyl group and a hydrogen atom from the nitrogen are eliminated as a water molecule, forming a double bond between the nitrogen and the carbon atom.\n\nCH3CH(OH)NHCH2CH3 → CH3CH=NHCH2CH3 + H2O\n\n4. Formation of the imine: The final product is an imine, N-ethylmethanimine in this case.\n\nCH3CH=NHCH2CH3\n\nThe mechanism for the reaction between a primary amine and a ketone is similar to the one described above. However, ketones are less reactive than aldehydes due to the presence of an electron-donating alkyl group, which makes the carbonyl carbon less electrophilic. This means that the nucleophilic attack by the amine is slower in the case of ketones compared to aldehydes."
