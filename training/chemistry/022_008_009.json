    "message_2": "When zinc is added to a copper sulfate solution, a single replacement reaction occurs. In this reaction, zinc displaces copper from the copper sulfate solution, forming zinc sulfate and copper as products. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nZn (s) + CuSO₄ (aq) → ZnSO₄ (aq) + Cu (s)\n\nIn this single replacement reaction, zinc (Zn) is more reactive than copper (Cu), so it can replace copper in the copper sulfate (CuSO₄) compound. As a result, zinc sulfate (ZnSO₄) is formed, and copper (Cu) is released as a solid. This reaction can be observed as the solution changes color and solid copper forms at the bottom of the container."
