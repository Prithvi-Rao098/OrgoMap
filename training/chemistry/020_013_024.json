    "message_1": "What is the equilibrium constant, Kc, for the dissociation of acetic acid, CH3COOH, in water at 25°C, if the concentration of the acid is 0.10 M and the concentration of the acetate ion, CH3COO-, is 0.02 M?",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the dissociation of acetic acid in water, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nCH3COOH (aq) + H2O (l) ⇌ CH3COO- (aq) + H3O+ (aq)\n\nSince water is a liquid, we do not include it in the equilibrium expression. The equilibrium expression for this reaction is:\n\nKc = [CH3COO-][H3O+] / [CH3COOH]\n\nWe are given the concentrations of CH3COOH and CH3COO- at equilibrium. However, we are not given the concentration of H3O+ ions. Since acetic acid is a weak acid, we can assume that the concentration of H3O+ ions is equal to the concentration of CH3COO- ions at equilibrium. This is because for every molecule of acetic acid that dissociates, one molecule of CH3COO- and one molecule of H3O+ are produced.\n\nTherefore, [H3O+] = 0.02 M\n\nNow we can plug the given concentrations into the equilibrium expression:\n\nKc = (0.02)(0.02) / (0.10) = 0.004\n\nThe equilibrium constant, Kc, for the dissociation of acetic acid in water at 25°C is 0.004."
