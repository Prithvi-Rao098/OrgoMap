    "message_2": "The synthesis of ibuprofen from 2-methylpropylbenzene (isobutylbenzene) and carbon dioxide can be achieved through a series of reactions. Here is a step-by-step reaction mechanism:\n\n1. Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:\nFirst, we need to introduce a carbonyl group to the isobutylbenzene. This can be done through Friedel-Crafts acylation, using acetyl chloride (CH3COCl) and aluminum chloride (AlCl3) as a catalyst.\n- Isobutylbenzene + CH3COCl (in the presence of AlCl3) → 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanoyl chloride\n\n2. Hydrolysis:\nNext, we need to convert the acyl chloride to a carboxylic acid. This can be done through hydrolysis.\n- 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanoyl chloride + H2O → 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanoic acid\n\n3. Kolbe-Schmitt Reaction:\nNow, we need to introduce a second carboxylic acid group to the molecule using the Kolbe-Schmitt reaction. This involves treating the 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanoic acid with carbon dioxide (CO2) and a strong base like sodium hydroxide (NaOH) under high pressure and temperature.\n- 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanoic acid + CO2 + NaOH → sodium 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)-propionate + H2O\n\n4. Acidification:\nFinally, we need to convert the sodium salt of the carboxylic acid back to the free carboxylic acid, which is ibuprofen. This can be done by acidification using a strong acid like hydrochloric acid (HCl).\n- Sodium 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)-propionate + HCl → ibuprofen (2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionic acid) + NaCl\n\nIn summary, the synthesis of ibuprofen from 2-methylpropylbenzene and carbon dioxide involves Friedel-Crafts acylation, hydrolysis, Kolbe-Schmitt reaction, and acidification."
