    "message_1": "How will the concentration of reactants and products change if a stress is applied to a system at equilibrium? Consider the reaction N2O4(g) ⇄ 2NO2(g) and predict the direction of the reaction and the resulting concentration changes when the volume of the reaction vessel is increased.",
    "message_2": "When a stress is applied to a system at equilibrium, the system will respond by shifting the position of the equilibrium to counteract the stress. This is known as Le Chatelier's principle.\n\nFor the reaction N2O4(g) ⇄ 2NO2(g), let's consider the effect of increasing the volume of the reaction vessel.\n\nWhen the volume is increased, the pressure of the system decreases. According to Le Chatelier's principle, the system will shift the equilibrium position to counteract this decrease in pressure. In this case, the system will shift the equilibrium towards the side with more moles of gas to increase the pressure.\n\nIn the given reaction, there are 1 mole of N2O4(g) on the left side and 2 moles of NO2(g) on the right side. Since there are more moles of gas on the right side, the equilibrium will shift to the right to produce more NO2(g) and consume N2O4(g).\n\nAs a result, the concentration of N2O4(g) will decrease, and the concentration of NO2(g) will increase. This shift in equilibrium will continue until a new equilibrium is established at the increased volume."
