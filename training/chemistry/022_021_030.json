    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant expression (Kc) for the reaction, we need to use the balanced chemical equation:\n\nN2 + O2 ⇌ 2NO\n\nThe equilibrium constant expression for this reaction is given by:\n\nKc = [NO]^2 / ([N2] * [O2])\n\nNow, we are given the equilibrium concentrations of N2, O2, and NO:\n\n[N2] = 0.25 M\n[O2] = 0.15 M\n[NO] = 0.5 M\n\nSubstitute these values into the Kc expression:\n\nKc = (0.5)^2 / (0.25 * 0.15)\n\nKc = 0.25 / 0.0375\n\nKc ≈ 6.67\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for this reaction is approximately 6.67."
