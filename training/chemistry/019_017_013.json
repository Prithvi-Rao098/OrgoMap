    "message_2": "The standard enthalpy change (∆H°) for the sublimation of iodine (I2) can be found in reference tables or calculated from experimental data. The sublimation of iodine is the process of solid iodine turning into gaseous iodine without passing through the liquid phase. \n\nAccording to the reference data, the standard enthalpy change for the sublimation of iodine (I2) at 298K is approximately 62.44 kJ/mol."
