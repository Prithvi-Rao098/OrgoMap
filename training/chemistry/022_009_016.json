    "message_2": "To find the balanced equation for the double replacement reaction between potassium iodide (KI) and lead (II) nitrate (Pb(NO₃)₂), we first identify the products that will be formed. In a double replacement reaction, the positive ions (cations) and negative ions (anions) switch places.\n\nPotassium (K⁺) will pair with nitrate (NO₃⁻), and lead (Pb²⁺) will pair with iodide (I⁻). The products formed will be potassium nitrate (KNO₃) and lead (II) iodide (PbI₂).\n\nNow, we balance the equation:\n\n2 KI (aq) + Pb(NO₃)₂ (aq) → 2 KNO₃ (aq) + PbI₂ (s)\n\nTo find the mass of lead (II) iodide (PbI₂) produced, we will use stoichiometry. We are given 35 grams of potassium iodide (KI) and an excess of lead (II) nitrate (Pb(NO₃)₂), so KI is the limiting reactant.\n\nFirst, we need to find the molar mass of KI and PbI₂:\n\nMolar mass of KI = 39.10 g/mol (K) + 126.90 g/mol (I) = 166.00 g/mol\nMolar mass of PbI₂ = 207.2 g/mol (Pb) + 2 * 126.90 g/mol (I) = 460.00 g/mol\n\nNow, we can use stoichiometry to find the mass of PbI₂ produced:\n\n35 g KI * (1 mol KI / 166.00 g KI) * (1 mol PbI₂ / 2 mol KI) * (460.00 g PbI₂ / 1 mol PbI₂) = 38.11 g PbI₂\n\nSo, 38.11 grams of lead (II) iodide will be produced."
