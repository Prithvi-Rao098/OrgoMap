    "message_2": "For a first-order reaction, the rate constant (k) can be determined using the half-life (t1/2) with the following equation:\n\nk = 0.693 / t1/2\n\nGiven that the half-life (t1/2) is 120 seconds, we can calculate the rate constant (k) as follows:\n\nk = 0.693 / 120\nk ≈ 0.005775 s⁻¹\n\nThe rate constant for this first-order decomposition reaction is approximately 0.005775 s⁻¹. Note that the initial concentration of the reactant is not needed to calculate the rate constant for a first-order reaction."
