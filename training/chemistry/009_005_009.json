The mass of a proton is 1.0073 amu and the mass of a neutron is 1.0087 amu. Hint: You may need to refer to a periodic table for the atomic masses of carbon and nitrogen.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the nuclear binding energy released during the decay of carbon-14 to nitrogen-14, we first need to determine the mass difference between the initial and final states of the decay process.\n\n1. Calculate the mass of carbon-14:\nCarbon-14 has 6 protons and 8 neutrons.\nMass of carbon-14 = (6 * mass of proton) + (8 * mass of neutron)\nMass of carbon-14 = (6 * 1.0073 amu) + (8 * 1.0087 amu) = 6.0438 amu + 8.0696 amu = 14.1134 amu\n\n2. Calculate the mass of nitrogen-14:\nNitrogen-14 has 7 protons and 7 neutrons.\nMass of nitrogen-14 = (7 * mass of proton) + (7 * mass of neutron)\nMass of nitrogen-14 = (7 * 1.0073 amu) + (7 * 1.0087 amu) = 7.0511 amu + 7.0609 amu = 14.1120 amu\n\n3. Calculate the mass difference:\nMass difference = Mass of carbon-14 - Mass of nitrogen-14\nMass difference = 14.1134 amu - 14.1120 amu = 0.0014 amu\n\n4. Convert the mass difference to energy using Einstein's mass-energy equivalence formula, E=mc^2:\n1 amu = 1.66054 x 10^(-27) kg\nMass difference in kg = 0.0014 amu * 1.66054 x 10^(-27) kg/amu = 2.32476 x 10^(-30) kg\n\nSpeed of light, c = 3 x 10^8 m/s\nEnergy released = (2.32476 x 10^(-30) kg) * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2 = 2.09228 x 10^(-13) J\n\n5. Convert the energy to MeV (Mega electron volts):\n1 MeV = 1.60218 x 10^(-13) J\nEnergy released = (2.09228 x 10^(-13) J) / (1.60218 x 10^(-13) J/MeV) = 1.306 MeV\n\nThe nuclear binding energy released during the decay of carbon-14 to nitrogen-14 is approximately 1.306 MeV."
