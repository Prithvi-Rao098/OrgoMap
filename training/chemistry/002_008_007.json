    "message_2": "To find the percent composition of Sodium Chloride (NaCl), we need to determine the mass of each element (sodium and chlorine) in the compound and then calculate their percentage of the total mass.\n\nFirst, we need to find the molar mass of NaCl. The atomic mass of sodium (Na) is approximately 22.99 g/mol, and the atomic mass of chlorine (Cl) is approximately 35.45 g/mol.\n\nMolar mass of NaCl = (22.99 g/mol Na) + (35.45 g/mol Cl) = 58.44 g/mol NaCl\n\nNow, we need to find the mass of each element in the 15 grams of NaCl.\n\nTo do this, we can use the mass fraction of each element in NaCl:\n\nMass fraction of Na = (mass of Na) / (molar mass of NaCl) = 22.99 g/mol / 58.44 g/mol = 0.3933\n\nMass fraction of Cl = (mass of Cl) / (molar mass of NaCl) = 35.45 g/mol / 58.44 g/mol = 0.6067\n\nNow, we can find the mass of each element in the 15 grams of NaCl:\n\nMass of Na = (mass fraction of Na) × (total mass of NaCl) = 0.3933 × 15 g = 5.8995 g\n\nMass of Cl = (mass fraction of Cl) × (total mass of NaCl) = 0.6067 × 15 g = 9.1005 g\n\nFinally, we can find the percent composition of each element in NaCl:\n\nPercent composition of Na = (mass of Na / total mass of NaCl) × 100% = (5.8995 g / 15 g) × 100% = 39.33%\n\nPercent composition of Cl = (mass of Cl / total mass of NaCl) × 100% = (9.1005 g / 15 g) × 100% = 60.67%\n\nSo, the percent composition of Sodium Chloride (NaCl) is approximately 39.33% sodium (Na) and 60.67% chlorine (Cl)."
