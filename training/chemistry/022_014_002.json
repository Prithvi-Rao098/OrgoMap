    "message_1": "Suppose in a chemical reaction, 3 moles of A react with 2 moles of B to produce 4 moles of C. If 4 moles of A and 3 moles of B are available for the reaction, which reactant is the limiting reactant and what is the mass of the excess reactant?",
    "message_2": "To determine the limiting reactant, we can compare the mole ratios of the reactants available to the mole ratios required by the balanced chemical equation.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation is:\n3A + 2B â†’ 4C\n\nWe are given 4 moles of A and 3 moles of B. To find out which reactant is limiting, we can divide the moles of each reactant by their respective coefficients in the balanced equation:\n\nFor A: 4 moles / 3 = 1.33\nFor B: 3 moles / 2 = 1.5\n\nSince 1.33 is less than 1.5, A is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow, we need to find the mass of the excess reactant (B). First, we need to determine how many moles of B were actually used in the reaction. We can do this by using the mole ratio between A and B from the balanced equation:\n\n(3 moles of A / 2 moles of B) = (4 moles of A used / x moles of B used)\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx = (2 moles of B / 3 moles of A) * 4 moles of A used\nx = 8/3 moles of B used\n\nNow we can find the remaining moles of B:\n\n3 moles of B available - 8/3 moles of B used = 1/3 moles of B remaining\n\nTo find the mass of the excess reactant (B), we need to know the molar mass of B. Let's assume the molar mass of B is M grams/mole. Then, the mass of the excess reactant (B) can be calculated as:\n\nMass of excess B = (1/3 moles of B remaining) * M grams/mole\n\nWithout knowing the molar mass of B, we cannot provide a specific numerical value for the mass of the excess reactant. However, the formula above can be used to calculate the mass once the molar mass of B is known."
