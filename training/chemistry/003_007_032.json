    "message_2": "To find the probability that a system of N non-interacting particles at temperature T is found in the quantum state with energy E, we can use the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann distribution gives the probability of a particle being in a specific energy state based on the energy of that state and the temperature of the system.\n\nThe probability P(E) of a particle being in an energy state E is given by:\n\nP(E) = (1/Z) * e^(-E/kT)\n\nwhere:\n- E is the energy of the quantum state,\n- k is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K),\n- T is the temperature of the system in Kelvin,\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.718),\n- Z is the partition function, which is a normalization factor that ensures the sum of probabilities of all possible energy states is equal to 1.\n\nThe partition function Z is given by:\n\nZ = Î£ e^(-E_i/kT)\n\nwhere the sum is over all possible energy states E_i.\n\nFor a system of N non-interacting particles, the probability of the entire system being in a specific energy state E is given by the product of the probabilities of each individual particle being in their respective energy states. However, since the particles are non-interacting and indistinguishable, we can simply raise the probability of a single particle being in the energy state E to the power of N:\n\nP_N(E) = P(E)^N\n\nSo, the probability that a system of N non-interacting particles at temperature T is found in the quantum state with energy E is:\n\nP_N(E) = [(1/Z) * e^(-E/kT)]^N"
