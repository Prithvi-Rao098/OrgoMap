    "message_2": "The bond energy required to break one mole of O-H bonds in a water molecule (H2O) is approximately 463 kJ/mol. However, since there are two O-H bonds in a water molecule, the total energy required to break all the O-H bonds in one mole of water molecules would be approximately 926 kJ/mol."
