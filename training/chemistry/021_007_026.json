    "message_2": "To calculate the formal charge of the nitrogen atom in HNO3, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the number of valence electrons for nitrogen. Nitrogen is in group 15, so it has 5 valence electrons.\n\n2. Calculate the number of bonding electrons. In HNO3, nitrogen forms two single bonds (with one hydrogen and one oxygen) and one double bond (with another oxygen). Each single bond has 2 electrons, and the double bond has 4 electrons. So, there are a total of 2 + 2 + 4 = 8 bonding electrons.\n\n3. Calculate the number of non-bonding electrons. Since nitrogen has 5 valence electrons and 8 bonding electrons, there are 5 - 8/2 = 5 - 4 = 1 non-bonding electron.\n\n4. Calculate the formal charge. The formal charge is the difference between the number of valence electrons and the sum of the bonding and non-bonding electrons. In this case, the formal charge of nitrogen in HNO3 is 5 - (8/2 + 1) = 5 - (4 + 1) = 5 - 5 = 0.\n\nSo, the formal charge of the nitrogen atom in HNO3 is 0."
