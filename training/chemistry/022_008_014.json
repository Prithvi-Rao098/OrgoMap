    "message_2": "When a piece of zinc metal is placed in a solution of copper(II) sulfate, a single displacement (redox) reaction occurs. Zinc displaces copper from the copper(II) sulfate solution, forming zinc sulfate and copper metal. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nZn (s) + CuSO4 (aq) â†’ ZnSO4 (aq) + Cu (s)\n\nIn this reaction, zinc is being oxidized (loses electrons) and copper is being reduced (gains electrons).\n\nTo calculate the mass of copper that will be formed, first, we need to determine the limiting reactant. We are given 25 grams of zinc and 100 mL of 0.5 M copper(II) sulfate solution.\n\n1. Convert the mass of zinc to moles:\nZn: 25 g * (1 mol / 65.38 g) = 0.3825 mol\n\n2. Convert the volume and concentration of copper(II) sulfate solution to moles:\nCuSO4: 100 mL * (1 L / 1000 mL) * (0.5 mol / L) = 0.05 mol\n\nSince there is a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio between Zn and CuSO4, the copper(II) sulfate solution is the limiting reactant.\n\n3. Calculate the moles of copper that will be formed:\n0.05 mol CuSO4 * (1 mol Cu / 1 mol CuSO4) = 0.05 mol Cu\n\n4. Convert the moles of copper to mass:\n0.05 mol Cu * (63.55 g / mol) = 3.1775 g\n\nSo, 3.1775 grams of copper will be formed when 25 grams of zinc is added to 100 mL of 0.5 M copper(II) sulfate solution."
