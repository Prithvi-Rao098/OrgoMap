    "message_2": "To apply the concepts of stoichiometry to determine the amount of reactants and products in the combustion of gasoline in a car engine, we first need to write a balanced chemical equation for the reaction. Gasoline is primarily composed of octane (C8H18), which reacts with oxygen (O2) to produce carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\n2 C8H18 + 25 O2 -> 16 CO2 + 18 H2O\n\nNow, let's assume we want to calculate the amount of CO2 produced when 100 grams of octane is burned in a car engine. Here are the steps to perform the stoichiometric calculation:\n\n1. Convert the mass of octane to moles:\nTo do this, we need the molar mass of octane, which is approximately 114 g/mol (12 g/mol for each carbon atom and 1 g/mol for each hydrogen atom).\n\n100 g C8H18 * (1 mol C8H18 / 114 g C8H18) = 0.877 mol C8H18\n\n2. Use the stoichiometric coefficients from the balanced equation to determine the moles of CO2 produced:\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 2 moles of octane react to produce 16 moles of CO2. Therefore, we can set up a proportion to determine the moles of CO2 produced from the moles of octane.\n\n(16 mol CO2 / 2 mol C8H18) = (x mol CO2 / 0.877 mol C8H18)\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 7.016 mol CO2\n\n3. Convert the moles of CO2 to grams:\nTo do this, we need the molar mass of CO2, which is approximately 44 g/mol (12 g/mol for the carbon atom and 16 g/mol for each oxygen atom).\n\n7.016 mol CO2 * (44 g CO2 / 1 mol CO2) = 308.7 g CO2\n\nSo, when 100 grams of octane is burned in a car engine, approximately 308.7 grams of CO2 is produced. This demonstrates the use of stoichiometry in a real-world chemical reaction scenario."
