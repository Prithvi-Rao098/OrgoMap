    "message_2": "To find the empirical formula, we first need to convert the percentages to moles. We can assume a 100 g sample of the compound, so the mass of each element would be:\n\nSodium (Na): 22.2 g\nOxygen (O): 53.2 g\nSulfur (S): 24.6 g\n\nNow, we'll convert these masses to moles using the molar masses of each element:\n\nNa: 22.2 g / 22.99 g/mol = 0.965 moles\nO: 53.2 g / 16.00 g/mol = 3.325 moles\nS: 24.6 g / 32.07 g/mol = 0.767 moles\n\nNext, we'll divide each value by the smallest number of moles to find the mole ratio:\n\nNa: 0.965 / 0.767 = 1.26 ≈ 1\nO: 3.325 / 0.767 = 4.33 ≈ 4\nS: 0.767 / 0.767 = 1\n\nSo, the empirical formula is NaOS4.\n\nNow, we'll find the molecular formula using the given molar mass of 142.04 g/mol. First, we need to find the molar mass of the empirical formula:\n\nNa: 22.99 g/mol\nO: 16.00 g/mol * 4 = 64.00 g/mol\nS: 32.07 g/mol\n\nTotal molar mass of empirical formula: 22.99 + 64.00 + 32.07 = 119.06 g/mol\n\nNow, we'll divide the given molar mass (142.04 g/mol) by the molar mass of the empirical formula (119.06 g/mol):\n\n142.04 / 119.06 = 1.19 ≈ 1\n\nSince the ratio is approximately 1, the molecular formula is the same as the empirical formula: NaOS4."
