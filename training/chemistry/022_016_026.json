    "message_2": "To calculate the change in enthalpy (ΔH) for the given chemical reaction, we can use the formula:\n\nΔH = Σ ΔH(products) - Σ ΔH(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH(products) is the sum of the enthalpies of formation of the products, and ΔH(reactants) is the sum of the enthalpies of formation of the reactants.\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\nCH4(g) + 2O2(g) -> CO2(g) + 2H2O(l)\n\nThe enthalpies of formation are:\n\nΔHf(CH4) = -74.8 kJ/mol\nΔHf(CO2) = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔHf(H2O) = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy of formation for O2(g) is 0 kJ/mol since it is in its standard state.\n\nNow, we can calculate the change in enthalpy:\n\nΔH = [1 × (-393.5) + 2 × (-285.8)] - [1 × (-74.8) + 2 × 0]\n\nΔH = (-393.5 - 571.6) - (-74.8)\n\nΔH = -965.1 + 74.8\n\nΔH = -890.3 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the change in enthalpy for the given chemical reaction is -890.3 kJ/mol."
