    "message_2": "To determine the activation energy (Ea) for the electrochemical reaction between zinc and copper (II) sulfate solution, we can use the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk = A * e^(-Ea / RT)\n\nwhere k is the rate constant, A is the pre-exponential factor, Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nWe have two sets of data: k1 = 2.8 x 10^-3 s^-1 at T1 = 298 K, and k2 = 8.7 x 10^-3 s^-1 at T2 = 308 K. We can set up two equations using the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk1 = A * e^(-Ea / R * T1)\nk2 = A * e^(-Ea / R * T2)\n\nNow, we can divide the first equation by the second equation to eliminate the pre-exponential factor (A):\n\nk1 / k2 = e^(-Ea / R * T1) / e^(-Ea / R * T2)\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\nk1 / k2 = e^[(Ea / R) * (1/T2 - 1/T1)]\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values for k1, k2, T1, and T2:\n\n(2.8 x 10^-3) / (8.7 x 10^-3) = e^[(Ea / 8.314) * (1/308 - 1/298)]\n\n0.3218 = e^[(Ea / 8.314) * (-0.00322)]\n\nNow, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(0.3218) = (Ea / 8.314) * (-0.00322)\n\n-1.134 = (Ea / 8.314) * (-0.00322)\n\nNow, solve for Ea:\n\nEa = -1.134 / (-0.00322) * 8.314\n\nEa ≈ 2919.6 J/mol\n\nThe activation energy for the electrochemical reaction between zinc and copper (II) sulfate solution is approximately 2919.6 J/mol."
