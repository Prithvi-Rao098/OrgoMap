    "message_2": "To determine the effect of temperature on the equilibrium constant (Kc) of the reaction N2O4(g) ⇌ 2NO2(g), we need to know the enthalpy change (ΔH) of the reaction. The reaction is endothermic, meaning it absorbs heat from the surroundings. For this reaction, the enthalpy change (ΔH) is positive, around +57.2 kJ/mol.\n\nWe can use the van't Hoff equation to relate the change in temperature to the change in the equilibrium constant:\n\nln(Kc2/Kc1) = -ΔH/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere Kc1 and Kc2 are the equilibrium constants at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively, ΔH is the enthalpy change of the reaction, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), and T1 and T2 are the initial and final temperatures in Kelvin.\n\nFirst, convert the temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin:\nT1 = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\nT2 = 50°C + 273.15 = 323.15 K\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the van't Hoff equation. However, we don't have the values for Kc1 and Kc2. We can still determine the effect of temperature on Kc by analyzing the equation:\n\nln(Kc2/Kc1) = -ΔH/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nSince ΔH is positive for an endothermic reaction, the term -ΔH is negative. The term (1/T2 - 1/T1) is also negative because T2 > T1. Therefore, the product of these two negative terms is positive, which means that ln(Kc2/Kc1) is positive. This implies that Kc2 > Kc1.\n\nIn conclusion, when the temperature is increased from 25°C to 50°C for the endothermic reaction N2O4(g) ⇌ 2NO2(g), the equilibrium constant (Kc) will increase. This means that the reaction will shift towards the products (NO2) at the higher temperature, favoring the formation of more NO2 molecules."
