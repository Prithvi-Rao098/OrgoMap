    "message_2": "To determine the bond order and bond length of the C-O bond in carbon monoxide (CO), we need to examine its molecular orbital (MO) configuration. Carbon monoxide is a diatomic molecule, and its MO diagram can be derived from the atomic orbitals of carbon (C) and oxygen (O).\n\nCarbon has an electronic configuration of [He] 2s² 2p², while oxygen has an electronic configuration of [He] 2s² 2p⁴. In CO, the 2s and 2p orbitals of carbon and oxygen combine to form molecular orbitals. The molecular orbitals formed are σ2s, σ2s*, σ2p, π2p, π2p*, and σ2p*.\n\nThe electron configuration of CO is:\n\nσ2s² σ2s*² σ2p² π2p⁴\n\nNow, we can calculate the bond order. Bond order is defined as (number of electrons in bonding orbitals - number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2.\n\nBond order = (2 + 2 + 4 - 2) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3\n\nThe bond order of the C-O bond in carbon monoxide is 3, which indicates a triple bond between the carbon and oxygen atoms.\n\nTo determine the bond length, we can refer to experimental data or use a general trend. In general, as bond order increases, bond length decreases. This is because more bonds between the atoms result in a stronger attraction, pulling the atoms closer together. For comparison, the bond length of a C-O single bond in a molecule like methanol (CH3OH) is approximately 1.43 Å, while the bond length of a C=O double bond in a molecule like formaldehyde (H2CO) is approximately 1.20 Å.\n\nThe bond length of the C≡O triple bond in carbon monoxide is shorter than both of these values, and it is experimentally determined to be approximately 1.13 Å.\n\nIn summary, the bond order of the C-O bond in carbon monoxide (CO) is 3, and its bond length is approximately 1.13 Å."
