    "message_2": "There are four main types of chemical reactions: synthesis, decomposition, single displacement, and double displacement. Here are examples of each type, along with their balanced chemical equations:\n\n1. Synthesis (Combination) Reaction:\nIn a synthesis reaction, two or more reactants combine to form a single product.\n\nExample: Formation of water from hydrogen and oxygen\nUnbalanced equation: H2 + O2 → H2O\nBalanced equation: 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O\n\n2. Decomposition Reaction:\nIn a decomposition reaction, a single reactant breaks down into two or more simpler products.\n\nExample: Decomposition of potassium chlorate into potassium chloride and oxygen\nUnbalanced equation: KClO3 → KCl + O2\nBalanced equation: 2KClO3 → 2KCl + 3O2\n\n3. Single Displacement (Substitution) Reaction:\nIn a single displacement reaction, one element in a compound is replaced by another element.\n\nExample: Displacement of copper by zinc in a copper sulfate solution\nUnbalanced equation: Zn + CuSO4 → ZnSO4 + Cu\nBalanced equation: Zn + CuSO4 → ZnSO4 + Cu\n\n4. Double Displacement (Metathesis) Reaction:\nIn a double displacement reaction, the ions of two compounds exchange places, forming two new compounds.\n\nExample: Reaction between sodium chloride and silver nitrate to form sodium nitrate and silver chloride\nUnbalanced equation: NaCl + AgNO3 → NaNO3 + AgCl\nBalanced equation: NaCl + AgNO3 → NaNO3 + AgCl"
