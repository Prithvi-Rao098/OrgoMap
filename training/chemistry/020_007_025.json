    "message_2": "When the pressure of a system involving gases in a chemical reaction is changed, the equilibrium position of the reaction can shift according to Le Chatelier's principle. Le Chatelier's principle states that if a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in pressure, temperature, or concentration of reactants or products, the system will adjust its equilibrium position to counteract the change.\n\nIn the case of a chemical reaction involving gases, an increase in pressure will cause the equilibrium to shift in the direction that reduces the total number of gas molecules, while a decrease in pressure will cause the equilibrium to shift in the direction that increases the total number of gas molecules. This occurs because the system aims to minimize the effect of the pressure change.\n\nTo predict the shift in equilibrium position using Le Chatelier's principle, you need to consider the balanced chemical equation for the reaction and the number of moles of gas on both sides of the equation. For example, consider the following reaction:\n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) â‡Œ 2NH3(g)\n\nIn this reaction, there are 4 moles of gas on the left side (1 mole of N2 and 3 moles of H2) and 2 moles of gas on the right side (2 moles of NH3).\n\n1. If the pressure is increased, the equilibrium will shift to the side with fewer moles of gas to counteract the increase in pressure. In this case, the equilibrium will shift to the right, favoring the formation of NH3.\n\n2. If the pressure is decreased, the equilibrium will shift to the side with more moles of gas to counteract the decrease in pressure. In this case, the equilibrium will shift to the left, favoring the formation of N2 and H2.\n\nBy applying Le Chatelier's principle, you can predict how the equilibrium position of a chemical reaction involving gases will shift in response to changes in pressure."
