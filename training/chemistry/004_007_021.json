    "message_2": "To determine the mass of silver nitrate (AgNO3) present in the 25.0 mL solution of 0.150 M silver nitrate, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Convert the volume of the solution from mL to L.\n2. Use the molarity of the solution to find the moles of AgNO3.\n3. Convert the moles of AgNO3 to grams using the molar mass of AgNO3.\n\nStep 1: Convert the volume of the solution from mL to L.\n25.0 mL = 25.0 / 1000 = 0.025 L\n\nStep 2: Use the molarity of the solution to find the moles of AgNO3.\nMolarity (M) = moles of solute / volume of solution (L)\n0.150 M = moles of AgNO3 / 0.025 L\nmoles of AgNO3 = 0.150 M * 0.025 L = 0.00375 moles\n\nStep 3: Convert the moles of AgNO3 to grams using the molar mass of AgNO3.\nMolar mass of AgNO3 = 107.87 g/mol (Ag) + 14.01 g/mol (N) + 3 * 16.00 g/mol (O) = 169.87 g/mol\nMass of AgNO3 = moles of AgNO3 * molar mass of AgNO3\nMass of AgNO3 = 0.00375 moles * 169.87 g/mol = 0.636 g\n\nSo, the mass of silver nitrate present in the 25.0 mL solution of 0.150 M silver nitrate is 0.636 grams."
