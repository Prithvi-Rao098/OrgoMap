    "message_2": "A nucleotide is composed of three components: a nitrogenous base, a pentose sugar, and a phosphate group.\n\n1. Nitrogenous base: There are two types of nitrogenous bases - purines (adenine and guanine) and pyrimidines (cytosine, thymine, and uracil). In DNA, adenine pairs with thymine and guanine pairs with cytosine, while in RNA, adenine pairs with uracil and guanine pairs with cytosine.\n\n2. Pentose sugar: The sugar component of a nucleotide is a five-carbon sugar. In DNA, the sugar is deoxyribose, while in RNA, the sugar is ribose. The difference between these two sugars is the presence of a hydroxyl group (-OH) on the 2' carbon in ribose and a hydrogen atom in deoxyribose.\n\n3. Phosphate group: The phosphate group is attached to the 5' carbon of the pentose sugar and is responsible for the formation of the phosphodiester bond between adjacent nucleotides in a nucleic acid chain.\n\nThe structure of a nucleotide is crucial for its function in the formation of nucleic acids. The nitrogenous bases allow for specific base pairing (A-T or A-U, and G-C) which is essential for the accurate replication and transcription of genetic information. The pentose sugar and phosphate group form the backbone of the nucleic acid chain, providing structural stability and directionality. The phosphodiester bonds between the phosphate group of one nucleotide and the sugar of the next nucleotide create a strong, covalent linkage that holds the nucleic acid chain together.\n\nIn summary, the structure of a nucleotide, with its three components, is essential for the formation, stability, and function of nucleic acids such as DNA and RNA, which are responsible for storing and transmitting genetic information in living organisms."
