    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change (∆H°) for the precipitation reaction, we need to use the following equation:\n\n∆H° = ∑(∆H°f products) - ∑(∆H°f reactants)\n\nwhere ∆H°f represents the standard enthalpy of formation for each compound.\n\nFirst, let's write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nPb(NO3)2 (aq) + 2 KI (aq) → PbI2 (s) + 2 KNO3 (aq)\n\nNow, we need to find the standard enthalpies of formation (∆H°f) for each compound involved in the reaction. These values can be found in standard chemistry reference books or online databases. Here are the values for each compound:\n\n∆H°f [Pb(NO3)2 (aq)] = -437 kJ/mol\n∆H°f [KI (aq)] = -327 kJ/mol\n∆H°f [PbI2 (s)] = -278 kJ/mol\n∆H°f [KNO3 (aq)] = -494 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\n∆H° = [1 × (-278 kJ/mol) + 2 × (-494 kJ/mol)] - [1 × (-437 kJ/mol) + 2 × (-327 kJ/mol)]\n\n∆H° = (-278 - 988) - (-437 - 654)\n\n∆H° = (-1266) - (-1091)\n\n∆H° = -175 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change (∆H°) for the precipitation reaction between aqueous solutions of lead(II) nitrate and potassium iodide at 25°C is -175 kJ/mol."
