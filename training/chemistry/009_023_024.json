    "message_1": "What is the decay constant of a radioactive sample if after 3 hours, the initial activity of the sample decreased to 15% of its original value?",
    "message_2": "To find the decay constant, we can use the formula for radioactive decay:\n\nN(t) = N0 * e^(-λt)\n\nwhere N(t) is the activity at time t, N0 is the initial activity, λ is the decay constant, and t is the time elapsed.\n\nIn this case, after 3 hours, the activity has decreased to 15% of its original value. So, N(t) = 0.15 * N0, and t = 3 hours.\n\n0.15 * N0 = N0 * e^(-λ * 3)\n\nDivide both sides by N0:\n\n0.15 = e^(-λ * 3)\n\nNow, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(0.15) = -λ * 3\n\nSolve for λ:\n\nλ = -ln(0.15) / 3\n\nλ ≈ 0.3662 per hour\n\nSo, the decay constant is approximately 0.3662 per hour."
