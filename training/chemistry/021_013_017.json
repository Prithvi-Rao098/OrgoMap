    "message_2": "The Lewis structure for carbon dioxide (CO2) is as follows:\n\nO = C = O\n\nIn this structure, the carbon atom (C) is in the center and forms double bonds with each of the two oxygen atoms (O). The carbon atom has 4 valence electrons, while each oxygen atom has 6 valence electrons. By forming two double bonds, the carbon atom shares a total of 4 electrons with the oxygen atoms, and each oxygen atom shares 2 electrons with the carbon atom. This results in a full octet for each atom, satisfying the octet rule."
