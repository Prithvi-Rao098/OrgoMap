    "message_2": "First, we need to determine the limiting reactant. To do this, we'll find the moles of HCl and NaOH in the reaction.\n\nMoles of HCl = (concentration of HCl) × (volume of HCl solution)\nMoles of HCl = (0.100 mol/L) × (50.0 g / 1.00 g/mL) × (1 L / 1000 mL) = 0.00500 mol\n\nMoles of NaOH = (concentration of NaOH) × (volume of NaOH solution)\nMoles of NaOH = (0.200 mol/L) × (100.0 mL / 1000 mL/L) = 0.0200 mol\n\nSince the balanced chemical equation has a 1:1 ratio of HCl to NaOH, HCl is the limiting reactant.\n\nNext, we'll use Hess's Law to find the standard enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\n∆H° = [∆H°f(NaCl) + ∆H°f(H2O)] - [∆H°f(HCl) + ∆H°f(NaOH)]\n\nSince HCl and NaOH are strong acids and bases, we can assume their standard enthalpies of formation are approximately zero. Therefore, the equation simplifies to:\n\n∆H° = [∆H°f(NaCl) + ∆H°f(H2O)]\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values for the standard enthalpies of formation:\n\n∆H° = [(-407.3 kJ/mol) + (-285.8 kJ/mol)] = -693.1 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the neutralization reaction between hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide is -693.1 kJ/mol."
