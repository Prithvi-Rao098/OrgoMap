    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change of dissolving 5 grams of NaOH in 50 mL of water at 25°C, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the moles of NaOH.\n2. Calculate the enthalpy change using the enthalpy of solution.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the moles of NaOH\nThe molar mass of NaOH is 22.99 (Na) + 15.999 (O) + 1.007 (H) = 39.996 g/mol.\nSo, moles of NaOH = mass / molar mass = 5 g / 39.996 g/mol = 0.125 mol\n\nStep 2: Calculate the enthalpy change using the enthalpy of solution\nEnthalpy change = moles of NaOH * enthalpy of solution\nEnthalpy change = 0.125 mol * (-44.51 kJ/mol) = -5.56 kJ\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy change of dissolving 5 grams of NaOH in 50 mL of water at 25°C is -5.56 kJ."
