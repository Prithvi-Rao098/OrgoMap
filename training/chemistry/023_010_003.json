    "message_2": "To determine the theoretical yield of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, we first need to find the limiting reactant in the reaction between hydrazine (N2H4) and 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (C6H3ClN2O4). The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nC6H3ClN2O4 + N2H4 → C6H3N4O4 + HCl\n\nNext, we need to find the moles of each reactant:\n\nMoles of hydrazine (N2H4) = mass / molar mass = 5 g / (32.05 g/mol) = 0.1559 mol\nMoles of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (C6H3ClN2O4) = mass / molar mass = 10 g / (202.56 g/mol) = 0.0494 mol\n\nNow, we need to find the mole ratio of the reactants:\n\nMole ratio = moles of N2H4 / moles of C6H3ClN2O4 = 0.1559 mol / 0.0494 mol = 3.16\n\nSince the mole ratio is greater than 1, it means that hydrazine (N2H4) is in excess, and 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (C6H3ClN2O4) is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow, we can find the theoretical yield of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (C6H3N4O4):\n\nMoles of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine = moles of limiting reactant (C6H3ClN2O4) = 0.0494 mol\n\nMass of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine = moles × molar mass = 0.0494 mol × (198.11 g/mol) = 9.79 g\n\nTherefore, the theoretical yield of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine is 9.79 grams."
