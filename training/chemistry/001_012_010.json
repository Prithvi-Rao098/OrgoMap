    "message_2": "When an amine reacts with an acid anhydride, an amide is formed as the product. Here's a general balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nR-NH2 + (R'CO)2O â†’ R-NH-CO-R' + R'COOH\n\nwhere R and R' are alkyl or aryl groups.\n\nThe product obtained is an amide, specifically an N-substituted amide, and a carboxylic acid."
