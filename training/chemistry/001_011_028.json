    "message_2": "When ethanoic acid (CH₃COOH) reacts with excess ethanol (C₂H₅OH) in the presence of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) as a catalyst, an esterification reaction occurs. The product formed is ethyl ethanoate (CH₃COOC₂H₅), also known as ethyl acetate, and water (H₂O). The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nCH₃COOH + C₂H₅OH ⇌ CH₃COOC₂H₅ + H₂O\n\nMechanism:\n1. Protonation of the carbonyl oxygen: The sulfuric acid donates a proton (H⁺) to the carbonyl oxygen of ethanoic acid, making it more electrophilic.\n\nCH₃COOH + H⁺ → CH₃C(OH)OOH\n\n2. Nucleophilic attack: The oxygen atom of ethanol, acting as a nucleophile, attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the protonated ethanoic acid, forming a tetrahedral intermediate.\n\nCH₃C(OH)OOH + C₂H₅OH → CH₃C(OH)(OC₂H₅)OOH\n\n3. Proton transfer: A proton is transferred from the hydroxyl group (OH) to the oxygen atom of the ethanoxy group (OC₂H₅).\n\nCH₃C(OH)(OC₂H₅)OOH → CH₃C(O)(OC₂H₅)OH₂\n\n4. Elimination of water: The protonated ethanoxy group leaves as a water molecule, generating a carbocation.\n\nCH₃C(O)(OC₂H₅)OH₂ → CH₃C⁺(OC₂H₅) + H₂O\n\n5. Deprotonation: The carbocation is deprotonated by a nearby base (such as the conjugate base of sulfuric acid, HSO₄⁻), forming the final product, ethyl ethanoate.\n\nCH₃C⁺(OC₂H₅) + HSO₄⁻ → CH₃COOC₂H₅ + H₂SO₄\n\nThe reaction is reversible, and the position of the equilibrium can be shifted towards the products by using an excess of ethanol or by continuously removing the water formed during the reaction."
