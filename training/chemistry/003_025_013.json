If the equilibrium constant value is 4.7 x 10^-3 for this reaction at the temperature given, what is the equilibrium concentration of SO2 if the initial concentration of SO2 is 0.025 M and the initial concentration of O2 is 0.010 M?",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant expression for the given reaction, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation:\n\n2 SO2 (g) + O2 (g) ⇌ 2 SO3 (g)\n\nNow, we can write the equilibrium constant expression (Kc) for this reaction:\n\nKc = [SO3]^2 / ([SO2]^2 * [O2])\n\nWe are given that Kc = 4.7 x 10^-3 at the given temperature.\n\nLet's denote the change in concentration of SO2, O2, and SO3 at equilibrium as x. Since 2 moles of SO2 react with 1 mole of O2 to form 2 moles of SO3, the changes in their concentrations at equilibrium can be represented as:\n\n[SO2] = 0.025 - 2x\n[O2] = 0.010 - x\n[SO3] = 2x\n\nNow, we can substitute these expressions into the Kc expression:\n\n4.7 x 10^-3 = (2x)^2 / ((0.025 - 2x)^2 * (0.010 - x))\n\nSolving this equation for x will give us the change in concentration at equilibrium, and then we can find the equilibrium concentration of SO2.\n\n4.7 x 10^-3 = (4x^2) / ((0.025^2 - 0.050x + 4x^2) * (0.010 - x))\n\nTo simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by the denominator:\n\n(4x^2) * (0.025^2 - 0.050x + 4x^2) * (0.010 - x) = 4.7 x 10^-3\n\nNow, we can use a numerical method or iterative approach to solve for x. After solving for x, we get:\n\nx ≈ 0.0023\n\nNow, we can find the equilibrium concentration of SO2:\n\n[SO2] = 0.025 - 2x\n[SO2] = 0.025 - 2(0.0023)\n[SO2] ≈ 0.0204 M\n\nSo, the equilibrium concentration of SO2 is approximately 0.0204 M."
