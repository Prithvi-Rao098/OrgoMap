Calculate the equilibrium concentrations of hydrogen, nitrogen, and ammonia if the Kc value of the reaction at this temperature is 1.5 x 10^-2.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium concentrations of hydrogen, nitrogen, and ammonia, we will use the initial concentrations and the Kc value given.\n\nInitial concentrations:\n[H2] = 0.1 mol / 2 L = 0.05 M\n[N2] = 0.2 mol / 2 L = 0.1 M\n[NH3] = 0 since no ammonia is present initially\n\nLet x be the change in concentration at equilibrium:\n[H2] = 0.05 - x\n[N2] = 0.1 - x\n[NH3] = 2x\n\nNow, we can write the expression for Kc:\n\nKc = [NH3]^2 / ([H2] * [N2])\n\nPlug in the equilibrium concentrations and the given Kc value:\n\n1.5 x 10^-2 = (2x)^2 / ((0.05 - x) * (0.1 - x))\n\nNow, we need to solve for x:\n\n(1.5 x 10^-2) * ((0.05 - x) * (0.1 - x)) = (2x)^2\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx ≈ 0.014\n\nNow, we can find the equilibrium concentrations:\n\n[H2] = 0.05 - x ≈ 0.05 - 0.014 ≈ 0.036 M\n[N2] = 0.1 - x ≈ 0.1 - 0.014 ≈ 0.086 M\n[NH3] = 2x ≈ 2 * 0.014 ≈ 0.028 M\n\nSo, the equilibrium concentrations are approximately:\n[H2] ≈ 0.036 M\n[N2] ≈ 0.086 M\n[NH3] ≈ 0.028 M"
