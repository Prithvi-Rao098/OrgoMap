    "message_2": "To calculate the pH of the solution, we first need to determine the concentration of the hydrochloric acid (HCl) in moles per liter (M).\n\nWe have 0.02 moles of HCl in 500 mL of water. To convert the volume to liters, we divide by 1000:\n\n500 mL / 1000 = 0.5 L\n\nNow, we can calculate the concentration of HCl:\n\n0.02 moles / 0.5 L = 0.04 M\n\nSince HCl is a strong acid, it will dissociate completely in water, producing an equal concentration of H+ ions:\n\n[H+] = 0.04 M\n\nNow, we can calculate the pH using the formula:\n\npH = -log10[H+]\n\npH = -log10(0.04)\n\npH â‰ˆ 1.4\n\nSo, the pH of the solution is approximately 1.4."
