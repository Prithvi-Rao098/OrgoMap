Use Hess's Law to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Hess's Law, we need to find a series of reactions that add up to the overall reaction we are interested in. The overall reaction is:\n\n2CO(g) + O2(g) → 2CO2(g)\n\nWe are given two reactions:\n\n1) Decomposition of 2 moles of carbon dioxide to 2 moles of carbon monoxide and 1 mole of oxygen gas:\n2CO2(g) → 2CO(g) + O2(g)    ΔH1 = -566 kJ/mol\n\n2) Combustion of 1 mole of carbon to form carbon dioxide gas:\nC(s) + O2(g) → CO2(g)    ΔH2 = -394 kJ/mol\n\nWe can manipulate these reactions to add up to the overall reaction. First, we need to reverse reaction 1:\n\n2CO(g) + O2(g) → 2CO2(g)    ΔH1' = 566 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we need to multiply reaction 2 by 2 to match the number of moles of CO2 in the overall reaction:\n\n2C(s) + 2O2(g) → 2CO2(g)    ΔH2' = -788 kJ/mol\n\nHowever, we need to get rid of the 2 moles of carbon in reaction 2. We can do this by adding the following reaction:\n\n2C(s) → 2CO(g)    ΔH3 = 2 * ΔH_formation_of_CO\n\nNow, we can add reactions 1', 2', and 3 to get the overall reaction:\n\n2CO(g) + O2(g) → 2CO2(g)    ΔH_total = ΔH1' + ΔH2' + ΔH3\n\nTo find ΔH3, we can use the fact that ΔH_formation_of_CO = ΔH_formation_of_CO2 - ΔH_combustion_of_C:\n\nΔH_formation_of_CO = (-394 kJ/mol) - (-566 kJ/mol) = 172 kJ/mol\n\nSo, ΔH3 = 2 * ΔH_formation_of_CO = 2 * 172 kJ/mol = 344 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can find ΔH_total:\n\nΔH_total = 566 kJ/mol - 788 kJ/mol + 344 kJ/mol = 122 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change of the reaction of 2 moles of carbon monoxide and 1 mole of oxygen gas to form 2 moles of carbon dioxide gas is 122 kJ/mol."
