    "message_2": "The bond angle between the two hydrogen atoms in a water molecule is approximately 104.5 degrees. This angle is a result of the molecular geometry of water, which is bent or V-shaped due to the presence of two lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen atom.\n\nThe molecular geometry of water significantly affects its properties. The bent shape and the presence of lone pairs on the oxygen atom create an unequal distribution of electron density, making water a polar molecule. This polarity leads to hydrogen bonding between water molecules, which is responsible for many of its unique properties, such as:\n\n1. High boiling and melting points: The hydrogen bonds between water molecules require more energy to break, resulting in higher boiling and melting points compared to other molecules of similar size and weight.\n\n2. High heat capacity: Water can absorb a large amount of heat without a significant increase in temperature due to the energy required to break hydrogen bonds. This property helps regulate temperature in living organisms and the environment.\n\n3. High surface tension: The hydrogen bonding between water molecules creates a strong cohesive force, leading to a high surface tension. This property allows water to form droplets and enables some insects to walk on water.\n\n4. Excellent solvent: The polarity of water allows it to dissolve a wide range of substances, including salts, sugars, and gases. This property makes water an essential medium for chemical reactions in living organisms and the environment.\n\n5. Lower density of ice: When water freezes, the hydrogen bonds form a hexagonal lattice structure, which is less dense than liquid water. This causes ice to float on water, providing insulation for aquatic life in cold environments."
