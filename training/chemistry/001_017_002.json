    "message_2": "In the molecule formaldehyde (CH2O), the oxidation state of carbon can be determined by assigning oxidation numbers to each atom in the molecule. Hydrogen has an oxidation number of +1, and oxygen has an oxidation number of -2. \n\nThe molecule can be represented as:\nC + 2(H) + O = 0\n\nLet the oxidation state of carbon be x. Then, the equation becomes:\nx + 2(+1) + (-2) = 0\nx + 2 - 2 = 0\nx = 0\n\nSo, the oxidation state of carbon in formaldehyde is 0.\n\nNow, let's identify the elements being reduced and oxidized in the following reaction:\n2CH3OH + 3O2 → 2CO2 + 4H2O\n\nFirst, assign oxidation numbers to each element in the reactants and products:\n\nCH3OH: C (-2), H (+1), O (-2)\nO2: O (0)\nCO2: C (+4), O (-2)\nH2O: H (+1), O (-2)\n\nComparing the oxidation numbers of the elements in the reactants and products:\n\n1. Carbon in CH3OH goes from -2 to +4, which means it loses electrons. This is an oxidation process. So, carbon is being oxidized.\n\n2. Oxygen in O2 goes from 0 to -2, which means it gains electrons. This is a reduction process. So, oxygen is being reduced."
