    "message_1": "Suppose you start with a known amount of a radioactive substance that has a half-life of 8 days. After 24 days, only 1/8th of the initial quantity remains. What was the initial amount of the radioactive substance?",
    "message_2": "To find the initial amount of the radioactive substance, we can use the formula for radioactive decay:\n\nFinal amount = Initial amount * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nLet's denote the initial amount as \"A\" and the final amount as \"1/8A\" since only 1/8th of the initial quantity remains after 24 days.\n\n1/8A = A * (1/2)^(24 / 8)\n\nNow, we can solve for A:\n\n1/8A = A * (1/2)^3\n1/8A = A * (1/8)\n\nDivide both sides by (1/8):\n\nA = A\n\nThis equation tells us that any initial amount \"A\" of the radioactive substance would result in 1/8th of that amount remaining after 24 days, due to the half-life of 8 days. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact initial amount of the radioactive substance without more information."
