    "message_2": "To calculate the formal charge of the nitrogen atom in HNO3, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the number of valence electrons for nitrogen. Nitrogen is in group 15, so it has 5 valence electrons.\n\n2. Calculate the number of non-bonding electrons. In HNO3, nitrogen is bonded to one hydrogen atom and two oxygen atoms. There are no lone pairs on the nitrogen atom, so the number of non-bonding electrons is 0.\n\n3. Calculate the number of bonding electrons. Nitrogen forms one single bond with hydrogen and two single bonds with oxygen atoms. Each single bond consists of 2 electrons, so there are a total of 6 bonding electrons.\n\n4. Calculate the formal charge using the formula: Formal charge = (Valence electrons) - (Non-bonding electrons) - (1/2 * Bonding electrons)\n\nFormal charge of nitrogen = (5) - (0) - (1/2 * 6) = 5 - 3 = +2\n\nSo, the formal charge of the nitrogen atom in HNO3 is +2."
