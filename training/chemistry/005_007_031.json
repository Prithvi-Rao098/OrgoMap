    "message_2": "The sequence of nucleotides in DNA determines the amino acid sequence of a protein through a two-step process: transcription and translation. These processes involve the conversion of DNA information into RNA and then into a protein.\n\n1. Transcription: Transcription is the process by which the genetic information stored in DNA is copied into a molecule of messenger RNA (mRNA). This process occurs in the nucleus of the cell and is carried out by the enzyme RNA polymerase. The RNA polymerase binds to a specific region of the DNA called the promoter and unwinds the DNA strands. It then reads the DNA template strand in the 3' to 5' direction and synthesizes a complementary mRNA strand in the 5' to 3' direction. The mRNA is built using the DNA sequence as a template, with the nucleotide bases adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T) in DNA being transcribed into the bases adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and uracil (U) in mRNA.\n\n2. Translation: Translation is the process by which the mRNA sequence is read by ribosomes to synthesize a protein. This process occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell. The mRNA sequence is read in groups of three nucleotides called codons. Each codon corresponds to a specific amino acid, which is the building block of proteins. The genetic code is a set of rules that defines how the nucleotide sequence of mRNA is translated into the amino acid sequence of a protein. There are 64 possible codons, and most of them code for one of the 20 amino acids, while some serve as start or stop signals for translation.\n\nTransfer RNA (tRNA) molecules play a crucial role in translation. Each tRNA molecule has a specific anticodon sequence that is complementary to a codon on the mRNA and carries the corresponding amino acid. During translation, the ribosome binds to the mRNA and reads the codons. The tRNA molecules with the matching anticodons bind to the mRNA codons, bringing the appropriate amino acids. The ribosome then forms a peptide bond between the adjacent amino acids, and the tRNA molecules are released. This process continues until a stop codon is reached, signaling the end of translation. The newly synthesized polypeptide chain (protein) is then released and undergoes further modifications and folding to become a functional protein.\n\nIn summary, the sequence of nucleotides in DNA determines the amino acid sequence of a protein by first being transcribed into mRNA, which is then translated into a protein by ribosomes using the genetic code. The specific order of codons in the mRNA dictates the order of amino acids in the protein, ultimately determining its structure and function."
