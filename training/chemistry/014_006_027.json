    "message_2": "The complex formed by the reaction of copper (II) ions with ethylenediamine in a 1:2 stoichiometric ratio is called bis(ethylenediamine)copper(II) complex. Its chemical formula is [Cu(en)2]^2+, where en represents ethylenediamine.\n\nThe shape of this complex is square planar, as copper(II) complexes with d8 electron configuration tend to adopt this geometry. Regarding isomerism, since the ethylenediamine ligand is symmetrical, there are no geometrical isomers (cis or trans) for this complex. Additionally, there is no optical isomerism in this complex, as it does not have a non-superimposable mirror image (it is not chiral)."
