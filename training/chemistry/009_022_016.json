    "message_2": "As a chemist, I can provide you with some general information, but determining the correct radiation dosage for a patient is a task for a radiation oncologist or a medical physicist. They will consider various factors, such as the size and location of the tumor, the type of cancer, and the patient's overall health.\n\nThe goal of radiation therapy is to deliver the maximum dose of radiation to the tumor while minimizing the dose to the surrounding healthy tissue. To achieve this, radiation oncologists use a concept called \"tumor dose conformity,\" which means that the radiation dose is conformed to the shape and size of the tumor.\n\nTo calculate the radiation dosage, medical professionals use a treatment planning system (TPS) that takes into account the patient's CT or MRI scans, the type of radiation (e.g., X-rays, gamma rays, or charged particles), and the radiation delivery method (e.g., external beam radiation therapy or brachytherapy). The TPS calculates the optimal radiation dose distribution based on these factors and the dose constraints for the surrounding healthy tissues and organs.\n\nThe minimum and maximum radiation doses for healthy tissue depend on the specific tissue type and the patient's individual tolerance. For example, the lung has a relatively low tolerance for radiation, with a maximum dose constraint of around 20 Gy (Gray) for the total lung volume receiving radiation. However, this value may vary depending on the patient and the specific treatment plan.\n\nIn conclusion, determining the correct radiation dosage for a patient with a lung tumor requires the expertise of a radiation oncologist or a medical physicist, who will consider various factors and use a treatment planning system to calculate the optimal dose distribution."
