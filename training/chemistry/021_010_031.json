    "message_2": "The bond enthalpy of a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O) in carbon dioxide (CO2) is approximately 799 kJ/mol. This value represents the energy required to break one mole of C=O double bonds in CO2. Keep in mind that this value may vary slightly depending on the source and experimental conditions."
