    "message_2": "Nucleophilic substitution reactions in halogenoalkanes involve the replacement of a halogen atom (leaving group) by a nucleophile. The mechanism of nucleophilic substitution can occur through two different pathways: SN1 (Substitution Nucleophilic Unimolecular) and SN2 (Substitution Nucleophilic Bimolecular). The choice of the pathway depends on the structure of the halogenoalkane and the reaction conditions.\n\nIn both mechanisms, the nucleophile plays a crucial role in the reaction, as it donates a pair of electrons to form a new bond with the electrophilic carbon atom, while the leaving group departs with the electron pair from the carbon-leaving group bond.\n\nSN1 Mechanism:\n1. Formation of a carbocation intermediate: The leaving group (halogen atom) departs from the carbon atom, resulting in the formation of a carbocation intermediate. This step is slow and rate-determining.\n2. Nucleophilic attack: The nucleophile attacks the carbocation, donating a pair of electrons and forming a new bond with the electrophilic carbon atom. This step is fast.\n\nSN2 Mechanism:\n1. Concerted nucleophilic attack and leaving group departure: The nucleophile attacks the electrophilic carbon atom from the opposite side of the leaving group, simultaneously donating a pair of electrons to form a new bond while the leaving group departs with the electron pair from the carbon-leaving group bond. This step is a single concerted process and is the rate-determining step.\n\nExample of a nucleophilic substitution reaction:\nConsider the reaction of bromoethane (CH3CH2Br) with hydroxide ions (OH-).\n\n1. In the SN2 mechanism, the hydroxide ion (nucleophile) attacks the electrophilic carbon atom (bearing the bromine atom) from the opposite side of the leaving group (Br-).\n2. The bromine atom departs with the electron pair from the carbon-bromine bond, while the hydroxide ion forms a new bond with the carbon atom.\n3. The product formed is ethanol (CH3CH2OH).\n\nIn summary, nucleophilic substitution reactions in halogenoalkanes involve the replacement of a halogen atom (leaving group) by a nucleophile through either an SN1 or SN2 mechanism. The nucleophile donates a pair of electrons to form a new bond with the electrophilic carbon atom, while the leaving group departs with the electron pair from the carbon-leaving group bond."
