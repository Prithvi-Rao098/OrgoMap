    "message_2": "To calculate the lattice energy of sodium chloride (NaCl), we can use the Coulomb's Law formula:\n\nLattice Energy = (k * q1 * q2) / r\n\nwhere:\nk = Coulomb's constant (8.9875517923 × 10^9 N m^2 C^-2)\nq1 = charge on the sodium ion (+1)\nq2 = charge on the chloride ion (-1)\nr = distance between the ions (2.82 Å)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the distance from angstroms (Å) to meters (m):\n\n1 Å = 1 × 10^-10 m\n2.82 Å = 2.82 × 10^-10 m\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nLattice Energy = (8.9875517923 × 10^9 N m^2 C^-2) * (+1 C) * (-1 C) / (2.82 × 10^-10 m)\n\nLattice Energy = -8.9875517923 × 10^9 N m^2 C^-2 / 2.82 × 10^-10 m\n\nLattice Energy = -3.189 × 10^9 N m C^-2\n\nThe lattice energy of sodium chloride (NaCl) is approximately -3.189 × 10^9 N m C^-2. Note that the negative sign indicates that the energy is released when the ions come together to form the lattice structure."
