    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the reaction, we can use Hess's Law, which states that the total enthalpy change for a reaction is the sum of the enthalpy changes for each step in the reaction. In this case, we can use the standard enthalpy of formation values (ΔHf°) for the reactants and products.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation is:\n\n2SO2(g) + O2(g) -> 2SO3(g)\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the reaction (ΔH°) can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nΔH° = Σ [ΔHf° (products)] - Σ [ΔHf° (reactants)]\n\nFor the products (2 moles of SO3), we have:\n\n2 * ΔHf° [SO3(g)] = 2 * (-395.72 kJ/mol) = -791.44 kJ\n\nFor the reactants (2 moles of SO2 and 1 mole of O2), we have:\n\n2 * ΔHf° [SO2(g)] + ΔHf° [O2(g)] = 2 * (-296.83 kJ/mol) + 0 kJ/mol = -593.66 kJ\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nΔH° = (-791.44 kJ) - (-593.66 kJ) = -197.78 kJ\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change for the reaction of sulfur dioxide gas and oxygen gas to form sulfur trioxide gas is -197.78 kJ."
