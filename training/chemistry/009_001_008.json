    "message_1": "A sample of 20 grams of a radioactive isotope has a half-life of 5 days. After 15 days, how much of the isotope is left in the sample and how much has decayed? Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for radioactive decay:\n\nremaining_amount = initial_amount * (1/2)^(time_elapsed / half_life)\n\nwhere remaining_amount is the amount of the isotope left after the time_elapsed, initial_amount is the starting amount of the isotope, time_elapsed is the time that has passed, and half_life is the half-life of the isotope.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\ninitial_amount = 20 grams\nhalf_life = 5 days\ntime_elapsed = 15 days\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nremaining_amount = 20 * (1/2)^(15 / 5)\nremaining_amount = 20 * (1/2)^3\nremaining_amount = 20 * (1/8)\nremaining_amount = 20 * 0.125\nremaining_amount = 2.5 grams\n\nSo, after 15 days, there are 2.5 grams of the radioactive isotope left in the sample.\n\nTo find out how much has decayed, we can subtract the remaining amount from the initial amount:\n\ndecayed_amount = initial_amount - remaining_amount\ndecayed_amount = 20 - 2.5\ndecayed_amount = 17.5 grams\n\nTherefore, 17.5 grams of the isotope has decayed after 15 days."
