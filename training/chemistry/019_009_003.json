    "message_2": "First, we need to determine the overall redox reaction and the number of moles of electrons transferred (n). We can do this by combining the given half-reactions:\n\nCu2+(aq) + 2e- → Cu(s)  (Reduction half-reaction, E° = +0.34V)\nAg+(aq) + e- → Ag(s)  (Reduction half-reaction, E° = +0.80V)\n\nTo combine these half-reactions, we need to multiply the second half-reaction by 2 to balance the number of electrons:\n\n2(Ag+(aq) + e- → Ag(s)) → 2Ag+(aq) + 2e- → 2Ag(s)\n\nNow we can add the two half-reactions:\n\nCu2+(aq) + 2e- + 2Ag+(aq) + 2e- → Cu(s) + 2Ag(s) + 2e-\n\nCancel out the electrons:\n\nCu2+(aq) + 2Ag+(aq) → Cu(s) + 2Ag(s)\n\nNow we have the overall redox reaction:\n\nCu(s) + 2Ag+(aq) → Cu2+(aq) + 2Ag(s)\n\nThe number of moles of electrons transferred (n) is 2.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the difference in standard reduction potentials (ΔE°). Since both half-reactions are written as reductions, we need to reverse the first half-reaction to make it an oxidation:\n\nCu(s) → Cu2+(aq) + 2e- (Oxidation half-reaction, E° = -0.34V)\n\nNow we can calculate ΔE°:\n\nΔE° = E°(reduction) - E°(oxidation) = 0.80V - (-0.34V) = 1.14V\n\nFinally, we can calculate the standard free energy change (ΔG°) using the formula:\n\nΔG° = -nFΔE°\n\nΔG° = -2 * 96,485 C/mol * 1.14V\n\nΔG° = -219,663.8 J/mol\n\nThe standard free energy change for the redox reaction under standard conditions is -219,663.8 J/mol."
