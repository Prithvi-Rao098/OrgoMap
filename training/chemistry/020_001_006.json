    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction, we can use the expression:\n\nKc = [NO]^2 * [Cl2] / [NOCl]^2\n\nGiven the concentrations of the reactants and products at equilibrium:\n\n[NOCl] = 0.20 M\n[NO] = 0.15 M\n[Cl2] = 0.10 M\n\nPlug these values into the Kc expression:\n\nKc = (0.15)^2 * (0.10) / (0.20)^2\n\nKc = 0.0225 * 0.10 / 0.04\n\nKc = 0.05625\n\nThe equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction at 25°C is approximately 0.056."
