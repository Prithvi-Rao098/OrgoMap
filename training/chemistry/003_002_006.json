    "message_2": "At a pressure of 1 atm, ice and water are in equilibrium at 0°C (32°F).\n\nTo calculate the amount of heat required to melt 100 g of ice at this temperature, we first need to determine the number of moles of ice. The molar mass of water is 18.015 g/mol.\n\nNumber of moles = (mass of ice) / (molar mass of water)\nNumber of moles = 100 g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ 5.55 mol\n\nNow, we can use the heat of fusion for water (6.01 kJ/mol) to calculate the amount of heat required to melt the ice.\n\nHeat required = (number of moles) × (heat of fusion)\nHeat required = 5.55 mol × 6.01 kJ/mol ≈ 33.36 kJ\n\nSince 1 kJ = 1000 J, the heat required to melt 100 g of ice at 0°C and 1 atm pressure is:\n\n33.36 kJ × 1000 J/kJ = 33,360 J"
