    "message_1": "A compound containing only potassium and chlorine has a mass of 74.55 grams. When this compound was analyzed, it was found to have 37.43 grams of potassium and 37.12 grams of chlorine. Determine the empirical and molecular formulas of this compound.",
    "message_2": "To determine the empirical formula of the compound, we need to find the mole ratio of potassium (K) to chlorine (Cl).\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of each element:\n\n1. Moles of potassium (K):\nPotassium has a molar mass of 39.10 g/mol.\nMoles of K = mass of K / molar mass of K\nMoles of K = 37.43 g / 39.10 g/mol = 0.957 moles\n\n2. Moles of chlorine (Cl):\nChlorine has a molar mass of 35.45 g/mol.\nMoles of Cl = mass of Cl / molar mass of Cl\nMoles of Cl = 37.12 g / 35.45 g/mol = 1.047 moles\n\nNow, we need to find the mole ratio of K to Cl:\n\nMole ratio of K:Cl = moles of K / moles of Cl\nMole ratio of K:Cl = 0.957 / 1.047 â‰ˆ 1:1\n\nSince the mole ratio is approximately 1:1, the empirical formula of the compound is KCl.\n\nTo find the molecular formula, we need to determine the molar mass of the compound:\n\nMolar mass of KCl = molar mass of K + molar mass of Cl\nMolar mass of KCl = 39.10 g/mol + 35.45 g/mol = 74.55 g/mol\n\nSince the molar mass of the compound (74.55 g/mol) is equal to the molar mass of the empirical formula (KCl), the molecular formula is also KCl."
