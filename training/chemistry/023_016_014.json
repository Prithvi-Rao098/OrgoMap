    "message_2": "The preparation of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline from aniline and chlorine gas via the intermediate formation of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene can be achieved through the following step-wise mechanism:\n\nStep 1: Nitration of Aniline\nAniline (C6H5NH2) is first nitrated to form 4-nitroaniline (C6H4(NO2)NH2). This is done by treating aniline with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4). The nitronium ion (NO2+) generated from the reaction between HNO3 and H2SO4 acts as an electrophile, attacking the aniline molecule at the para position.\n\nStep 2: Acetylation of 4-Nitroaniline\n4-Nitroaniline is then acetylated to form N-acetyl-4-nitroaniline (C6H4(NO2)NHCOCH3). This is done by treating 4-nitroaniline with acetic anhydride (CH3CO)2O. The acetyl group (CH3CO) acts as a protecting group for the amino group, preventing it from reacting in the next step.\n\nStep 3: Chlorination of N-acetyl-4-nitroaniline\nN-acetyl-4-nitroaniline is then chlorinated to form 2,4-dichloro-N-acetyl-nitrobenzene (C6H3(NO2)Cl2NHCOCH3). This is done by treating N-acetyl-4-nitroaniline with chlorine gas (Cl2) in the presence of a catalyst, such as ferric chloride (FeCl3). The chlorine molecules act as electrophiles, attacking the N-acetyl-4-nitroaniline molecule at the ortho and para positions.\n\nStep 4: Hydrolysis of 2,4-dichloro-N-acetyl-nitrobenzene\n2,4-dichloro-N-acetyl-nitrobenzene is then hydrolyzed to form 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene (C6H3(NO2)Cl2) and acetic acid (CH3COOH). This is done by treating 2,4-dichloro-N-acetyl-nitrobenzene with water (H2O) and a base, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n\nStep 5: Reduction of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene\n2,4-dichloronitrobenzene is then reduced to form 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline (C6H4(NO2)ClNH2). This is done by treating 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene with a reducing agent, such as iron (Fe) and hydrochloric acid (HCl), or sodium sulfide (Na2S) and ammonium chloride (NH4Cl). The nitro group (NO2) is reduced to an amino group (NH2), while one of the chlorine atoms remains attached to the benzene ring.\n\nThe final product is 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline (C6H4(NO2)ClNH2)."
