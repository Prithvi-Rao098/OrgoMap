The cell is operated for 8 hours and consumes a total of 2400 Coulombs of charge. What is the efficiency of this electrochemical cell?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the efficiency of the voltaic cell, we need to determine the actual work done by the cell and compare it to the theoretical maximum work that could be done.\n\nFirst, let's find the actual work done by the cell. Work is equal to the charge (Q) multiplied by the potential difference (V):\n\nActual work = Q × V\nActual work = 2400 C × 0.78 V\nActual work = 1872 Joules\n\nNext, let's find the theoretical maximum work that could be done. We know that the cell produces a current of 2.5 A and operates for 8 hours. First, we need to convert the time to seconds:\n\n8 hours × (3600 seconds/hour) = 28800 seconds\n\nNow, we can find the total charge that could be produced by the cell:\n\nQ_theoretical = Current × Time\nQ_theoretical = 2.5 A × 28800 s\nQ_theoretical = 72000 Coulombs\n\nThe theoretical maximum work is then:\n\nTheoretical work = Q_theoretical × V\nTheoretical work = 72000 C × 0.78 V\nTheoretical work = 56160 Joules\n\nNow we can calculate the efficiency of the cell:\n\nEfficiency = (Actual work / Theoretical work) × 100%\nEfficiency = (1872 J / 56160 J) × 100%\nEfficiency ≈ 3.33%\n\nThe efficiency of this electrochemical cell is approximately 3.33%."
