    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change of neutralization (ΔH) for the reaction between HCl and NaOH, we can use the formula:\n\nΔH = -q / n\n\nwhere q is the heat released during the reaction and n is the number of moles of the limiting reactant.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the limiting reactant. Since both solutions have the same volume (50 mL) and concentration (1 M), they have the same number of moles:\n\nmoles of HCl = moles of NaOH = volume × concentration = 50 mL × 1 mol/L = 0.050 mol\n\nSince both reactants have the same number of moles, neither is limiting.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the heat released (q) during the reaction. We can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere m is the mass of the solution, c is the specific heat capacity of the solution, and ΔT is the temperature change. Assuming the solution is mostly water, we can use the specific heat capacity of water, which is 4.18 J/g°C. The total volume of the solution is 100 mL, and since the density of water is approximately 1 g/mL, the mass of the solution is approximately 100 g.\n\nq = (100 g)(4.18 J/g°C)(10°C) = 4180 J\n\nNow we can calculate the standard enthalpy change of neutralization:\n\nΔH = -q / n = -4180 J / 0.050 mol = -83600 J/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change of neutralization for the reaction between HCl and NaOH is approximately -83.6 kJ/mol."
