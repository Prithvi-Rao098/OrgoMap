    "message_2": "To determine the pH of a 0.01 M hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution, we can use the formula:\n\npH = -log10[H+]\n\nSince HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely in water, meaning that the concentration of H+ ions is equal to the concentration of HCl. In this case, the concentration of H+ ions is 0.01 M.\n\nNow, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\npH = -log10(0.01)\npH = -(-2)\npH = 2\n\nSo, the pH of the 0.01 M HCl solution is 2. However, since the pH meter has a sensitivity of 0.01 pH, the measured pH value could range from 1.99 to 2.01."
