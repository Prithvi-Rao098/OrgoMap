    "message_2": "As a chemist, I can provide you with some general information about radiation therapy, but it's important to note that I am not a medical professional. The minimum dose of radiation needed to effectively treat a tumor with radiation therapy depends on various factors, such as the type and size of the tumor, its location, and the patient's overall health.\n\nRadiation therapy is typically measured in units called grays (Gy). The total dose of radiation required for effective treatment can range from 20 Gy to 70 Gy or more, depending on the specific case. This dose is usually divided into smaller doses called fractions, which are administered over several weeks.\n\nThe dose of radiation plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of the treatment. A higher dose of radiation is generally more effective in killing cancer cells, but it also increases the risk of side effects and damage to healthy tissues surrounding the tumor. Therefore, radiation oncologists carefully plan the treatment to deliver the optimal dose of radiation to the tumor while minimizing the exposure to healthy tissues.\n\nIt's important to consult with a radiation oncologist or a medical professional to determine the appropriate dose of radiation for a specific case, as they will take into account all the relevant factors and tailor the treatment plan accordingly."
