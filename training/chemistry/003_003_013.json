    "message_1": "What is the rate constant (k) of a first-order reaction that has a half-life (t1/2) of 60 seconds and an initial concentration [A]0 of 0.10 M?",
    "message_2": "To find the rate constant (k) of a first-order reaction, we can use the relationship between the half-life (t1/2) and the rate constant. The formula for the half-life of a first-order reaction is:\n\nt1/2 = 0.693 / k\n\nWe are given the half-life (t1/2) as 60 seconds. We can rearrange the formula to solve for the rate constant (k):\n\nk = 0.693 / t1/2\n\nNow, we can plug in the given half-life value:\n\nk = 0.693 / 60 s\n\nk ≈ 0.01155 s⁻¹\n\nThe rate constant (k) for this first-order reaction is approximately 0.01155 s⁻¹. Note that the initial concentration [A]0 is not needed to calculate the rate constant in this case, as it does not affect the half-life or rate constant for a first-order reaction."
