    "message_2": "When 2-methylcyclohexanol undergoes an E1 elimination reaction with concentrated sulfuric acid, the major organic product formed is 1-methylcyclohexene. Here's the mechanism of the reaction:\n\n1. Protonation of the alcohol: The oxygen atom of the hydroxyl group (-OH) in 2-methylcyclohexanol is protonated by the sulfuric acid (H2SO4), forming a good leaving group (water) and a carbocation intermediate.\n2-methylcyclohexanol + H2SO4 -> [2-methylcyclohexyl-OH2]+ + HSO4-\n\n2. Formation of the carbocation intermediate: The water molecule leaves, generating a carbocation intermediate at the 2-position of the cyclohexane ring.\n[2-methylcyclohexyl-OH2]+ -> [2-methylcyclohexyl]+ + H2O\n\n3. 1,2-hydride shift: A hydride shift occurs, moving a hydrogen atom from the 1-position to the 2-position, resulting in a more stable tertiary carbocation at the 1-position.\n[2-methylcyclohexyl]+ -> [1-methylcyclohexyl]+\n\n4. Elimination of a proton: A base (HSO4-) abstracts a proton from an adjacent carbon atom, forming a double bond and generating the final product, 1-methylcyclohexene.\n[1-methylcyclohexyl]+ + HSO4- -> 1-methylcyclohexene + H2SO4\n\nThe final product structure is a six-membered cyclohexene ring with a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, and a methyl group attached to carbon 1."
