    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to first determine the limiting reactant and then calculate the theoretical yield of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene. Finally, we will apply the 75% yield to find the actual amount of product formed.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nC6H5NO2 + 2 Cl2 â†’ C6H3Cl2NO2 + 2 HCl\n\nMolar masses:\n- Nitrobenzene (C6H5NO2): 123.11 g/mol\n- Chlorine gas (Cl2): 70.90 g/mol\n- 2,4-Dichloronitrobenzene (C6H3Cl2NO2): 202.00 g/mol\n\n1. Calculate the moles of reactants:\n- Moles of nitrobenzene: 25 g / 123.11 g/mol = 0.203 mol\n- Moles of chlorine gas: 50 g / 70.90 g/mol = 0.705 mol\n\n2. Determine the limiting reactant:\nThe stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:2, meaning 1 mole of nitrobenzene reacts with 2 moles of chlorine gas. \n\nMoles of Cl2 required for complete reaction with nitrobenzene: 0.203 mol * 2 = 0.406 mol\n\nSince we have 0.705 mol of Cl2, which is more than the required 0.406 mol, nitrobenzene is the limiting reactant.\n\n3. Calculate the theoretical yield of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene:\nFrom the balanced equation, 1 mole of nitrobenzene produces 1 mole of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene.\n\nTheoretical yield: 0.203 mol * 202.00 g/mol = 41.006 g\n\n4. Apply the 75% yield to find the actual amount of product formed:\nActual yield: 41.006 g * 0.75 = 30.7545 g\n\nTherefore, 30.75 grams of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene can be prepared from 25 grams of nitrobenzene and 50 grams of chlorine gas, assuming a 75% yield in the reaction."
