The lattice energy can be calculated using the Born-Haber cycle and the following data:\n\n- The enthalpy of sublimation of magnesium (Mg) is 147 kJ/mol\n- The first ionization energy of magnesium is 738 kJ/mol\n- The enthalpy of formation of MgO is -601 kJ/mol\n- The electron affinity of oxygen is -141 kJ/mol\n- The enthalpy of dissociation of oxygen molecules is 498 kJ/mol.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the lattice energy of magnesium oxide (MgO), we will use the Born-Haber cycle. The Born-Haber cycle is a series of steps that represent the formation of an ionic compound from its constituent elements. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. Sublimation of magnesium (Mg) to form gaseous magnesium atoms (Mg(g))\n2. Ionization of gaseous magnesium atoms (Mg(g)) to form gaseous magnesium ions (Mg²⁺(g))\n3. Dissociation of oxygen molecules (O₂) to form gaseous oxygen atoms (O(g))\n4. Electron affinity of oxygen atoms (O(g)) to form gaseous oxide ions (O²⁻(g))\n5. Formation of magnesium oxide (MgO) from gaseous magnesium ions (Mg²⁺(g)) and gaseous oxide ions (O²⁻(g))\n\nThe lattice energy of MgO is the energy released in step 5. We can calculate this by summing the energies of steps 1-4 and then subtracting the enthalpy of formation of MgO.\n\nStep 1: Enthalpy of sublimation of Mg = 147 kJ/mol\nStep 2: First ionization energy of Mg = 738 kJ/mol\nStep 3: Enthalpy of dissociation of O₂ = 498 kJ/mol (Since we need only 1/2 O₂ molecule for one MgO molecule, we divide this value by 2: 498 kJ/mol ÷ 2 = 249 kJ/mol)\nStep 4: Electron affinity of O = -141 kJ/mol (Since we need 2 electrons for one O²⁻ ion, we multiply this value by 2: -141 kJ/mol × 2 = -282 kJ/mol)\n\nNow, we sum the energies of steps 1-4:\nTotal energy = 147 kJ/mol + 738 kJ/mol + 249 kJ/mol - 282 kJ/mol = 852 kJ/mol\n\nFinally, we subtract the enthalpy of formation of MgO from the total energy to find the lattice energy:\nLattice energy = Total energy - Enthalpy of formation of MgO\nLattice energy = 852 kJ/mol - (-601 kJ/mol) = 852 kJ/mol + 601 kJ/mol = 1453 kJ/mol\n\nThe lattice energy of magnesium oxide (MgO) is 1453 kJ/mol."
