    "message_2": "The reaction between nitrogen gas (N2) and hydrogen gas (H2) to form ammonia gas (NH3) is given by the following balanced chemical equation:\n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) â‡Œ 2NH3(g)\n\nThis reaction is an example of a reversible reaction, meaning it can proceed in both the forward and reverse directions. The position of the equilibrium can be shifted by changing the concentrations of the reactants or products, as described by Le Chatelier's principle.\n\nWhen more ammonia gas is added to the equilibrium mixture, the concentration of NH3 increases. According to Le Chatelier's principle, the system will respond by shifting the equilibrium position to counteract this change. In this case, the equilibrium will shift to the left, favoring the reverse reaction (converting NH3 back to N2 and H2).\n\nAs a result, the concentration of ammonia (NH3) will decrease, while the concentrations of nitrogen (N2) and hydrogen (H2) will increase until a new equilibrium position is established. The overall effect of adding more ammonia gas to the mixture is a shift in the equilibrium position to the left, with increased concentrations of N2 and H2 and a decreased concentration of NH3."
