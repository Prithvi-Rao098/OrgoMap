    "message_2": "The conductivity of inorganic compound solutions generally increases when the concentration of the compound is increased. This is because the conductivity of a solution depends on the concentration of ions present in the solution. Inorganic compounds, when dissolved in water, dissociate into their respective ions. As the concentration of the inorganic compound increases, the number of ions in the solution also increases, leading to a higher conductivity.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the relationship between concentration and conductivity is not always linear. At very high concentrations, the conductivity may not increase proportionally with the concentration due to factors such as ion-ion interactions, viscosity, and the limited mobility of ions in the solution. The relationship between concentration and conductivity can be better understood by studying the specific conductance (also known as molar conductivity) of the solution, which takes into account the concentration of the ions and their individual contributions to the overall conductivity."
