The balanced chemical equation for the combustion of CH4 is:\n\nCH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(l) \n\nWhat is the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) for this reaction?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the combustion of methane, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH° = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants)\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) of O2 is 0 kJ/mol since it is in its elemental form. The standard enthalpy of formation of CO2 is -393.5 kJ/mol.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the equation:\n\nΔH° = [1 × (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 × (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [1 × (-74.8 kJ/mol) + 2 × 0 kJ/mol]\n\nΔH° = (-393.5 - 571.6) - (-74.8)\n\nΔH° = -965.1 + 74.8\n\nΔH° = -890.3 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the combustion of methane is -890.3 kJ/mol."
