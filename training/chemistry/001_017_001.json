    "message_2": "The balanced equation for the oxidation of ethanol (C2H5OH) to acetic acid (CH3COOH) is:\n\nC2H5OH + O2 â†’ CH3COOH + H2O\n\nIn this reaction, the reducing agent is ethanol (C2H5OH) because it loses hydrogen atoms and donates electrons to the oxygen molecule (O2), which is the oxidizing agent."
