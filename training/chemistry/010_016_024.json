    "message_1": "Calculate the polarization in an electrochemical cell consisting of a zinc electrode and a copper electrode. The electrode potentials of zinc and copper are -0.76 V and +0.34 V, respectively. The resistance of the electrolyte solution between the electrodes is 10 ohms, and the current flowing through the cell is 0.5 A.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the polarization in the electrochemical cell, we first need to determine the cell potential (E_cell) and the voltage drop across the electrolyte solution (V_drop).\n\n1. Calculate the cell potential (E_cell):\nE_cell = E_cathode - E_anode\nE_cell = (+0.34 V) - (-0.76 V)\nE_cell = 1.10 V\n\n2. Calculate the voltage drop across the electrolyte solution (V_drop):\nV_drop = I * R\nV_drop = (0.5 A) * (10 ohms)\nV_drop = 5 V\n\n3. Calculate the polarization (P):\nP = E_cell - V_drop\nP = 1.10 V - 5 V\nP = -3.9 V\n\nThe polarization in the electrochemical cell is -3.9 V."
