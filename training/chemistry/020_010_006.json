    "message_2": "When solid NH4Cl is added to the solution, it will dissolve and dissociate into NH4+ and Cl- ions. The reaction can be represented as:\n\nNH4Cl(s) ⇌ NH4+(aq) + Cl-(aq)\n\nSince we are adding more NH4Cl to the solution, the concentration of NH4+ and Cl- ions will increase. According to Le Chatelier's principle, the equilibrium will shift to counteract the change. In this case, the equilibrium will shift to the left, favoring the formation of NH4Cl(s) to reduce the increased concentration of NH4+ and Cl- ions.\n\nNow, let's consider the reaction between NH4+ and NH3:\n\nNH4+(aq) + H2O(l) ⇌ NH3(aq) + H3O+(aq)\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction, known as the Kb, can be calculated using the relationship:\n\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\nWhere Kw is the ion product of water (1.0 x 10^-14 at 25°C), and Ka is the acid dissociation constant of NH4+ (5.6 x 10^-10). \n\nKb = (1.0 x 10^-14) / (5.6 x 10^-10) = 1.79 x 10^-5\n\nLet x be the change in concentration of NH4+ and NH3 due to the addition of solid NH4Cl. At equilibrium, we can write the expression for Kb as:\n\nKb = [(NH3) * (H3O+)] / (NH4+)\n1.79 x 10^-5 = [(0.1 + x) * x] / (0.1 - x)\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx ≈ 4.2 x 10^-6\n\nSo, the final concentration of NH4+ ions will be:\n\n[NH4+] = 0.1 - x ≈ 0.1 - 4.2 x 10^-6 ≈ 0.0999958 M\n\nAnd the final concentration of NH3 ions will be:\n\n[NH3] = 0.1 + x ≈ 0.1 + 4.2 x 10^-6 ≈ 0.1000042 M\n\nIn conclusion, the addition of solid NH4Cl to the solution will cause the equilibrium to shift to the left, slightly decreasing the concentration of NH4+ ions and slightly increasing the concentration of NH3 ions. The final concentrations of NH4+ and NH3 ions in the solution will be approximately 0.0999958 M and 0.1000042 M, respectively."
