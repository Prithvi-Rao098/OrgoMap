    "message_2": "To calculate the surface area of the material, we need to first determine the number of moles of nitrogen adsorbed. The molar mass of nitrogen (N2) is 28.02 g/mol.\n\nNumber of moles of nitrogen (n) = mass / molar mass\nn = 0.100 g / 28.02 g/mol\nn ≈ 0.00357 mol\n\nAccording to the BET theory, the amount of gas adsorbed (n) can be related to the monolayer capacity (n_m) and the pressure (P) as follows:\n\nn = n_m * P / (1 - P)\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for n_m:\n\nn_m = n / (P / (1 - P))\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nn_m = 0.00357 mol / (0.2 / (1 - 0.2))\nn_m ≈ 0.00446 mol\n\nNow that we have the monolayer capacity in moles, we can use the given monolayer capacity in mol/m^2 to find the surface area (A):\n\nA = n_m / (6.8 × 10^-7 mol/m^2)\nA ≈ 0.00446 mol / (6.8 × 10^-7 mol/m^2)\nA ≈ 6,558,823 m^2\n\nSo, the surface area of the material is approximately 6,558,823 m^2."
