    "message_2": "The predicted molecular geometry of the molecule SO2 (sulfur dioxide) using VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) theory is bent or angular. This is because sulfur has 6 valence electrons, and it forms two double bonds with two oxygen atoms, leaving one lone pair of electrons on the sulfur atom. The presence of this lone pair causes a repulsion that results in a bent molecular geometry with a bond angle of approximately 120 degrees."
