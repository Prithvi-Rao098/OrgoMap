    "message_2": "The net yield of ATP molecules produced by one turn of the citric acid cycle is 1 ATP molecule. However, the citric acid cycle also generates other high-energy molecules, such as 3 NADH and 1 FADH2, which play a crucial role in the overall production of ATP in cellular respiration.\n\nThe electron transport chain (ETC) and oxidative phosphorylation are the final stages of cellular respiration, where most of the ATP is produced. The NADH and FADH2 molecules generated in the citric acid cycle, as well as those produced in glycolysis and the pyruvate decarboxylation step, donate their electrons to the ETC. This process creates a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, which drives the synthesis of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation.\n\nIn the ETC, each NADH molecule can generate approximately 2.5 ATP molecules, while each FADH2 molecule can generate approximately 1.5 ATP molecules. Therefore, the 3 NADH and 1 FADH2 produced in one turn of the citric acid cycle can generate approximately 10 ATP molecules (3 NADH x 2.5 ATP/NADH + 1 FADH2 x 1.5 ATP/FADH2).\n\nIn summary, one turn of the citric acid cycle directly produces 1 ATP molecule, but it also generates high-energy molecules that contribute to the production of approximately 10 additional ATP molecules through the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation."
