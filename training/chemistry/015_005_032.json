    "message_2": "To calculate the change in enthalpy (ΔH) for the combustion of methane (CH4) at standard conditions, we need to consider the balanced chemical equation for the combustion reaction:\n\nCH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l)\n\nNext, we need to know the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) for each compound involved in the reaction. The standard enthalpies of formation are as follows:\n\nΔHf° (CH4) = -74.8 kJ/mol\nΔHf° (O2) = 0 kJ/mol (since O2 is in its standard state)\nΔHf° (CO2) = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔHf° (H2O) = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the change in enthalpy (ΔH) for the reaction using the following equation:\n\nΔH = Σ [ΔHf° (products)] - Σ [ΔHf° (reactants)]\n\nΔH = [1 mol × (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 mol × (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [1 mol × (-74.8 kJ/mol) + 2 mol × (0 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH = (-393.5 - 2 × 285.8) - (-74.8)\n\nΔH = -965.1 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the change in enthalpy (ΔH) for the combustion reaction of methane (CH4) at standard conditions (298 K, 1 atm) is -965.1 kJ/mol."
