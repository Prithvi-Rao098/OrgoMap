    "message_2": "To determine the percentage composition of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen in a sample of caffeine, we first need to know the molecular formula of caffeine, which is C8H10N4O2. Next, we'll find the molar mass of each element in the formula and the molar mass of caffeine itself.\n\n1. Calculate the molar mass of each element in the formula:\nCarbon (C): 12.01 g/mol\nHydrogen (H): 1.01 g/mol\nNitrogen (N): 14.01 g/mol\nOxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol\n\n2. Calculate the molar mass of caffeine (C8H10N4O2):\n(8 x 12.01) + (10 x 1.01) + (4 x 14.01) + (2 x 16.00) = 96.08 + 10.10 + 56.04 + 32.00 = 194.22 g/mol\n\n3. Calculate the percentage composition of each element:\nCarbon: (96.08 g/mol / 194.22 g/mol) x 100% = 49.48%\nHydrogen: (10.10 g/mol / 194.22 g/mol) x 100% = 5.20%\nNitrogen: (56.04 g/mol / 194.22 g/mol) x 100% = 28.85%\n\nSo, the percentage composition of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen in a sample of caffeine is approximately 49.48% carbon, 5.20% hydrogen, and 28.85% nitrogen."
