    "message_2": "To calculate the standard free energy change (ΔG°) for the given redox reaction, we can use the Nernst equation:\n\nΔG° = -nFE°\n\nwhere n is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction, F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol), and E° is the standard cell potential.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the number of electrons transferred in the reaction. In this case, the reaction involves the transfer of 6 electrons.\n\nNext, we need to determine the standard cell potential (E°) for the reaction. Since we are given the standard reduction potentials for both half-reactions, we can calculate the overall cell potential by adding them together:\n\nE°(Cr2O7(2-)/Cr(3+)) = 1.33 V\nE°(H2O/O2) = -0.82 V\n\nE°(cell) = E°(Cr2O7(2-)/Cr(3+)) + E°(H2O/O2) = 1.33 V + (-0.82 V) = 0.51 V\n\nNow we can calculate the standard free energy change (ΔG°):\n\nΔG° = -nFE° = -6 mol * 96,485 C/mol * 0.51 V = -295,861.9 J/mol\n\nSince we typically express free energy changes in kJ/mol, we can convert this value:\n\nΔG° = -295,861.9 J/mol * (1 kJ/1000 J) = -295.86 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard free energy change for the given redox reaction at 298 K is -295.86 kJ/mol."
