    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the combustion of methane gas, we need to use the following equation:\n\nΔH = q_p = mcΔT\n\nwhere:\nq_p = heat absorbed or released at constant pressure\nm = mass of the substance (in this case, methane)\nc = specific heat capacity of the substance\nΔT = change in temperature\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of methane (CH4) using its molar mass:\n\nMolar mass of CH4 = 12.01 g/mol (C) + 4 * 1.01 g/mol (H) = 16.05 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the moles of CH4:\n\nmoles of CH4 = mass / molar mass = 5.5 g / 16.05 g/mol = 0.3427 mol\n\nNext, we need to find the heat of combustion of methane (ΔH_combustion). The standard heat of combustion of methane is -890.4 kJ/mol. Since the combustion is exothermic, the heat is released, and the value is negative.\n\nNow, we can find the heat released (q_p) during the combustion of 0.3427 mol of CH4:\n\nq_p = moles of CH4 * ΔH_combustion = 0.3427 mol * -890.4 kJ/mol = -305.1 kJ\n\nNow, we can use the equation ΔH = mcΔT to find the specific heat capacity (c) of methane:\n\nc = ΔH / (m * ΔT) = -305.1 kJ / (5.5 g * 14.6°C) = -3.8 J/g°C\n\nFinally, we can calculate the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the combustion of 5.5 grams of methane gas:\n\nΔH = mcΔT = 5.5 g * -3.8 J/g°C * 14.6°C = -305.1 kJ\n\nSo, the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the combustion of 5.5 grams of methane gas at constant pressure (1 atm) is -305.1 kJ."
