    "message_2": "The Clausius-Clapeyron equation is used to determine the vapor pressure of a substance at different temperatures. However, sodium chloride (NaCl) is a solid at room temperature and does not have a boiling point at 1 atm pressure. Instead, it has a melting point at 1 atm, which is around 801°C (1074 K).\n\nIf you are looking for the boiling point of a solution containing NaCl, such as a saltwater solution, the boiling point elevation can be calculated using the equation:\n\nΔTb = Kb * molality * i\n\nwhere ΔTb is the boiling point elevation, Kb is the ebullioscopic constant for water (0.512°C·kg/mol), molality is the molality of the solution (moles of solute per kilogram of solvent), and i is the van't Hoff factor (number of ions produced per formula unit of solute, which is 2 for NaCl).\n\nHowever, this equation is not applicable for pure NaCl. In the case of pure NaCl, it will undergo sublimation (directly convert from solid to gas) at very high temperatures and low pressures. The sublimation temperature of NaCl is around 1465°C (1738 K) at a pressure of 1 atm."
