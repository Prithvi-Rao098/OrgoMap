    "message_2": "Enantiomers are a pair of stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They have the same molecular formula and the same connectivity of atoms, but they differ in the spatial arrangement of those atoms. This difference in spatial arrangement can lead to different photochemical properties, which are the properties related to the interaction of molecules with light.\n\nThe photochemical properties of enantiomers can differ due to several factors:\n\n1. Chirality and polarization of light: Chiral molecules can interact differently with the two circularly polarized components of light (left and right circularly polarized light). This phenomenon is known as circular dichroism (CD). Enantiomers can absorb these two components of light differently, leading to distinct CD spectra. This difference in absorption can affect the photochemical reactions that the enantiomers undergo when exposed to light.\n\n2. Electronic transitions: The spatial arrangement of atoms in enantiomers can influence their electronic transitions, which are the processes by which electrons move between different energy levels in a molecule. Different electronic transitions can lead to different absorption and emission spectra, affecting the photochemical properties of enantiomers.\n\n3. Steric effects: The three-dimensional structure of enantiomers can cause steric effects, which are the influences of the spatial arrangement of atoms on the reactivity of molecules. Steric effects can impact the accessibility of reactive sites in enantiomers and their interactions with other molecules, leading to differences in their photochemical reactions.\n\n4. Intermolecular interactions: Enantiomers can have different intermolecular interactions with other chiral molecules or chiral environments, such as chiral solvents or chiral catalysts. These interactions can influence the photochemical properties of enantiomers by affecting their stability, solubility, and reactivity.\n\nIn summary, the photochemical properties of enantiomers can differ due to their distinct spatial arrangements, which can influence their interactions with light, electronic transitions, steric effects, and intermolecular interactions. These differences can lead to distinct photochemical reactions and properties for each enantiomer, which can be important in various applications, such as chiral synthesis, enantioselective catalysis, and chiroptical sensing."
