    "message_2": "To determine the minimum amount of chlorine gas required, we first need to find the molecular weights of nitrobenzene and 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene, and then use stoichiometry to calculate the amount of chlorine gas needed.\n\nMolecular weight of nitrobenzene (C6H5NO2):\nC: 6 x 12.01 = 72.06\nH: 5 x 1.01 = 5.05\nN: 1 x 14.01 = 14.01\nO: 2 x 16.00 = 32.00\nTotal: 72.06 + 5.05 + 14.01 + 32.00 = 123.12 g/mol\n\nMolecular weight of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene (C6H3Cl2NO2):\nC: 6 x 12.01 = 72.06\nH: 3 x 1.01 = 3.03\nCl: 2 x 35.45 = 70.90\nN: 1 x 14.01 = 14.01\nO: 2 x 16.00 = 32.00\nTotal: 72.06 + 3.03 + 70.90 + 14.01 + 32.00 = 192.00 g/mol\n\nNow, we can use stoichiometry to find the amount of chlorine gas needed. Since we are assuming 100% yield and excess nitrobenzene, we can set up the following equation:\n\n100 g 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene * (1 mol 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene / 192.00 g 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene) * (123.12 g nitrobenzene / 1 mol nitrobenzene) = x g chlorine gas\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx = 100 g * (1/192.00) * 123.12\nx = 64.04 g\n\nTherefore, the minimum amount of chlorine gas required to prepare 100 grams of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene from nitrobenzene is 64.04 grams."
