    "message_1": "What is the yield of 4-bromoacetanilide produced from the reaction of acetanilide and bromine when starting with a 2g sample of acetanilide and 3.2g of bromine, using sulfuric acid as a catalyst and refluxing the mixture for 2 hours?",
    "message_2": "To determine the yield of 4-bromoacetanilide, we first need to find the limiting reagent in the reaction between acetanilide and bromine. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nC8H9NO + Br2 → C8H8BrNO + HBr\n\nNow, we need to calculate the moles of each reactant:\n\nMolar mass of acetanilide (C8H9NO) = (12.01 * 8) + (1.01 * 9) + 14.01 + 16.00 = 135.17 g/mol\nMoles of acetanilide = mass / molar mass = 2 g / 135.17 g/mol ≈ 0.0148 mol\n\nMolar mass of bromine (Br2) = 2 * 79.90 = 159.80 g/mol\nMoles of bromine = mass / molar mass = 3.2 g / 159.80 g/mol ≈ 0.0200 mol\n\nNow, we need to determine the limiting reagent by comparing the mole ratio:\n\nMole ratio of acetanilide to bromine = 0.0148 mol / 0.0200 mol ≈ 0.74\n\nSince the mole ratio is less than 1, acetanilide is the limiting reagent.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the theoretical yield of 4-bromoacetanilide:\n\nMolar mass of 4-bromoacetanilide (C8H8BrNO) = (12.01 * 8) + (1.01 * 8) + 79.90 + 14.01 + 16.00 = 214.07 g/mol\n\nTheoretical yield = moles of limiting reagent * molar mass of product = 0.0148 mol * 214.07 g/mol ≈ 3.17 g\n\nNow, we need to consider the actual yield, which is typically less than the theoretical yield due to side reactions, incomplete reactions, and other factors. The actual yield can be determined experimentally by isolating and weighing the product. However, without this information, we cannot provide the actual yield of 4-bromoacetanilide in this reaction."
