    "message_2": "To determine the rate law expression, we need to find the order of the reaction with respect to both iodine (I2) and acetone (CH3COCH3). We can do this by comparing the initial rates and concentrations between different experiments.\n\nFirst, let's compare experiments 1 and 2, where the concentration of acetone is constant, but the concentration of iodine is doubled:\n\nRate2 / Rate1 = (4.00 x 10^-3) / (1.00 x 10^-3) = 4\n\n[I2]2 / [I2]1 = (0.20) / (0.10) = 2\n\nSince the rate increases by a factor of 4 when the concentration of iodine is doubled, the reaction is second order with respect to iodine (I2).\n\nNow, let's compare experiments 2 and 3, where the concentration of iodine is constant, but the concentration of acetone is doubled:\n\nRate3 / Rate2 = (8.00 x 10^-3) / (4.00 x 10^-3) = 2\n\n[Acetone]3 / [Acetone]2 = (0.20) / (0.10) = 2\n\nSince the rate increases by a factor of 2 when the concentration of acetone is doubled, the reaction is first order with respect to acetone (CH3COCH3).\n\nNow that we know the reaction is second order with respect to iodine and first order with respect to acetone, we can write the rate law expression:\n\nRate = k [I2]^2 [CH3COCH3]^1\n\nor\n\nRate = k [I2]^2 [Acetone]"
