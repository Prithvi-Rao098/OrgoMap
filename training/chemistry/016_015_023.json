The specific heat capacity of the solution is 4.18 J/g °C and the density of the solution is 1.0 g/mL. The heat of solution of sodium acetate trihydrate is -7126 J/mol.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the moles of sodium acetate trihydrate (NaCH3COO·3H2O) in 10.0 g.\n\nThe molar mass of NaCH3COO·3H2O is:\n(22.99 g/mol for Na) + (12.01 g/mol for C) + (3 × 1.01 g/mol for H) + (2 × 16.00 g/mol for O) + (3 × 18.02 g/mol for 3H2O) = 136.08 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the moles of NaCH3COO·3H2O:\nmoles = mass / molar mass = 10.0 g / 136.08 g/mol = 0.0735 mol\n\nNext, we need to find the heat released when the sodium acetate trihydrate dissolves in water. We can use the heat of solution for this:\n\nq_solution = moles × heat of solution = 0.0735 mol × (-7126 J/mol) = -524.1 J\n\nNow, we need to find the heat absorbed by the solution as it cools from 25°C to 15°C. We can use the specific heat capacity and the mass of the solution for this:\n\nq_cooling = mass × specific heat capacity × ΔT\nmass of the solution = 100.0 mL × 1.0 g/mL = 100.0 g\nΔT = 15°C - 25°C = -10°C\n\nq_cooling = 100.0 g × 4.18 J/g°C × (-10°C) = -4180 J\n\nFinally, we can find the heat of crystallization by adding the heat released during the dissolution and the heat absorbed during cooling:\n\nq_crystallization = q_solution + q_cooling = -524.1 J + (-4180 J) = -4704.1 J\n\nTherefore, the heat of crystallization when 10.0 g of sodium acetate trihydrate is dissolved in 100.0 mL of water and the solution is allowed to cool to 15°C is approximately -4704.1 J."
