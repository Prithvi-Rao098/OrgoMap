    "message_2": "To investigate the toxicity of existing drugs and identify potential adverse effects on human health, we can use a combination of analytical techniques and computational tools in medicinal chemistry. These methods can help predict, detect, and understand the toxic effects of drugs and their metabolites on the human body. Some of the key approaches include:\n\n1. In silico methods: Computational tools, such as molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models, can be used to predict the toxicity of drugs based on their chemical structure and properties. Machine learning algorithms can also be employed to analyze large datasets of drug properties and their toxic effects, identifying patterns and potential adverse effects.\n\n2. In vitro assays: Cell-based assays and biochemical assays can be used to evaluate the toxicity of drugs on specific cell types or biological pathways. High-throughput screening techniques can be employed to test the effects of multiple drugs and their metabolites on various cellular targets, allowing for the rapid identification of potential toxic effects.\n\n3. Analytical techniques: Various analytical methods, such as mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and liquid chromatography, can be used to identify and quantify drug metabolites in biological samples. These techniques can help determine the metabolic pathways of drugs and identify potentially toxic metabolites.\n\n4. Genomic and proteomic approaches: Techniques such as DNA microarrays, RNA sequencing, and proteomics can be used to investigate the effects of drugs on gene expression and protein levels in cells. These approaches can help identify potential biomarkers of drug toxicity and provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying adverse effects.\n\n5. Animal models: In vivo studies using animal models can provide valuable information on the toxicity of drugs in a whole organism context. These studies can help identify potential organ-specific toxicities and assess the safety of drugs before they are tested in humans.\n\n6. Post-marketing surveillance: Monitoring the safety of drugs after they have been approved for use in humans is crucial for identifying potential adverse effects that may not have been detected during preclinical and clinical testing. Pharmacovigilance programs and adverse event reporting systems can help collect and analyze data on drug safety, allowing for the identification of potential toxicities and the implementation of appropriate risk management strategies.\n\nBy combining these various approaches, researchers can gain a comprehensive understanding of the potential toxic effects of drugs and their metabolites, ultimately leading to the development of safer and more effective therapeutics."
