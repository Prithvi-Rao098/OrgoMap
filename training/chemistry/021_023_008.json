    "message_2": "C4H10O has three isomers: two alcohols and one ether. Here are the isomers and the type of isomerism they exhibit:\n\n1. n-Butanol (1-Butanol)\nStructure: CH3-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH\nIsomerism: Chain isomerism\nExplanation: n-Butanol is a straight-chain alcohol with the hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to the terminal carbon atom. Chain isomerism occurs when the carbon skeleton of a molecule is rearranged, resulting in a different structure.\n\n2. 2-Butanol (sec-Butanol)\nStructure: CH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3\nIsomerism: Position isomerism\nExplanation: 2-Butanol is a branched-chain alcohol with the hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to the second carbon atom. Position isomerism occurs when a functional group is attached to a different carbon atom within the same carbon skeleton.\n\n3. Diethyl ether (Ethoxyethane)\nStructure: CH3-CH2-O-CH2-CH3\nIsomerism: Functional group isomerism\nExplanation: Diethyl ether is an ether with an oxygen atom connecting two ethyl groups. Functional group isomerism occurs when a molecule has the same molecular formula but different functional groups, in this case, an ether instead of an alcohol.\n\nIn summary, C4H10O has three isomers: n-butanol, 2-butanol, and diethyl ether. They exhibit chain, position, and functional group isomerism, respectively."
