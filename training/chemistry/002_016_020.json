    "message_2": "To calculate the change in enthalpy (ΔH) and entropy (ΔS) for the reaction, we need to use the standard enthalpies of formation and standard entropies of the substances involved.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n2 H2(g) + O2(g) → 2 H2O(l)\n\nStandard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) at 25°C (298 K):\nH2(g) = 0 kJ/mol (since it's an element in its standard state)\nO2(g) = 0 kJ/mol (since it's an element in its standard state)\nH2O(l) = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nStandard entropies (S°) at 25°C (298 K):\nH2(g) = 130.7 J/mol·K\nO2(g) = 205.2 J/mol·K\nH2O(l) = 69.9 J/mol·K\n\nNow, we can calculate the change in enthalpy (ΔH) and entropy (ΔS) using the following formulas:\n\nΔH = Σ [ΔHf°(products)] - Σ [ΔHf°(reactants)]\nΔS = Σ [S°(products)] - Σ [S°(reactants)]\n\nFor ΔH:\nΔH = [2 × (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [2 × 0 kJ/mol + 1 × 0 kJ/mol]\nΔH = -571.6 kJ/mol\n\nFor ΔS:\nΔS = [2 × 69.9 J/mol·K] - [2 × 130.7 J/mol·K + 1 × 205.2 J/mol·K]\nΔS = 139.8 - 466.6 J/mol·K\nΔS = -326.8 J/mol·K\n\nSo, the change in enthalpy (ΔH) for the reaction is -571.6 kJ/mol, and the change in entropy (ΔS) is -326.8 J/mol·K."
