    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy change for the given reaction, we can use Hess's Law, which states that the enthalpy change for a reaction is the same whether it occurs in one step or several steps. In this case, we can add the two given reactions to obtain the desired reaction, and then add their enthalpy changes to find the enthalpy change for the desired reaction.\n\nFirst, let's write down the given reactions and their enthalpy changes:\n\n1) [Cu(NH3)4]2+ (aq) + 2 H2O (l) → [Cu(H2O)4(OH)2] (s) + 4 NH3 (aq)   ΔH1 = -52.1 kJ/mol\n2) [Cu(H2O)4(OH)2] (s) → [Cu(H2O)6]2+ (aq) + 2 H2O (l)   ΔH2 = 36.6 kJ/mol\n\nNow, let's add the two reactions:\n\n[Cu(NH3)4]2+ (aq) + 2 H2O (l) + [Cu(H2O)4(OH)2] (s) → [Cu(H2O)4(OH)2] (s) + 4 NH3 (aq) + [Cu(H2O)6]2+ (aq) + 2 H2O (l)\n\nNotice that [Cu(H2O)4(OH)2] (s) appears on both sides of the reaction, so we can cancel it out:\n\n[Cu(NH3)4]2+ (aq) + 2 H2O (l) → [Cu(H2O)6]2+ (aq) + 4 NH3 (aq)\n\nNow, we can add the enthalpy changes for the two reactions to find the enthalpy change for the desired reaction:\n\nΔH = ΔH1 + ΔH2 = -52.1 kJ/mol + 36.6 kJ/mol = -15.5 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change for the given reaction is -15.5 kJ/mol."
