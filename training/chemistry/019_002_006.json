    "message_2": "To determine the standard enthalpy of formation of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), we can use the following equation:\n\nΔHf (NO2) = ΔHf (products) - ΔHf (reactants)\n\nFirst, we need to find the enthalpies of formation for the products and reactants in the balanced equation:\n\n4HNO3(aq) + 2NO(g) - 4NO2(g) - 6H2O(l)\n\nThe standard enthalpies of formation for HNO3(l), H2O(l), and NO(g) are given as -174.1 kJ/mol, -285.8 kJ/mol, and 90.4 kJ/mol, respectively. We can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔHf (NO2) = [4(-174.1) + 2(90.4)] - [- 4(NO2) - 6(-285.8)]\n\nNow, we can solve for ΔHf (NO2):\n\nΔHf (NO2) = [-696.4 + 180.8] - [- 4(NO2) + 1714.8]\n\nΔHf (NO2) = [-515.6] - [- 4(NO2) + 1714.8]\n\nNow, we can isolate ΔHf (NO2) on one side of the equation:\n\n4(NO2) = 1714.8 - 515.6\n\n4(NO2) = 1199.2\n\nNow, we can solve for the standard enthalpy of formation of nitrogen dioxide (NO2):\n\nΔHf (NO2) = 1199.2 / 4\n\nΔHf (NO2) = 299.8 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy of formation of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is 299.8 kJ/mol."
