    "message_2": "The photochemical reaction of benzene and chlorine is a substitution reaction, specifically a chlorination reaction. The mechanism involves the following steps:\n\n1. Initiation: Ultraviolet (UV) light causes the homolytic cleavage of the chlorine molecule (Cl2) into two chlorine radicals (Cl•).\n\nCl2 + UV light → 2 Cl•\n\n2. Propagation: The chlorine radical reacts with the benzene molecule, forming a benzene radical and hydrochloric acid (HCl).\n\nBenzene + Cl• → Benzene radical + HCl\n\n3. Termination: The benzene radical reacts with another chlorine radical, forming chlorobenzene.\n\nBenzene radical + Cl• → Chlorobenzene\n\nThe photochemical reaction of benzene and bromine is similar to that of benzene and chlorine, but with some differences in the mechanism:\n\n1. Initiation: UV light causes the homolytic cleavage of the bromine molecule (Br2) into two bromine radicals (Br•).\n\nBr2 + UV light → 2 Br•\n\n2. Propagation: The bromine radical reacts with the benzene molecule, forming a benzene radical and hydrobromic acid (HBr).\n\nBenzene + Br• → Benzene radical + HBr\n\n3. Termination: The benzene radical reacts with another bromine radical, forming bromobenzene.\n\nBenzene radical + Br• → Bromobenzene\n\nThe main difference between the two mechanisms is the type of halogen radical involved (chlorine vs. bromine) and the corresponding halogenated benzene and hydrogen halide products. Additionally, the reaction rate of bromination is generally slower than chlorination due to the lower reactivity of bromine radicals compared to chlorine radicals."
