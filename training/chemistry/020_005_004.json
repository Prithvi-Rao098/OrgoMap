    "message_2": "When a catalyst is added to a reaction mixture that is already in equilibrium, it does not affect the equilibrium position. A catalyst works by lowering the activation energy of a reaction, which increases the rate at which the reaction proceeds. However, it does this for both the forward and reverse reactions, so the net effect on the equilibrium position is zero.\n\nTo understand this, let's consider a simple reversible reaction:\n\nA ⇌ B\n\nThe equilibrium constant, K, for this reaction is given by:\n\nK = [B] / [A]\n\nwhere [A] and [B] represent the concentrations of A and B at equilibrium.\n\nNow, let's say we add a catalyst to this reaction mixture. The catalyst will increase the rate of the forward reaction (A → B) and the reverse reaction (B → A) by the same factor. This means that the reaction will reach equilibrium faster, but the actual equilibrium concentrations of A and B will remain unchanged. Therefore, the equilibrium constant, K, will also remain unchanged.\n\nIn summary, adding a catalyst to a reaction mixture already in equilibrium will not affect the equilibrium position. It will only speed up the rate at which the reaction reaches equilibrium."
