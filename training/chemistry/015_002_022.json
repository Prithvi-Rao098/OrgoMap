    "message_2": "The molecular geometry of methane (CH4) using the VSEPR theory is tetrahedral. In a tetrahedral arrangement, the central carbon atom is surrounded by four hydrogen atoms, with each hydrogen atom occupying a vertex of a regular tetrahedron. The bond angles between the hydrogen-carbon-hydrogen atoms are approximately 109.5 degrees."
