    "message_1": "How would the addition of a catalyst affect the equilibrium position of the redox reaction between iodine and thiosulfate? Calculate the new equilibrium concentrations of products and reactants if 0.5 grams of the catalyst is added to a 100 mL solution containing 0.2 M iodine and 0.1 M thiosulfate at equilibrium.",
    "message_2": "The addition of a catalyst to a reaction does not affect the equilibrium position of the reaction. A catalyst works by lowering the activation energy of the reaction, which increases the rate at which the reaction reaches equilibrium. However, it does not change the equilibrium constant or the concentrations of products and reactants at equilibrium.\n\nIn this case, the redox reaction between iodine (I2) and thiosulfate (S2O3^2-) can be represented as:\n\n2 S2O3^2- (aq) + I2 (aq) â‡Œ S4O6^2- (aq) + 2 I^- (aq)\n\nSince the addition of the catalyst does not change the equilibrium concentrations, the concentrations of the reactants and products at equilibrium will remain the same:\n\n[I2] = 0.2 M\n[S2O3^2-] = 0.1 M\n\nThe equilibrium concentrations of products are not given, but they will also remain the same after the addition of the catalyst. The catalyst will simply help the reaction reach equilibrium faster, but it will not change the equilibrium position or concentrations."
