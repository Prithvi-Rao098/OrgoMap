    "message_2": "To calculate the specific surface area of the activated carbon, we need to determine the total surface area occupied by the adsorbed nitrogen gas and then divide it by the mass of the activated carbon sample.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of nitrogen molecules adsorbed on the activated carbon. At STP (standard temperature and pressure), 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L (22,400 mL). \n\nGiven that the activated carbon adsorbs 20 mL of nitrogen gas, we can calculate the number of moles of nitrogen gas adsorbed:\n\nNumber of moles of N2 = (Volume of N2 adsorbed) / (Volume occupied by 1 mole of gas at STP)\nNumber of moles of N2 = 20 mL / 22,400 mL/mol\nNumber of moles of N2 = 0.000892857 mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of nitrogen molecules using Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23 molecules/mol):\n\nNumber of N2 molecules = Number of moles of N2 × Avogadro's number\nNumber of N2 molecules = 0.000892857 mol × 6.022 x 10^23 molecules/mol\nNumber of N2 molecules ≈ 5.37 x 10^20 molecules\n\nNext, we can calculate the total surface area occupied by the adsorbed nitrogen gas using the given nitrogen cross-sectional area (0.162 nm²):\n\nTotal surface area = Number of N2 molecules × Cross-sectional area of N2\nTotal surface area = 5.37 x 10^20 molecules × 0.162 nm²/molecule\nTotal surface area ≈ 8.70 x 10^20 nm²\n\nTo convert the surface area from nm² to m², we use the conversion factor 1 nm = 10^-9 m:\n\nTotal surface area = 8.70 x 10^20 nm² × (10^-9 m/nm)²\nTotal surface area ≈ 8.70 x 10^2 m²\n\nFinally, we can calculate the specific surface area by dividing the total surface area by the mass of the activated carbon sample (0.5 g):\n\nSpecific surface area = Total surface area / Mass of activated carbon\nSpecific surface area = 8.70 x 10^2 m² / 0.5 g\nSpecific surface area ≈ 1.74 x 10^3 m²/g\n\nSo, the specific surface area of the activated carbon sample is approximately 1,740 m²/g."
