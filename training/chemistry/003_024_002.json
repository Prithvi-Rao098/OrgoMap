    "message_2": "To find the rate constant of the reaction, we can use the integrated rate law for a second-order reaction, since the reaction is second-order with respect to NO and first-order with respect to O2. The overall reaction order is 2 + 1 = 3. However, since we are only given information about the concentration of NO, we will focus on the second-order reaction with respect to NO.\n\nThe integrated rate law for a second-order reaction is:\n\n1/[A]t = kt + 1/[A]0\n\nwhere [A]t is the concentration of NO at time t, [A]0 is the initial concentration of NO, k is the rate constant, and t is the time elapsed.\n\nWe are given the following information:\n\n[A]0 = 1 M (initial concentration of NO)\n[A]t = 0.5 M (concentration of NO after 5 minutes)\nt = 5 minutes = 300 seconds (time elapsed)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the integrated rate law equation:\n\n1/0.5 = k * 300 + 1/1\n\nSolving for k:\n\n2 - 1 = 300k\n1 = 300k\nk = 1/300 s^(-1)\n\nThe rate constant of the reaction at 900°C is 1/300 s^(-1)."
