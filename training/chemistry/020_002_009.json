    "message_1": "A chemical reaction of N2O4(g) ⇌ 2NO2(g) is established in a closed vessel at a certain temperature. The initial concentration of N2O4 is 0.1M. At equilibrium, the concentration of NO2 is found to be 0.6M. Calculate the equilibrium concentration of N2O4.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium concentration of N2O4, we can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table. \n\nInitial concentrations:\n[N2O4] = 0.1 M\n[NO2] = 0 M (since the reaction has not started yet)\n\nChange in concentrations:\nSince the reaction is N2O4 ⇌ 2NO2, for every mole of N2O4 that reacts, 2 moles of NO2 are produced. Let x be the change in concentration of N2O4. Then, the change in concentration of NO2 is 2x.\n\nEquilibrium concentrations:\n[N2O4] = 0.1 - x\n[NO2] = 0 + 2x\n\nAt equilibrium, we are given that the concentration of NO2 is 0.6 M. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n2x = 0.6\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 0.3\n\nNow, we can find the equilibrium concentration of N2O4:\n\n[N2O4] = 0.1 - x\n[N2O4] = 0.1 - 0.3\n[N2O4] = -0.2 M\n\nHowever, a negative concentration is not possible. This indicates that there might be an error in the given information. Please double-check the given values and ensure they are correct."
