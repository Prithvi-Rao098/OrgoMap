    "message_2": "To find the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid, we can use the formula for the ionization constant (Ka) and the definition of pH. \n\nFirst, let's set up an equilibrium expression for the ionization of acetic acid:\n\nCH3COOH (aq) <=> CH3COO- (aq) + H+ (aq)\n\nAt equilibrium, let x be the concentration of CH3COO- and H+ ions. Since the initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.1 M, the equilibrium concentration of acetic acid will be (0.1 - x) M. \n\nNow, we can write the expression for Ka:\n\nKa = [CH3COO-][H+] / [CH3COOH]\n\nGiven that Ka = 1.8 x 10^-5, we can plug in the equilibrium concentrations:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 = (x)(x) / (0.1 - x)\n\nSince Ka is very small, we can assume that x is also very small compared to 0.1, so we can simplify the equation:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 ≈ x^2 / 0.1\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx^2 = 1.8 x 10^-5 * 0.1\nx^2 = 1.8 x 10^-6\nx = √(1.8 x 10^-6)\nx ≈ 1.34 x 10^-3\n\nNow that we have the concentration of H+ ions (x), we can find the pH using the definition of pH:\n\npH = -log[H+]\n\npH = -log(1.34 x 10^-3)\npH ≈ 2.87\n\nSo, the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid is approximately 2.87."
