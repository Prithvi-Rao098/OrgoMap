    "message_2": "In a face-centered cubic (FCC) unit cell, there are 8 corner atoms and 6 face-centered atoms. Each corner atom is shared between 8 neighboring unit cells, and each face-centered atom is shared between 2 adjacent unit cells.\n\nTo calculate the total number of atoms in the FCC unit cell, we can use the following equation:\n\nTotal atoms = (Number of corner atoms × Sharing factor for corner atoms) + (Number of face-centered atoms × Sharing factor for face-centered atoms)\n\nTotal atoms = (8 × 1/8) + (6 × 1/2)\nTotal atoms = 1 + 3\nTotal atoms = 4\n\nSo, there are 4 atoms in a face-centered cubic unit cell.\n\nThe coordination number is the number of nearest neighboring atoms surrounding a central atom in a crystal structure. In an FCC unit cell, each atom has 12 nearest neighbors (6 face-centered atoms and 6 corner atoms). Therefore, the coordination number for a face-centered cubic unit cell is 12."
