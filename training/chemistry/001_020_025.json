    "message_2": "The electrophilic addition reaction between propene (C3H6) and hydrogen bromide (HBr) follows the Markovnikov's rule and proceeds through a two-step mechanism. The product obtained will be 2-bromopropane (C3H7Br).\n\nHere's the step-by-step mechanism:\n\nStep 1: Protonation of the alkene\nThe reaction begins with the nucleophilic attack of the pi electrons of the double bond in propene towards the partially positive hydrogen atom in HBr. This results in the formation of a carbocation intermediate and a bromide ion (Br-). Since the carbocation is more stable when formed on the more substituted carbon, the carbocation will form at the secondary (2°) carbon, leading to a 2° carbocation intermediate.\n\nStep 2: Nucleophilic attack by the bromide ion\nThe bromide ion (Br-) generated in the first step acts as a nucleophile and attacks the positively charged carbon in the carbocation intermediate. This results in the formation of the final product, 2-bromopropane.\n\nOverall, the electrophilic addition of HBr to propene follows Markovnikov's rule, which states that the hydrogen atom will add to the carbon with the greater number of hydrogen atoms already attached, while the halogen (bromine) will add to the carbon with fewer hydrogen atoms. In this case, the hydrogen atom adds to the primary carbon, and the bromine atom adds to the secondary carbon, resulting in the formation of 2-bromopropane."
