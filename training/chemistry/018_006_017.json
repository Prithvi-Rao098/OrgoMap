    "message_2": "The addition of a catalyst to the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide significantly increases the reaction rate. A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without being consumed or altered in the process. It does this by providing an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy, which allows more reactant molecules to have sufficient energy to undergo the reaction.\n\nIn the case of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) decomposition, the reaction can be slow at room temperature. However, when a catalyst is added, such as manganese dioxide (MnO2), potassium iodide (KI), or catalase (an enzyme found in living organisms), the reaction rate increases dramatically.\n\nThe decomposition of hydrogen peroxide can be represented by the following balanced chemical equation:\n\n2 H2O2 â†’ 2 H2O + O2\n\nWhen a catalyst is added, it lowers the activation energy required for the reaction to occur, allowing more hydrogen peroxide molecules to decompose into water and oxygen gas. This results in a faster reaction rate and a more rapid release of oxygen gas, which can be observed as bubbles or foam in the reaction mixture.\n\nIn summary, the addition of a catalyst to the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide significantly increases the reaction rate by providing an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy. This allows the reaction to proceed more quickly and efficiently, producing water and oxygen gas at a faster rate."
