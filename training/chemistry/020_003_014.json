    "message_1": "A chemistry student needs to determine the effect of an increase in temperature on the equilibrium concentration of products and reactants for the reaction N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g). Calculate the new concentration of NH3 at equilibrium when the temperature is raised from 300 K to 400 K.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the Van't Hoff equation, which relates the change in temperature to the change in the equilibrium constant (K). The Van't Hoff equation is:\n\nln(K2/K1) = -ΔH°/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere K1 and K2 are the equilibrium constants at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively, ΔH° is the standard enthalpy change of the reaction, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), and T1 and T2 are the initial and final temperatures in Kelvin.\n\nHowever, we do not have the values for K1, K2, or ΔH°. We need more information to solve this problem. If you can provide the initial equilibrium concentrations or the standard enthalpy change of the reaction, we can proceed with the calculation."
