    "message_2": "To determine the stoichiometric ratio of acetanilide to bromine in the preparation of 4-bromoacetanilide, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nC8H9NO + Br2 â†’ C8H8BrNO + HBr\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of acetanilide (C8H9NO) reacts with 1 mole of bromine (Br2) to produce 1 mole of 4-bromoacetanilide (C8H8BrNO) and 1 mole of hydrogen bromide (HBr). Therefore, the stoichiometric ratio of acetanilide to bromine is 1:1.\n\nChanging the ratio of acetanilide to bromine can affect the yield of the final product in the following ways:\n\n1. If the ratio of acetanilide to bromine is greater than 1:1 (excess acetanilide), the reaction will be limited by the amount of bromine available. This means that not all of the acetanilide will react, and the yield of 4-bromoacetanilide will be lower than expected.\n\n2. If the ratio of acetanilide to bromine is less than 1:1 (excess bromine), the reaction will be limited by the amount of acetanilide available. This means that not all of the bromine will react, and the yield of 4-bromoacetanilide will be lower than expected due to the possibility of over-bromination or side reactions.\n\n3. If the ratio of acetanilide to bromine is exactly 1:1, the reaction will proceed with the highest possible yield, assuming no side reactions or losses during the reaction process.\n\nIn practice, it is common to use a slight excess of one of the reactants to ensure complete reaction of the limiting reagent and maximize the yield of the desired product. However, it is essential to carefully control the reaction conditions to minimize side reactions and over-bromination."
