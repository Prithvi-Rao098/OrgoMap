    "message_2": "To calculate the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid, we can use the formula for the dissociation constant (Ka) and the definition of pH. The dissociation of acetic acid (CH3COOH) in water can be represented as:\n\nCH3COOH ⇌ CH3COO- + H+\n\nThe Ka expression for this reaction is:\n\nKa = [CH3COO-][H+]/[CH3COOH]\n\nLet x be the concentration of H+ ions at equilibrium. Since the reaction is 1:1, the concentration of CH3COO- ions will also be x, and the concentration of CH3COOH will be 0.1 - x. We can now write the Ka expression as:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 = (x)(x)/(0.1 - x)\n\nSince Ka is very small, we can assume that x is much smaller than 0.1, so we can approximate the equation as:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 ≈ x^2/0.1\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx^2 ≈ 1.8 x 10^-5 * 0.1\nx^2 ≈ 1.8 x 10^-6\nx ≈ √(1.8 x 10^-6)\nx ≈ 1.34 x 10^-3\n\nNow that we have the concentration of H+ ions (x), we can calculate the pH using the formula:\n\npH = -log[H+]\npH = -log(1.34 x 10^-3)\npH ≈ 2.87\n\nSo, the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid with a dissociation constant (Ka) of 1.8 x 10^-5 is approximately 2.87."
