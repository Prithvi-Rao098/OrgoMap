    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change of combustion for methane, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH_combustion = Σ ΔHf(products) - Σ ΔHf(reactants)\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\nCH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l)\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation values are:\n\nΔHf(CH4(g)) = -74.81 kJ/mol\nΔHf(CO2(g)) = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔHf(H2O(l)) = -285.83 kJ/mol\n\nWe can now plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔH_combustion = [1 × (-393.5) + 2 × (-285.83)] - [1 × (-74.81) + 2 × 0]\n\nNote that the standard enthalpy of formation for O2(g) is 0 kJ/mol since it is in its standard state.\n\nΔH_combustion = (-393.5 - 571.66) - (-74.81)\n\nΔH_combustion = -965.16 + 74.81\n\nΔH_combustion = -890.35 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change of combustion for methane, CH4(g), is -890.35 kJ/mol."
