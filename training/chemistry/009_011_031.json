    "message_2": "To determine the age of the rock sample, we can use the decay equation:\n\nN(t) = N0 * (1/2)^(t / T)\n\nWhere:\nN(t) = the amount of uranium-238 remaining at time t\nN0 = the initial amount of uranium-238\nt = time elapsed (the age of the rock)\nT = half-life of uranium-238 (4.5 billion years)\n\nSince the ratio of uranium-238 to lead-206 is 0.5, we can say that half of the initial uranium-238 has decayed into lead-206. Therefore, N(t) = 0.5 * N0.\n\n0.5 * N0 = N0 * (1/2)^(t / 4.5)\n\nNow, we can cancel out N0 from both sides of the equation:\n\n0.5 = (1/2)^(t / 4.5)\n\nTo solve for t, we can take the logarithm of both sides:\n\nlog(0.5) = log((1/2)^(t / 4.5))\n\nUsing the logarithm property log(a^b) = b * log(a), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nlog(0.5) = (t / 4.5) * log(1/2)\n\nNow, we can solve for t:\n\nt = (4.5 * log(0.5)) / log(1/2)\n\nt ≈ 4.5 * 1\n\nt ≈ 4.5 billion years\n\nThe approximate age of the rock sample is 4.5 billion years."
