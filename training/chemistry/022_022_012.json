    "message_1": "The problem for the chemistry student to solve related to the subtopic Le Chatelier's principle could be: \n\nA chemical reaction is in equilibrium at a specific temperature and pressure. If the concentration of a reactant is increased, predict the direction in which the reaction will shift and explain whether the equilibrium constant will increase, decrease, or remain the same.",
    "message_2": "When the concentration of a reactant is increased in a chemical reaction at equilibrium, the reaction will shift in the direction that consumes the added reactant, according to Le Chatelier's principle. This principle states that when a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in concentration, temperature, or pressure, the system will adjust itself to counteract the change and restore a new equilibrium.\n\nIn this case, increasing the concentration of a reactant will cause the reaction to shift towards the products side to consume the excess reactant and re-establish equilibrium. This shift will result in an increase in the concentration of the products and a decrease in the concentration of the reactants.\n\nHowever, the equilibrium constant (K) will remain the same, as it is only affected by changes in temperature. The equilibrium constant is a ratio of the concentrations of products to reactants raised to their respective stoichiometric coefficients when the reaction is at equilibrium. Since the reaction is still at the same temperature, the value of K will not change even though the concentrations of reactants and products have changed."
