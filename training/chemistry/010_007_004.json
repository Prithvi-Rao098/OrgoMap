    "message_2": "To calculate the rate of the electrochemical reaction, we first need to determine the number of moles of zinc that react. The molar mass of zinc (Zn) is approximately 65.38 g/mol.\n\n1. Calculate the number of moles of zinc:\nmoles of Zn = (mass of Zn) / (molar mass of Zn)\nmoles of Zn = (2.5 g) / (65.38 g/mol)\nmoles of Zn ≈ 0.038 mol\n\n2. Use Faraday's law to find the number of moles of electrons involved in the reaction:\nFaraday's constant (F) = 96485 C/mol (coulombs per mole of electrons)\n\nThe reaction of zinc in an acidic solution can be represented as:\nZn(s) + 2H+(aq) → Zn2+(aq) + H2(g)\n\nIn this reaction, each mole of zinc releases 2 moles of electrons.\n\n3. Calculate the total charge passed through the circuit:\nCurrent (I) = 0.5 A\nTime (t) = 10 minutes = 600 seconds\nCharge (Q) = I × t\nCharge (Q) = 0.5 A × 600 s = 300 C\n\n4. Calculate the number of moles of electrons passed through the circuit:\nmoles of electrons = Charge (Q) / Faraday's constant (F)\nmoles of electrons = 300 C / 96485 C/mol ≈ 0.00311 mol\n\n5. Calculate the rate of the electrochemical reaction:\nSince 1 mole of Zn releases 2 moles of electrons, the number of moles of Zn reacted is half the number of moles of electrons.\n\nmoles of Zn reacted = 0.00311 mol / 2 ≈ 0.001555 mol\n\nRate of reaction = (moles of Zn reacted) / (time in seconds)\nRate of reaction = 0.001555 mol / 600 s ≈ 2.59 × 10^(-6) mol/s\n\nThe rate of the electrochemical reaction is approximately 2.59 × 10^(-6) mol/s."
