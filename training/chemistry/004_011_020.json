    "message_2": "To determine the molecular structure of the unknown organic compound X using the given ^1H NMR spectral data, we need to analyze the chemical shifts and splitting patterns.\n\n1. Singlet at 2.1 ppm: This chemical shift suggests the presence of a methyl group (CH3) that is not adjacent to any other hydrogen-bearing carbon atoms.\n\n2. Triplet at 2.4 ppm: This splitting pattern indicates the presence of a methylene group (CH2) adjacent to a carbon atom with two hydrogens (CH2). The chemical shift is consistent with an alkyl group.\n\n3. Doublet at 3.6 ppm: This splitting pattern indicates the presence of a methylene group (CH2) adjacent to a carbon atom with one hydrogen (CH). The chemical shift suggests that this CH2 group is next to an electronegative atom, such as an oxygen atom.\n\n4. Quartet at 7.2 ppm: This splitting pattern indicates the presence of a methine group (CH) adjacent to a carbon atom with three hydrogens (CH3). The chemical shift is consistent with an aromatic ring, suggesting that this hydrogen is part of a benzene ring.\n\nBased on this information, we can propose the following molecular structure for compound X:\n\nCH3-CH2-CH2-O-CH2-Ph\n\nwhere \"Ph\" represents the phenyl group (C6H5). The compound is an ethyl propyl ether with a phenyl group attached to the middle carbon."
