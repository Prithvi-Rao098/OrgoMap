    "message_2": "The solubility of sodium chloride (NaCl) in water varies with temperature. Generally, the solubility of most salts increases with an increase in temperature. However, the relationship between solubility and temperature for NaCl is not as significant as it is for other salts. Here is a list of the solubility of NaCl in water at different temperatures:\n\n- 0°C (32°F): 35.7 g NaCl/100 g water\n- 20°C (68°F): 35.9 g NaCl/100 g water\n- 40°C (104°F): 37.2 g NaCl/100 g water\n- 60°C (140°F): 38.9 g NaCl/100 g water\n- 80°C (176°F): 40.8 g NaCl/100 g water\n- 100°C (212°F): 39.1 g NaCl/100 g water\n\nAs the temperature increases from 0°C to 100°C, the solubility of NaCl in water increases from 35.7 g to 40.8 g per 100 g of water. However, it's important to note that the solubility of NaCl slightly decreases at 100°C, which is an exception to the general trend.\n\nIn summary, the solubility of sodium chloride in water does increase with temperature, but the change is relatively small compared to other salts."
