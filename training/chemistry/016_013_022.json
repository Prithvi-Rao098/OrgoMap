    "message_2": "To calculate the heat of hydration of magnesium sulfate, we first need to determine the heat absorbed by the solution. We can do this using the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat absorbed, m is the mass of the solution, c is the specific heat of water, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nFirst, let's find the mass of the solution. Since the density of the solution is 1.03 g/mL, and the volume of the solution is 25.0 mL, we can calculate the mass as follows:\n\nmass = density × volume\nmass = 1.03 g/mL × 25.0 mL\nmass = 25.75 g\n\nNow, we can calculate the change in temperature (ΔT):\n\nΔT = T_final - T_initial\nΔT = 36.5°C - 25°C\nΔT = 11.5°C\n\nNow we can calculate the heat absorbed by the solution (q):\n\nq = mcΔT\nq = (25.75 g)(4.18 J/(g•°C))(11.5°C)\nq = 1246.8 J\n\nNow, to find the heat of hydration per mole of magnesium sulfate, we need to divide the heat absorbed by the moles of MgSO₄. First, let's find the molar mass of MgSO₄:\n\nMgSO₄ = 24.31 g/mol (Mg) + 32.07 g/mol (S) + 4(16.00 g/mol) (O)\nMgSO₄ = 120.38 g/mol\n\nNow, let's find the moles of MgSO₄:\n\nmoles = mass / molar mass\nmoles = 5.00 g / 120.38 g/mol\nmoles = 0.0415 mol\n\nFinally, we can calculate the heat of hydration of magnesium sulfate:\n\nHeat of hydration = q / moles\nHeat of hydration = 1246.8 J / 0.0415 mol\nHeat of hydration = 30024 J/mol\n\nTherefore, the heat of hydration of magnesium sulfate is approximately 30,024 J/mol."
