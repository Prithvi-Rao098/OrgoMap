    "message_2": "To determine the reaction order, we need to analyze the relationship between the initial concentration of NOBr and the rate of the reaction. The rate of the reaction can be represented by the rate of formation of either NO or Br2. Let's use the formation of NO as an example.\n\nThe general rate law for this reaction can be written as:\n\nRate = k[NOBr]^x\n\nwhere k is the rate constant, [NOBr] is the concentration of NOBr, and x is the reaction order.\n\nNow, let's analyze the data from the table:\n\n1. When [NOBr] = 0.0100 M, Rate = 4.50×10^−5 mol/L\n2. When [NOBr] = 0.0200 M, Rate = 9.00×10^−5 mol/L\n3. When [NOBr] = 0.0300 M, Rate = 1.35×10^−4 mol/L\n\nWe can see that when the concentration of NOBr doubles (from 0.0100 M to 0.0200 M), the rate of the reaction also doubles. Similarly, when the concentration of NOBr triples (from 0.0100 M to 0.0300 M), the rate of the reaction also triples. This indicates that the reaction is first-order with respect to NOBr.\n\nNow, let's find the overall reaction rate constant (k) using the first data point:\n\nRate = k[NOBr]^x\n4.50×10^−5 mol/L = k(0.0100 M)^1\n\nSolving for k, we get:\n\nk = 4.50×10^−3 L/mol·s\n\nSo, the overall reaction order is 1, and the reaction rate constant is 4.50×10^−3 L/mol·s."
