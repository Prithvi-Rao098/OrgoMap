    "message_2": "To calculate the age of the sample, we can use the radioactive decay formula:\n\nN(t) = N0 * (1/2)^(t/T)\n\nwhere:\nN(t) = number of radioactive atoms at time t\nN0 = initial number of radioactive atoms\nt = time elapsed (in years)\nT = half-life of the radioactive substance (in years)\n\nIn this case, we are given the decay rate (disintegrations per second) instead of the number of radioactive atoms. However, we can still use the same formula by replacing N(t) and N0 with their respective decay rates:\n\nR(t) = R0 * (1/2)^(t/T)\n\nwhere:\nR(t) = decay rate at time t (0.0125 disintegrations per second)\nR0 = initial decay rate (100 disintegrations per second)\nt = time elapsed (in years)\nT = half-life of Carbon-14 (5730 years)\n\nNow we can plug in the given values and solve for t:\n\n0.0125 = 100 * (1/2)^(t/5730)\n\nTo solve for t, we can first divide both sides by 100:\n\n0.0125 / 100 = (1/2)^(t/5730)\n\n0.000125 = (1/2)^(t/5730)\n\nNow, we can take the logarithm of both sides to the base of 1/2:\n\nlog(1/2) (0.000125) = log(1/2) ((1/2)^(t/5730))\n\nt/5730 = log(1/2) (0.000125) / log(1/2)\n\nt/5730 = log(2) (0.000125) / log(2)\n\nt/5730 = log(0.000125) / log(0.5)\n\nt = 5730 * (log(0.000125) / log(0.5))\n\nt ≈ 5730 * (-3.6439 / -0.3010)\n\nt ≈ 5730 * 12.107\n\nt ≈ 69377.1 years\n\nThe age of the sample is approximately 69,377 years."
