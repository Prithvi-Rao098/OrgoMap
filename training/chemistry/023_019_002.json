    "message_2": "To synthesize polyacrylonitrile (PAN) from acrylonitrile monomer with a high yield and molecular weight, the following conditions are typically used:\n\n1. Temperature: The polymerization of acrylonitrile is usually carried out at a temperature between 30째C and 80째C. Lower temperatures can result in slower reaction rates, while higher temperatures can cause premature termination of the polymer chains, leading to lower molecular weights. A temperature of around 50-60째C is often used to achieve a balance between reaction rate and molecular weight.\n\n2. Reaction time: The reaction time for synthesizing PAN can vary depending on the specific process and desired properties of the final product. Generally, the reaction is allowed to proceed for several hours to ensure a high conversion of monomer to polymer. In some cases, the reaction may be allowed to continue for up to 24 hours or more to achieve the desired molecular weight and yield.\n\n3. Catalyst: The polymerization of acrylonitrile is typically initiated using a redox catalyst system, which consists of an initiator and a reducing agent. Common initiators include ammonium persulfate (APS) or potassium persulfate (KPS), while reducing agents can include sodium bisulfite (NaHSO3) or sodium metabisulfite (Na2S2O5). The choice of catalyst and its concentration can significantly impact the reaction rate, molecular weight, and yield of the resulting PAN.\n\nIn summary, to synthesize PAN with a high yield and molecular weight, a temperature of around 50-60째C, a reaction time of several hours (or more, depending on the desired properties), and a redox catalyst system consisting of an initiator and a reducing agent should be used. The specific conditions and concentrations of the catalyst system should be optimized based on the desired properties of the final product."
