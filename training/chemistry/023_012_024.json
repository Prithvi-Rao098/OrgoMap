    "message_2": "To calculate the maximum yield of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) from the given amounts of toluene and nitric acid, we need to first determine the limiting reactant. The balanced chemical equation for the synthesis of TNT is:\n\nC7H8 (toluene) + 3 HNO3 (nitric acid) → C7H5N3O6 (TNT) + 3 H2O (water)\n\nNext, we need to find the moles of each reactant:\n\nMolar mass of toluene (C7H8) = 7(12.01) + 8(1.01) = 92.14 g/mol\nMolar mass of nitric acid (HNO3) = 1.01 + 14.01 + 3(16.00) = 63.02 g/mol\n\nMoles of toluene = 1000 g / 92.14 g/mol = 10.85 moles\nMoles of nitric acid = 2000 g / 63.02 g/mol = 31.73 moles\n\nNow, we need to find the mole ratio of toluene to nitric acid in the balanced equation:\n\nMole ratio = moles of toluene / moles of nitric acid = 10.85 / 31.73 = 0.342\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction requires 1 mole of toluene for every 3 moles of nitric acid (1:3 ratio), the limiting reactant is toluene because the mole ratio is less than 1/3.\n\nNow, we can calculate the maximum yield of TNT:\n\nMolar mass of TNT (C7H5N3O6) = 7(12.01) + 5(1.01) + 3(14.01) + 6(16.00) = 227.13 g/mol\n\nMaximum yield of TNT = moles of toluene × molar mass of TNT = 10.85 moles × 227.13 g/mol = 2464.76 g\n\nHowever, this value exceeds the total mass of reactants (1 kg toluene + 2 kg nitric acid = 3 kg or 3000 g). Therefore, the maximum yield of TNT cannot be greater than the total mass of reactants. So, the maximum yield of TNT is 3000 g.\n\nNow, we can calculate the percentage yield of TNT:\n\nPercentage yield = (actual yield / maximum yield) × 100\nPercentage yield = (850 g / 3000 g) × 100 = 28.33%\n\nThe percentage yield of TNT obtained is 28.33%."
