    "message_1": "What is the mass of copper deposited on the cathode when a current of 2.5A is passed through a solution of copper sulfate for 3 hours? The molar mass of copper is 63.5 g/mol, and the Faraday constant is 96,485 C/mol.",
    "message_2": "To find the mass of copper deposited on the cathode, we can use Faraday's laws of electrolysis. The first law states that the mass of a substance deposited on an electrode during electrolysis is directly proportional to the amount of charge passed through the electrolyte.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total charge passed through the electrolyte. The charge (Q) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nQ = I × t\n\nwhere I is the current (in amperes) and t is the time (in seconds).\n\nGiven that the current is 2.5 A and the time is 3 hours, we can convert the time to seconds:\n\n3 hours × (3600 seconds/hour) = 10,800 seconds\n\nNow, we can calculate the total charge:\n\nQ = 2.5 A × 10,800 s = 27,000 C\n\nNext, we need to find the number of moles of electrons (n) passed through the electrolyte. We can use the Faraday constant (F) for this calculation:\n\nn = Q / F\n\nwhere F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol).\n\nn = 27,000 C / 96,485 C/mol ≈ 0.2798 mol\n\nSince the copper ions in the copper sulfate solution have a charge of +2 (Cu²⁺), it takes two moles of electrons to deposit one mole of copper:\n\nmoles of Cu = 0.2798 mol electrons / 2 = 0.1399 mol Cu\n\nFinally, we can find the mass of copper deposited on the cathode by multiplying the moles of copper by the molar mass of copper:\n\nmass of Cu = moles of Cu × molar mass of Cu\n\nmass of Cu = 0.1399 mol × 63.5 g/mol ≈ 8.89 g\n\nTherefore, the mass of copper deposited on the cathode is approximately 8.89 grams."
