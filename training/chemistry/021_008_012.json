    "message_2": "Ozone (O₃) is a molecule consisting of three oxygen atoms. It has two resonance structures that contribute to its stability. These resonance structures can be represented as follows:\n\n1. O=O-O (a double bond between the first and second oxygen atoms, and a single bond between the second and third oxygen atoms)\n2. O-O=O (a single bond between the first and second oxygen atoms, and a double bond between the second and third oxygen atoms)\n\nIn both resonance structures, there is a formal charge of +1 on the central oxygen atom and a formal charge of -1 on the terminal oxygen atom with a single bond. The other terminal oxygen atom with a double bond has no formal charge.\n\nThese resonance structures contribute to the stability of the ozone molecule by delocalizing the electrons in the molecule. The actual structure of ozone is a hybrid of these two resonance structures, where the electrons are shared between all three oxygen atoms. This delocalization of electrons results in a bond order of 1.5 for each oxygen-oxygen bond, meaning that the bonds are intermediate between a single bond and a double bond.\n\nThe resonance stabilization in ozone is important because it lowers the overall energy of the molecule, making it more stable than if it only had one possible structure. This stability is crucial for ozone's role in the Earth's atmosphere, where it helps to absorb harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun."
