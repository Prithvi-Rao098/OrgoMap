    "message_1": "What is the purity percentage of a sample of unknown substance if its melting point is 110°C and the literature value for the melting point of the pure substance is 120°C? Use the data collected from the student's melting point determination experiment and relevant purity tables for similar substances to calculate the level of impurity in the sample.",
    "message_2": "To determine the purity percentage of the unknown substance, we can use the melting point depression method. This method is based on the fact that the presence of impurities in a substance lowers its melting point. However, without specific data on the depression constant for the substance or a purity table for similar substances, we cannot provide an exact purity percentage.\n\nIn general, the formula for calculating the molality of the impurity (m) is:\n\nΔT = Kf * m\n\nwhere ΔT is the difference in melting points (literature value - observed value), and Kf is the cryoscopic constant for the substance.\n\nHowever, without the cryoscopic constant (Kf) or a purity table for similar substances, we cannot calculate the exact molality of the impurity or the purity percentage.\n\nIn this case, we can only provide a rough estimate based on the difference in melting points:\n\nΔT = 120°C - 110°C = 10°C\n\nSince the melting point of the unknown substance is 10°C lower than the literature value, it indicates that there are impurities present in the sample. The larger the difference in melting points, the higher the level of impurities. However, without further information, we cannot provide an exact purity percentage."
