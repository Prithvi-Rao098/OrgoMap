    "message_2": "Ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) consists of two ions: the ammonium ion (NH4+) and the nitrate ion (NO3-). To determine the oxidation state of nitrogen in NH4NO3, we need to find the oxidation state of nitrogen in each ion separately.\n\n1. In the ammonium ion (NH4+):\nHydrogen has an oxidation state of +1. Since there are four hydrogen atoms, the total positive charge from hydrogen is +4. To balance the overall charge of the ion, the oxidation state of nitrogen (N) in NH4+ must be -3.\n\n2. In the nitrate ion (NO3-):\nOxygen has an oxidation state of -2. Since there are three oxygen atoms, the total negative charge from oxygen is -6. To balance the overall charge of the ion, the oxidation state of nitrogen (N) in NO3- must be +5.\n\nSo, in NH4NO3, nitrogen has two different oxidation states: -3 in the ammonium ion (NH4+) and +5 in the nitrate ion (NO3-)."
