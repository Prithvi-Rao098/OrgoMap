    "message_2": "Isomerism is a phenomenon in which two or more compounds have the same molecular formula but different structural arrangements of atoms. To determine the isomerism of a molecule, a student can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the molecular formula of the compound.\n2. Determine the different ways in which the atoms can be arranged to form distinct structures.\n3. Analyze the types of isomerism present in the compound.\n\nThere are two main types of isomerism: structural isomerism and stereoisomerism.\n\nStructural isomerism (also known as constitutional isomerism) occurs when the atoms in a molecule are connected in different ways. There are several subtypes of structural isomerism:\n\na. Chain isomerism: Atoms are connected in different linear arrangements. For example, pentane (C5H12) has three chain isomers: n-pentane, isopentane, and neopentane.\n\nb. Position isomerism: The position of a functional group or substituent differs between isomers. For example, propanol (C3H8O) has two position isomers: 1-propanol and 2-propanol.\n\nc. Functional group isomerism: Different functional groups are present in the isomers. For example, C2H6O can represent either ethanol (an alcohol) or dimethyl ether (an ether).\n\nd. Ring isomerism: The arrangement of atoms in a cyclic structure differs between isomers. For example, 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane and 1,4-dichlorocyclohexane are ring isomers.\n\nStereoisomerism occurs when the atoms in a molecule have the same connectivity but different spatial arrangements. There are two subtypes of stereoisomerism:\n\na. Geometric isomerism (cis-trans or E-Z isomerism): This occurs in compounds with restricted rotation around a double bond or a ring structure. For example, in 2-butene (C4H8), there are two geometric isomers: cis-2-butene and trans-2-butene.\n\nb. Optical isomerism (enantiomerism): This occurs in compounds with a chiral center, which is an atom (usually carbon) bonded to four different groups. Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. For example, in 2-chlorobutane (C4H9Cl), there are two optical isomers: (R)-2-chlorobutane and (S)-2-chlorobutane.\n\nBy understanding these types of isomerism and analyzing the molecular formula and structure of a compound, a student can determine the isomerism of a molecule and identify its various isomers."
