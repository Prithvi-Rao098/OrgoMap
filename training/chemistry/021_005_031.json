    "message_2": "In a molecule of carbon dioxide (CO2), there are two carbon-oxygen double bonds. To determine the polarity of these bonds, we need to consider the electronegativity difference between carbon and oxygen.\n\nElectronegativity is a measure of the tendency of an atom to attract a bonding pair of electrons. Oxygen is more electronegative than carbon, with electronegativity values of 3.44 and 2.55, respectively. The electronegativity difference between carbon and oxygen is 3.44 - 2.55 = 0.89.\n\nTypically, if the electronegativity difference between two atoms is greater than 0.5, the bond is considered polar. Therefore, the bond between carbon and oxygen in CO2 is polar.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while the individual carbon-oxygen bonds are polar, the overall CO2 molecule is nonpolar. This is because CO2 has a linear molecular geometry, with the two oxygen atoms symmetrically arranged around the central carbon atom. The polarities of the two carbon-oxygen bonds cancel each other out, resulting in a nonpolar molecule."
