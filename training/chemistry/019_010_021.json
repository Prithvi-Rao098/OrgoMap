    "message_1": "What is the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of methane gas (CH4) at standard conditions (25°C and 1 atm pressure)? Given that the balanced equation for the reaction is:\n\nCH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(l)\n\nThe standard enthalpies of formation are: \n\nΔHf°(CH4) = -74.8 kJ/mol,\nΔHf°(CO2) = -393.5 kJ/mol,\nΔHf°(H2O) = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nExpress your answer in kJ/mol of CH4.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of methane gas (CH4), we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH°(reaction) = Σ [ΔHf°(products)] - Σ [ΔHf°(reactants)]\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\nCH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(l)\n\nThe standard enthalpies of formation are:\n\nΔHf°(CH4) = -74.8 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(CO2) = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(H2O) = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nWe can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔH°(reaction) = [1 × (-393.5) + 2 × (-285.8)] - [1 × (-74.8) + 2 × 0]\n\nNote that the standard enthalpy of formation for O2 is 0 kJ/mol, as it is an element in its standard state.\n\nΔH°(reaction) = (-393.5 - 571.6) - (-74.8)\nΔH°(reaction) = -965.1 + 74.8\nΔH°(reaction) = -890.3 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of methane gas (CH4) at standard conditions (25°C and 1 atm pressure) is -890.3 kJ/mol of CH4."
