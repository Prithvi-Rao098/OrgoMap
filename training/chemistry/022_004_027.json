    "message_2": "To determine the oxidation state of copper (Cu) in CuSO₄, we need to understand the rules for assigning oxidation states to elements in a compound. Here are the rules:\n\n1. The oxidation state of an element in its free state (uncombined with other elements) is 0. For example, Cu(s), O₂(g), and S₈(s) all have oxidation states of 0.\n\n2. The oxidation state of a monatomic ion is equal to its charge. For example, Na⁺ has an oxidation state of +1, and Cl⁻ has an oxidation state of -1.\n\n3. The sum of the oxidation states of all atoms in a neutral compound is 0. For example, in H₂O, the oxidation states of H and O are +1 and -2, respectively, and the sum is 0.\n\n4. The sum of the oxidation states of all atoms in a polyatomic ion is equal to the charge of the ion. For example, in SO₄²⁻, the sum of the oxidation states is -2.\n\n5. The oxidation state of oxygen is usually -2, except in peroxides (where it is -1) and in compounds with fluorine (where it can be positive).\n\n6. The oxidation state of hydrogen is usually +1 when bonded to nonmetals and -1 when bonded to metals.\n\nNow, let's apply these rules to CuSO₄:\n\nCuSO₄ is a neutral compound, so the sum of the oxidation states of all atoms must be 0.\n\nIn SO₄²⁻, the sulfate ion, the sum of the oxidation states is -2. Since there are four oxygen atoms, each with an oxidation state of -2, the total oxidation state for oxygen is -8. According to rule 5, the oxidation state of sulfur (S) must be +6 to make the sum of the oxidation states in SO₄²⁻ equal to -2.\n\nNow, we can determine the oxidation state of copper (Cu) in CuSO₄. The sum of the oxidation states in CuSO₄ is 0, so:\n\nCu + S + 4(O) = 0\nCu + (+6) + 4(-2) = 0\nCu - 2 = 0\n\nSolving for Cu, we get:\n\nCu = +2\n\nTherefore, the oxidation state of copper in CuSO₄ is +2."
