    "message_2": "The critical micelle concentration (CMC) of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in water varies with temperature and pH. SDS is an anionic surfactant, and its CMC is influenced by factors such as temperature, ionic strength, and pH of the solution.\n\nAt room temperature (25°C), the CMC of SDS in water is approximately 8.2 mM (millimolar). As the temperature increases, the CMC generally decreases. For example, at 40°C, the CMC of SDS is around 6.5 mM, and at 60°C, it is about 4.6 mM.\n\nRegarding the pH of the solution, the CMC of SDS is not significantly affected by pH changes in the range of pH 5 to 9. However, at extremely acidic or alkaline conditions, the CMC may be affected due to the ionization state of the surfactant. In highly acidic conditions (pH < 2), the CMC of SDS can increase because the sulfate headgroup of SDS can become protonated, reducing its solubility in water. In highly alkaline conditions (pH > 12), the CMC may also be affected due to the presence of counterions that can interact with the surfactant.\n\nIt is important to note that the CMC values mentioned above are approximate and can vary depending on the specific experimental conditions and the purity of the SDS used."
