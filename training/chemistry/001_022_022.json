    "message_2": "The rearrangement reaction that occurs when 2-bromopentane is treated with sodium ethoxide in ethanol is the E2 elimination reaction, which leads to the formation of an alkene. The mechanism of this reaction is as follows:\n\n1. Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) acts as a strong base in this reaction. The ethoxide ion (EtO-) abstracts a proton (H+) from the β-carbon (carbon adjacent to the carbon attached to the bromine atom) of 2-bromopentane. \n\n2. Simultaneously, the electrons from the C-H bond that was broken form a double bond between the α-carbon (carbon attached to the bromine atom) and the β-carbon.\n\n3. At the same time, the C-Br bond breaks, and the bromide ion (Br-) leaves as a leaving group.\n\n4. The final product is an alkene. In this case, there are two possible products: 2-pentene (the major product) and 3-pentene (the minor product). The major product is formed according to Zaitsev's rule, which states that the more substituted alkene is the major product in an elimination reaction.\n\nOverall, the E2 elimination reaction occurs in a single concerted step, with the base abstracting a proton, the formation of the double bond, and the departure of the leaving group happening simultaneously."
