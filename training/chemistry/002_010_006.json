    "message_2": "To find the density of sodium chloride, we can use the formula:\n\nDensity = mass/volume\n\nGiven:\nMass of NaCl = 29.2 g\nVolume of NaCl = 25 mL\n\nNow, we can calculate the density:\n\nDensity = (29.2 g) / (25 mL) = 1.168 g/mL\n\nSo, the density of sodium chloride in the given sample is 1.168 g/mL."
