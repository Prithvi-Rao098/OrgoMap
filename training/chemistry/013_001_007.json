    "message_2": "The strength of adsorption of gases on solid surfaces varies with temperature due to the balance between the kinetic energy of gas molecules and the attractive forces between the gas molecules and the solid surface. This relationship can be described by the adsorption isotherm models, such as the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms, and the adsorption isosteric heat.\n\nAs the temperature increases, the kinetic energy of gas molecules also increases, which can lead to a decrease in the adsorption strength as the gas molecules are more likely to overcome the attractive forces between them and the solid surface. Conversely, at lower temperatures, the kinetic energy of gas molecules is lower, and the attractive forces between the gas molecules and the solid surface dominate, leading to stronger adsorption.\n\nExperimental evidence supporting this relationship can be obtained through adsorption isotherm studies, where the amount of gas adsorbed on a solid surface is measured at different temperatures and pressures. One such study is the adsorption of nitrogen on activated carbon, which has been widely investigated in the literature.\n\nIn a study by Yang and Lua (2003), the adsorption of nitrogen on activated carbon was investigated at various temperatures (77, 87, and 98 K) and pressures. The results showed that the adsorption capacity of nitrogen on activated carbon decreased with increasing temperature, indicating that the strength of adsorption was weaker at higher temperatures. This observation is consistent with the general trend of gas adsorption on solid surfaces.\n\nAnother study by Alcaniz-Monge et al. (2007) investigated the adsorption of methane on activated carbon at temperatures ranging from 273 to 343 K. The results showed that the adsorption capacity decreased with increasing temperature, further supporting the inverse relationship between adsorption strength and temperature.\n\nThese experimental results, along with numerous other studies, provide evidence that the strength of adsorption of gases on solid surfaces generally decreases with increasing temperature due to the balance between the kinetic energy of gas molecules and the attractive forces between the gas molecules and the solid surface.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.
