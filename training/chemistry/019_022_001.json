    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy change for the given reaction using Hess's Law, we need to manipulate the given reactions and their enthalpy changes to match the target reaction.\n\nThe target reaction is:\nC2H5OH(l) + 3O2(g) -> 2CO2(g) + 3H2O(l)\n\nGiven reactions are:\n1. C2H5OH(l) --> 2 CO2(g) + 3 H2O(l) ∆H = -1411 kJ/mol\n2. 2 H2(g) + O2(g) --> 2 H2O(l) ∆H = -572 kJ/mol\n\nWe can see that the first given reaction is already in the correct form for the target reaction. Now, we need to manipulate the second given reaction to cancel out the H2(g) and O2(g) terms.\n\nTo do this, we can reverse the second reaction and multiply it by 3/2 to match the number of moles of O2(g) in the target reaction:\n\n-3/2 (2 H2(g) + O2(g) --> 2 H2O(l)) ∆H = 3/2 * 572 kJ/mol\n\nThis gives us the new reaction:\n3 H2O(l) -> 3 H2(g) + 3/2 O2(g) ∆H = 858 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can add the two manipulated reactions together:\n\nC2H5OH(l) --> 2 CO2(g) + 3 H2O(l) ∆H = -1411 kJ/mol\n3 H2O(l) -> 3 H2(g) + 3/2 O2(g) ∆H = 858 kJ/mol\n----------------------------------------------\nC2H5OH(l) + 3O2(g) -> 2CO2(g) + 3H2O(l) ∆H = -553 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change for the target reaction is -553 kJ/mol."
