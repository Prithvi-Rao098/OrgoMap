    "message_2": "In PF5 (Phosphorus Pentafluoride) molecule, the central atom is Phosphorus (P). To determine the hybridization of the central atom, we need to consider the number of electron domains around it.\n\nPhosphorus has 5 valence electrons, and it forms 5 sigma bonds with 5 Fluorine atoms. So, there are 5 electron domains around the central Phosphorus atom.\n\nAccording to the VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) theory, the hybridization of an atom is determined by the number of electron domains around it. In this case, there are 5 electron domains, which corresponds to sp³d hybridization.\n\nSo, the hybridization of the central Phosphorus atom in PF5 is sp³d."
