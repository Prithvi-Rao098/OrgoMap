The cylinder absorbs 120 joules of heat during the heating process. Calculate the heat capacity of the metal cylinder. (Assume a specific heat capacity of 0.385 J/g°C.)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the heat capacity of the metal cylinder, we can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat absorbed (in joules), m is the mass (in grams), c is the specific heat capacity (in J/g°C), and ΔT is the change in temperature (in °C).\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- mass (m) = 50 grams\n- initial temperature (T_initial) = 25°C\n- final temperature (T_final) = 75°C\n- heat absorbed (q) = 120 joules\n- specific heat capacity (c) = 0.385 J/g°C\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the change in temperature (ΔT):\nΔT = T_final - T_initial\nΔT = 75°C - 25°C\nΔT = 50°C\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n120 J = (50 g)(0.385 J/g°C)(50°C)\n\nTo solve for the heat capacity (c), we can rearrange the formula:\nc = q / (mΔT)\n\nc = 120 J / (50 g * 50°C)\nc = 120 J / 2500 g°C\nc = 0.048 J/g°C\n\nThe heat capacity of the metal cylinder is 0.048 J/g°C."
