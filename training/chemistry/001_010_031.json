    "message_2": "When ethanal (CH3CHO) undergoes a nucleophilic addition reaction with aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a hydroxide ion (OH-) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of ethanal. This results in the formation of an alkoxide intermediate, which then picks up a proton (H+) from the surrounding water molecules to form the final product, which is a hydrate of ethanal, also known as a geminal diol.\n\nThe product formed is ethane-1,1-diol (CH3CH(OH)2)."
