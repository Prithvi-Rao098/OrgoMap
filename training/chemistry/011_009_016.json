    "message_2": "To calculate the energy difference between the ground state (n1 = 1) and the first excited state (n2 = 2) of the hydrogen atom, we can use the Rydberg formula for energy levels:\n\nE = -13.6 eV * (1/n^2)\n\nwhere E is the energy of the electron in the hydrogen atom, n is the principal quantum number, and 13.6 eV is the ionization energy of hydrogen.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the energy of the ground state (n1 = 1):\n\nE1 = -13.6 eV * (1/1^2) = -13.6 eV\n\nNow, let's calculate the energy of the first excited state (n2 = 2):\n\nE2 = -13.6 eV * (1/2^2) = -13.6 eV * (1/4) = -3.4 eV\n\nFinally, let's find the energy difference between the ground state and the first excited state:\n\nÎ”E = E2 - E1 = -3.4 eV - (-13.6 eV) = 10.2 eV\n\nSo, the energy difference between the ground state and the first excited state of the hydrogen atom is 10.2 electron volts (eV)."
