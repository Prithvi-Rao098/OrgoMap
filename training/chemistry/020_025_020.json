    "message_1": "What is the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the following reaction at 25°C when the concentration of reactants and products is:\n\n2Fe²⁺(aq) + H₂O₂(aq) + 2H⁺(aq) ⇌ 2Fe³⁺(aq) + 2H₂O(l)\n\n[Fe²⁺] = 0.045 M, [H₂O₂] = 0.015 M, [H⁺] = 0.06 M, [Fe³⁺] = 0.08 M",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction, we need to use the expression for Kc and plug in the given concentrations of the reactants and products. Since the reaction involves aqueous species and liquid water, we do not include the concentration of liquid water in the Kc expression.\n\nThe Kc expression for the given reaction is:\n\nKc = [Fe³⁺]^2 / ([Fe²⁺]^2 * [H₂O₂] * [H⁺]^2)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given concentrations:\n\nKc = (0.08)^2 / ((0.045)^2 * 0.015 * (0.06)^2)\n\nKc = 0.0064 / (0.002025 * 0.015 * 0.0036)\n\nKc ≈ 0.0064 / 0.00010935\n\nKc ≈ 58.5\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction at 25°C is approximately 58.5."
