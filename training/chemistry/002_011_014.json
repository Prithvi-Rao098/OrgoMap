    "message_2": "Using the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory, we can determine the molecular geometry and polarity of a carbon dioxide (CO2) molecule.\n\nFirst, let's determine the Lewis structure of CO2. Carbon has 4 valence electrons, and each oxygen atom has 6 valence electrons. The total number of valence electrons in the CO2 molecule is 16 (4 from carbon and 6 from each oxygen atom). The Lewis structure of CO2 is:\n\nO=C=O\n\nNow, let's determine the molecular geometry using the VSEPR theory. Carbon is the central atom, and it is bonded to two oxygen atoms with double bonds. There are no lone pairs on the central carbon atom. According to the VSEPR theory, the electron groups around the central atom will arrange themselves to minimize repulsion. In this case, there are two electron groups (double bonds) around the central carbon atom, which will arrange themselves linearly. Therefore, the molecular geometry of CO2 is linear.\n\nFinally, let's determine the polarity of the CO2 molecule. Polarity depends on the electronegativity difference between the atoms and the molecular geometry. Oxygen is more electronegative than carbon, so the electrons in the C=O bonds are attracted more towards the oxygen atoms. However, due to the linear geometry of the CO2 molecule, the two C=O bonds are opposite to each other, and their dipole moments cancel each other out. As a result, the CO2 molecule is nonpolar.\n\nIn summary, the molecular geometry of a carbon dioxide (CO2) molecule is linear, and its polarity is nonpolar."
