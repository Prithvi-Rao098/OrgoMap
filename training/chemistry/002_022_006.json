    "message_1": "What is the lattice energy of CaO? Given that the ionic radii of Ca2+ and O2- are 0.99 Å and 1.40 Å respectively, and the enthalpy of sublimation of Ca is 178 kJ/mol, and the electron affinity of O is -141 kJ/mol. (Hint: use Coulomb's law and the Born-Lande equation to calculate the lattice energy)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the lattice energy of CaO, we can use the Born-Lande equation:\n\nU = -N_A * (M * z^2 * e^2) / (4 * π * ε_0 * r_0) * (1 - (1 / n))\n\nwhere:\nU is the lattice energy\nN_A is Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23 mol^-1)\nM is the Madelung constant (for CaO, M = 1.748)\nz is the charge of the ions (for Ca2+ and O2-, z = 2)\ne is the elementary charge (1.602 x 10^-19 C)\nε_0 is the vacuum permittivity (8.854 x 10^-12 C^2 J^-1 m^-1)\nr_0 is the distance between the ions (sum of ionic radii)\nn is the Born exponent (for CaO, n = 9)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate r_0, the distance between the ions:\n\nr_0 = 0.99 Å + 1.40 Å = 2.39 Å = 2.39 x 10^-10 m\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Born-Lande equation:\n\nU = - (6.022 x 10^23 mol^-1) * (1.748 * (2^2) * (1.602 x 10^-19 C)^2) / (4 * π * (8.854 x 10^-12 C^2 J^-1 m^-1) * (2.39 x 10^-10 m)) * (1 - (1 / 9))\n\nU = - (6.022 x 10^23 mol^-1) * (1.748 * 16 * (1.602 x 10^-19 C)^2) / (4 * π * (8.854 x 10^-12 C^2 J^-1 m^-1) * (2.39 x 10^-10 m)) * (1 - (1 / 9))\n\nU ≈ - 3.52 x 10^6 J/mol\n\nThe lattice energy of CaO is approximately -3.52 x 10^6 J/mol."
