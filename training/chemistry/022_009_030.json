    "message_2": "In a double replacement reaction, the cations and anions of the two compounds switch places to form new compounds. In this case, sodium chloride (NaCl) and silver nitrate (AgNO3) will undergo a double replacement reaction.\n\nThe reaction can be represented as:\n\nNaCl (aq) + AgNO3 (aq) â†’ NaNO3 (aq) + AgCl (s)\n\nThe products of the reaction are sodium nitrate (NaNO3) and silver chloride (AgCl). Silver chloride will precipitate out of the solution as a solid because it is poorly soluble in water."
