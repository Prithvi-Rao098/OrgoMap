    "message_1": "What will be the effect on the equilibrium position of the reaction N2 (g) + 3H2 (g) ⇌ 2NH3 (g) if we add more H2 (g) into the reaction vessel? Justify your answer with a complete explanation.",
    "message_2": "When more H2 (g) is added into the reaction vessel, the concentration of H2 (g) will increase. According to Le Chatelier's principle, the system will try to counteract this change and restore equilibrium by shifting the position of the equilibrium to the side that will consume the added H2 (g).\n\nIn this case, the equilibrium will shift to the right, towards the formation of NH3 (g). This is because the forward reaction consumes H2 (g) and N2 (g) to produce NH3 (g). As the reaction proceeds in the forward direction, the concentration of H2 (g) will decrease, while the concentration of NH3 (g) will increase.\n\nThe shift in the equilibrium position will continue until a new equilibrium is established, with a higher concentration of NH3 (g) and a lower concentration of H2 (g) and N2 (g) compared to the initial equilibrium state.\n\nIn summary, adding more H2 (g) into the reaction vessel will cause the equilibrium position of the reaction N2 (g) + 3H2 (g) ⇌ 2NH3 (g) to shift to the right, resulting in an increased concentration of NH3 (g) and decreased concentrations of H2 (g) and N2 (g) at the new equilibrium. This is in accordance with Le Chatelier's principle, which states that a system at equilibrium will adjust to counteract any changes in the concentrations of the reactants or products."
