    "message_2": "To determine the equilibrium concentrations of the reactants and products, we can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table. \n\nInitial concentrations:\n[H2] = 0.2 M\n[O2] = 0.1 M\n[H2O] = 0 M\n\nChange in concentrations:\nLet x be the change in concentration of H2 and O2. Since the stoichiometry of the reaction is 2:1:2, the change in concentration of H2O will be 2x.\n\nEquilibrium concentrations:\n[H2] = 0.2 - 2x\n[O2] = 0.1 - x\n[H2O] = 2x\n\nNow, we can write the expression for the equilibrium constant (Kc):\n\nKc = [H2O]^2 / ([H2]^2 * [O2])\n\nPlug in the equilibrium concentrations and the given Kc value:\n\n4.67 x 10^3 = (2x)^2 / ((0.2 - 2x)^2 * (0.1 - x))\n\nNow, we need to solve for x. Since this is a quadratic equation, it might be difficult to solve it algebraically. Instead, we can use a numerical method or a calculator to find the value of x.\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that x ≈ 0.0485.\n\nNow, we can find the equilibrium concentrations:\n\n[H2] = 0.2 - 2x ≈ 0.2 - 2(0.0485) ≈ 0.103 M\n[O2] = 0.1 - x ≈ 0.1 - 0.0485 ≈ 0.0515 M\n[H2O] = 2x ≈ 2(0.0485) ≈ 0.097 M\n\nSo, the equilibrium concentrations are approximately [H2] = 0.103 M, [O2] = 0.0515 M, and [H2O] = 0.097 M."
