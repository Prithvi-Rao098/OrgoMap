    "message_2": "The coordination number of a transition metal ion in a complex compound refers to the number of ligands (atoms, ions, or molecules) that are directly bonded to the central metal ion. It indicates the number of donor atoms surrounding the central metal ion in a complex.\n\nAn example of a complex with a coordination number of 6 is hexaaquairon(III) ion, [Fe(H2O)6]3+. In this complex, the central metal ion is iron (Fe3+), and it is surrounded by six water molecules (H2O) acting as ligands.\n\nThe octahedral geometry that results from a coordination number of 6 can be visualized as an octahedron, a polyhedron with eight faces, twelve edges, and six vertices. In this geometry, the central metal ion is at the center of the octahedron, and the six ligands are located at the vertices. The ligands are arranged in such a way that they are equidistant from the central metal ion, and the angles between any two adjacent ligands are 90 degrees. This arrangement minimizes the repulsion between the electron pairs of the ligands, resulting in a stable complex."
