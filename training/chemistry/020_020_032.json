The equilibrium constant $\\mathrm{K_c}$ for the reaction is 2.2 x $10^{12}$.",
    "message_2": "To find the concentration of $\\mathrm{[Cu(NH_3)_4]^{2+}}$ at equilibrium when the temperature is increased by 10°C, we first need to determine the new equilibrium constant at the higher temperature. We can use the Van't Hoff equation to do this:\n\n$\\frac{d \\ln K_c}{dT} = \\frac{\\Delta H^\\circ}{RT^2}$\n\nHowever, we do not have the enthalpy change ($\\Delta H^\\circ$) for the reaction. Instead, we can make an assumption that the equilibrium constant does not change significantly with a 10°C increase in temperature. This is a reasonable assumption for many reactions, but it may not be accurate for all cases.\n\nUsing the given equilibrium constant, $\\mathrm{K_c = 2.2 \\times 10^{12}}$, we can set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) to find the equilibrium concentrations of all species:\n\n```\n               Cu²⁺(aq) + 4NH₃(aq) ⇌ [Cu(NH₃)₄]²⁺(aq)\nInitial (M):     0.10       0.20             0\nChange (M):     -x         -4x              +x\nEquilibrium (M): 0.10-x     0.20-4x          x\n```\n\nNow, we can write the expression for the equilibrium constant:\n\n$\\mathrm{K_c = \\frac{[Cu(NH_3)_4]^{2+}}{[Cu^{2+}][NH_3]^4}}$\n\nPlugging in the equilibrium concentrations:\n\n$\\mathrm{2.2 \\times 10^{12} = \\frac{x}{(0.10-x)(0.20-4x)^4}}$\n\nSolving this equation for x can be quite challenging due to the high power of 4. However, since the equilibrium constant is very large, we can assume that x is small compared to 0.10 and 0.20. This allows us to simplify the equation:\n\n$\\mathrm{2.2 \\times 10^{12} = \\frac{x}{(0.10)(0.20)^4}}$\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n$x = \\mathrm{2.2 \\times 10^{12} \\times (0.10)(0.20)^4}$\n\n$x \\approx 0.0996$\n\nThus, the concentration of $\\mathrm{[Cu(NH_3)_4]^{2+}}$ at equilibrium when the temperature is increased by 10°C is approximately 0.0996 M. Keep in mind that this result is based on the assumption that the equilibrium constant does not change significantly with the 10°C increase in temperature."
