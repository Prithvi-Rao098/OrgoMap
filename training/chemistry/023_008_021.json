    "message_1": "What is the yield of p-nitroaniline obtained when 10 grams of aniline is reacted with a 10 mL of 70% nitric acid solution for 1 hour?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the yield of p-nitroaniline, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the limiting reactant.\n2. Calculate the theoretical yield.\n3. Apply the reaction conditions to estimate the actual yield.\n\nFirst, let's write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nC6H7N + HNO3 â†’ C6H6N2O2 + H2O\n\nAniline (C6H7N) reacts with nitric acid (HNO3) to form p-nitroaniline (C6H6N2O2) and water (H2O).\n\nStep 1: Determine the limiting reactant\n\nMolar mass of aniline (C6H7N) = (6 x 12.01) + (7 x 1.01) + 14.01 = 93.13 g/mol\nMoles of aniline = mass / molar mass = 10 g / 93.13 g/mol = 0.107 mol\n\nMolar mass of nitric acid (HNO3) = 1.01 + 14.01 + (3 x 16.00) = 63.02 g/mol\nSince we have a 70% nitric acid solution, the mass of nitric acid in 10 mL is:\nMass of nitric acid = 10 mL x 1.42 g/mL (density of 70% HNO3) x 0.7 = 9.94 g\nMoles of nitric acid = mass / molar mass = 9.94 g / 63.02 g/mol = 0.158 mol\n\nThe stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, so we need an equal amount of moles of both reactants. Since we have fewer moles of aniline (0.107 mol) than nitric acid (0.158 mol), aniline is the limiting reactant.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the theoretical yield\n\nMolar mass of p-nitroaniline (C6H6N2O2) = (6 x 12.01) + (6 x 1.01) + (2 x 14.01) + (2 x 16.00) = 138.12 g/mol\nTheoretical yield of p-nitroaniline = moles of limiting reactant x molar mass of product = 0.107 mol x 138.12 g/mol = 14.78 g\n\nStep 3: Apply the reaction conditions to estimate the actual yield\n\nThe actual yield depends on the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and time. Since we are given only the reaction time (1 hour), we cannot accurately estimate the actual yield without more information about the reaction conditions and the efficiency of the reaction.\n\nHowever, if we assume that the reaction goes to completion (100% yield) under the given conditions, the actual yield of p-nitroaniline would be equal to the theoretical yield, which is 14.78 g."
