    "message_2": "To calculate the theoretical yield of acetylsalicylic acid, we first need to determine the limiting reactant in the reaction. The balanced chemical equation for the synthesis of acetylsalicylic acid is:\n\nC7H6O3 (salicylic acid) + C4H6O3 (acetic anhydride) → C9H8O4 (acetylsalicylic acid) + C2H4O2 (acetic acid)\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of each reactant:\n\nMolar mass of salicylic acid (C7H6O3) = (7 × 12.01) + (6 × 1.01) + (3 × 16.00) = 138.12 g/mol\nMoles of salicylic acid = 5 g / 138.12 g/mol = 0.0362 mol\n\nThe density of acetic anhydride is approximately 1.08 g/mL, so 10 mL of acetic anhydride weighs 10 mL × 1.08 g/mL = 10.8 g.\n\nMolar mass of acetic anhydride (C4H6O3) = (4 × 12.01) + (6 × 1.01) + (3 × 16.00) = 102.09 g/mol\nMoles of acetic anhydride = 10.8 g / 102.09 g/mol = 0.1058 mol\n\nNow, we can determine the limiting reactant by comparing the mole ratio of the reactants:\n\nMole ratio of salicylic acid to acetic anhydride = 0.0362 mol / 0.1058 mol = 0.342\n\nSince the mole ratio is less than 1, salicylic acid is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow, we can calculate the theoretical yield of acetylsalicylic acid:\n\nMoles of acetylsalicylic acid = moles of salicylic acid = 0.0362 mol\nMolar mass of acetylsalicylic acid (C9H8O4) = (9 × 12.01) + (8 × 1.01) + (4 × 16.00) = 180.16 g/mol\nTheoretical yield of acetylsalicylic acid = 0.0362 mol × 180.16 g/mol = 6.52 g\n\nSo, the theoretical yield of acetylsalicylic acid is 6.52 grams, assuming complete reaction and 100% yield."
