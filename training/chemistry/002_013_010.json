    "message_2": "To determine the hybridization of the central atom in a molecule of SF6 (sulfur hexafluoride), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the central atom: In SF6, sulfur (S) is the central atom.\n\n2. Calculate the total number of valence electrons: Sulfur has 6 valence electrons, and each fluorine atom has 7 valence electrons. Since there are 6 fluorine atoms, the total number of valence electrons is 6 (for S) + 6 * 7 (for 6 F atoms) = 6 + 42 = 48 valence electrons.\n\n3. Determine the electron pair geometry: In SF6, sulfur forms 6 single bonds with 6 fluorine atoms, using all 48 valence electrons. This results in an octahedral electron pair geometry around the central sulfur atom.\n\n4. Identify the hybridization: For an octahedral electron pair geometry, the central atom's hybridization is sp3d2. This means that the sulfur atom uses one s, three p, and two d orbitals to form six hybrid orbitals, which then form six sigma bonds with the six fluorine atoms.\n\nSo, the hybridization of the central atom (sulfur) in SF6 is sp3d2."
