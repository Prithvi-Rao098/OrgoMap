    "message_1": "What is the equilibrium constant (K) for the following reaction at 25°C if the initial concentration of hydrogen gas (H2) is 0.200 M, the initial concentration of iodine gas (I2) is 0.100 M, and the initial concentration of hydrogen iodide gas (HI) is 0.500 M?\n\nH2(g) + I2(g) ⇌ 2HI(g)",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (K) for the given reaction, we first need to set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations of each species. \n\n```\n          H2(g)   +   I2(g)   ⇌   2HI(g)\nInitial:  0.200 M     0.100 M         0.500 M\nChange:   -x          -x          +2x\nEquilibrium: 0.200-x   0.100-x     0.500+2x\n```\n\nNow, we can write the expression for the equilibrium constant K:\n\nK = [HI]^2 / ([H2] * [I2])\n\nSince we don't have the value of K, we cannot directly solve for x. However, we can assume that the reaction has reached equilibrium and use the given initial concentrations to find the equilibrium concentrations:\n\nLet's assume x is small compared to the initial concentrations, so we can approximate the equilibrium concentrations as:\n\n[H2] ≈ 0.200 M\n[I2] ≈ 0.100 M\n[HI] ≈ 0.500 M\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the K expression:\n\nK ≈ (0.500)^2 / (0.200 * 0.100) = 0.25 / 0.02 = 12.5\n\nThe equilibrium constant (K) for the given reaction at 25°C is approximately 12.5. Keep in mind that this is an approximation, and the actual value of K may be slightly different."
