    "message_2": "To determine the number of electrons transferred in the electrochemical reaction, we first need to identify the half-reactions occurring at each electrode.\n\nFor the copper electrode, the half-reaction is:\nCu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Cu(s)    E°(Cu²⁺/Cu) = +0.34 V\n\nFor the tin electrode, the half-reaction is:\nSn²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Sn(s)    E°(Sn²⁺/Sn) = -0.14 V\n\nIn a galvanic cell, the anode is where oxidation occurs, and the cathode is where reduction occurs. Since the copper half-reaction has a more positive standard reduction potential, it will act as the cathode (reduction). The tin half-reaction will act as the anode (oxidation). The overall cell reaction is obtained by adding the two half-reactions:\n\nCu²⁺(aq) + Sn(s) → Cu(s) + Sn²⁺(aq)\n\nNow, we can calculate the cell potential (E°cell) using the standard reduction potentials:\n\nE°cell = E°(cathode) - E°(anode)\nE°cell = E°(Cu²⁺/Cu) - E°(Sn²⁺/Sn)\nE°cell = (+0.34 V) - (-0.14 V)\nE°cell = 0.48 V\n\nHowever, the observed cell potential is 0.63 V, which is higher than the calculated standard cell potential. This discrepancy could be due to non-standard conditions, such as different concentrations or temperatures. Nevertheless, the number of electrons transferred in the reaction remains the same.\n\nIn the balanced overall cell reaction:\n\nCu²⁺(aq) + Sn(s) → Cu(s) + Sn²⁺(aq)\n\nWe can see that 2 electrons are transferred from the tin electrode (anode) to the copper electrode (cathode). Therefore, the number of electrons transferred in the electrochemical reaction is 2."
