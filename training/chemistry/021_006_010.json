    "message_2": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a linear molecule with a carbon atom in the center and two oxygen atoms on either side. The carbon-oxygen bonds in CO2 are polar due to the difference in electronegativity between carbon and oxygen atoms. However, because of the linear geometry of the molecule, the dipole moments of the two carbon-oxygen bonds are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. As a result, they cancel each other out.\n\nTherefore, the net dipole moment of the CO2 molecule is 0 Debye."
