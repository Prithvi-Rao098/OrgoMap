The reaction takes place in 100 mL of water and produces 2 moles of NH3 and 1 mole of NaCl in solution. Assume that the specific heat capacity of water is 4.18 J/g·K and that the final solution temperature after the reaction is complete is 25°C.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the entropy change (∆S) for the reaction, we need to consider the entropy change of the system (∆S_system) and the entropy change of the surroundings (∆S_surroundings). Since the final temperature of the solution remains constant at 25°C, the entropy change of the surroundings will be zero. Therefore, we only need to calculate the entropy change of the system.\n\nThe reaction is as follows:\n2 NH4Cl (s) + NaOH (s) → 2 NH3 (aq) + NaCl (aq) + H2O (l)\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard molar entropies (S°) for each substance involved in the reaction. The standard molar entropies can be found in a standard thermodynamic table. The values are as follows:\n\nS° (NH4Cl, s) = 94.6 J/mol·K\nS° (NaOH, s) = 64.5 J/mol·K\nS° (NH3, aq) = 80.8 J/mol·K\nS° (NaCl, aq) = 115.5 J/mol·K\nS° (H2O, l) = 69.9 J/mol·K\n\nNow we can calculate the entropy change of the system (∆S_system) using the following equation:\n\n∆S_system = Σ S°(products) - Σ S°(reactants)\n\n∆S_system = [2 × S°(NH3, aq) + S°(NaCl, aq) + S°(H2O, l)] - [2 × S°(NH4Cl, s) + S°(NaOH, s)]\n\n∆S_system = [2 × 80.8 + 115.5 + 69.9] - [2 × 94.6 + 64.5]\n\n∆S_system = [277.1] - [253.7]\n\n∆S_system = 23.4 J/K\n\nSince the entropy change of the surroundings is zero, the total entropy change (∆S) for the reaction is equal to the entropy change of the system:\n\n∆S = ∆S_system = 23.4 J/K"
