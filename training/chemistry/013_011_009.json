    "message_2": "The critical micelle concentration (CMC) of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in water varies with temperature. To determine the CMC values at different temperatures, you can use surface tension measurements. Here's a general outline of the procedure:\n\n1. Prepare a series of SDS solutions with varying concentrations in water. Make sure to cover a range of concentrations below and above the expected CMC.\n\n2. Measure the surface tension of each solution at the desired temperature using a tensiometer or a Wilhelmy plate method.\n\n3. Plot the surface tension as a function of SDS concentration for each temperature. The graph should show a decrease in surface tension with increasing SDS concentration.\n\n4. Identify the breakpoint in the graph, which represents the CMC. The breakpoint is where the slope of the curve changes significantly, indicating the formation of micelles. At concentrations below the CMC, the surface tension decreases linearly with increasing concentration. Above the CMC, the surface tension remains relatively constant as the SDS molecules form micelles.\n\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for different temperatures to observe how the CMC varies with temperature.\n\nIn general, the CMC of SDS in water decreases with increasing temperature. This is because the hydrophobic effect, which drives micelle formation, becomes stronger at higher temperatures. As a result, SDS molecules are more likely to aggregate into micelles at elevated temperatures.\n\nFor example, the CMC of SDS in water at 25°C is approximately 8.2 mM, while at 40°C, it is around 6.2 mM. Keep in mind that these values are approximate and may vary depending on the specific experimental conditions and the purity of the SDS used."
