    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the formula:\n\nΔH_reaction = Σ ΔH_products - Σ ΔH_reactants\n\nwhere ΔH_reaction is the standard enthalpy change of the reaction, ΔH_products are the enthalpy values of the products, and ΔH_reactants are the enthalpy values of the reactants.\n\nFor this reaction, the reactants are NaOH(aq) and HCl(aq), and the products are NaCl(aq) and H2O(l). Using the given enthalpy values, we can calculate the standard enthalpy change as follows:\n\nΔH_reaction = [(-411.2 kJ/mol) + (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [(-469.2 kJ/mol) + (-167.2 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH_reaction = (-696.0 kJ/mol) - (-636.4 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH_reaction = -59.6 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the reaction is -59.6 kJ/mol."
