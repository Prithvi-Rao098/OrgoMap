    "message_2": "The solubility of silver chloride (AgCl) in water decreases when the concentration of sodium chloride (NaCl) is increased in the solution. This is due to the common ion effect, where the presence of a common ion (in this case, Cl-) in the solution reduces the solubility of a sparingly soluble salt (AgCl).\n\nTo calculate the new solubility of AgCl, we can use the solubility product constant (Ksp) and the concentrations of the ions in the solution.\n\nThe Ksp of AgCl is 1.77 x 10^-10. The balanced dissolution reaction for AgCl is:\n\nAgCl (s) ⇌ Ag+ (aq) + Cl- (aq)\n\nInitially, the solution contains 0.01 M AgCl and no NaCl. When 0.1 M NaCl is added, the Cl- concentration increases by 0.1 M. The new equilibrium concentrations will be:\n\n[Ag+] = x\n[Cl-] = 0.1 + x\n\nSince Ksp = [Ag+][Cl-], we can set up the equation:\n\n1.77 x 10^-10 = x(0.1 + x)\n\nAssuming x is much smaller than 0.1 (which is reasonable given the low solubility of AgCl), we can approximate the equation as:\n\n1.77 x 10^-10 ≈ x(0.1)\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nx ≈ 1.77 x 10^-10 / 0.1\nx ≈ 1.77 x 10^-9\n\nThe new solubility of AgCl in the presence of 0.1 M NaCl is approximately 1.77 x 10^-9 M."
