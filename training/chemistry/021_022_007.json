    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which relates the pH, pKa, and the concentrations of an acid and its conjugate base:\n\npH = pKa + log10([A-]/[HA])\n\nIn this case, acetic acid (CH3COOH) is the weak acid (HA) and sodium acetate (CH3COONa) is the source of the conjugate base, acetate ion (CH3COO-, A-). The pKa of acetic acid is given as 4.76.\n\nFirst, we need to find the concentrations of the acid and its conjugate base:\n\n[HA] = 0.1 M (concentration of acetic acid)\n[A-] = 0.05 M (concentration of sodium acetate)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = 4.76 + log10(0.05/0.1)\n\npH = 4.76 + log10(0.5)\n\npH = 4.76 - 0.301 (rounded to three decimal places)\n\npH â‰ˆ 4.46\n\nSo, the pH of the solution containing 0.1 M acetic acid and 0.05 M sodium acetate is approximately 4.46."
