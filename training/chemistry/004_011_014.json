    "message_2": "To identify the compound with the molecular formula C10H12O using its proton NMR spectrum, we would need the actual NMR spectrum data, including chemical shifts, splitting patterns, and integration values. However, I can still provide some general guidance on how to interpret a proton NMR spectrum to identify a compound.\n\n1. First, analyze the chemical shifts of the peaks in the spectrum. Chemical shifts are measured in parts per million (ppm) and can help you identify the types of protons in the molecule. Here are some general guidelines for chemical shift ranges:\n\n   - Aliphatic protons (CH3, CH2, CH): 0-3 ppm\n   - Alkenes (C=C-H): 4.5-6.5 ppm\n   - Aromatic protons (C6H5): 6.5-8.5 ppm\n   - Aldehydes (CHO): 9-10 ppm\n   - Carboxylic acids (COOH): 10-12 ppm\n\n2. Next, examine the splitting patterns of the peaks. Splitting patterns can help you determine the number of neighboring protons for a given proton. The n+1 rule states that the number of peaks in a splitting pattern is equal to the number of neighboring protons plus one. For example, a doublet indicates one neighboring proton, a triplet indicates two neighboring protons, and so on.\n\n3. Finally, look at the integration values for each peak. Integration values represent the relative number of protons that correspond to a specific peak. This information can help you determine the number of protons in each environment.\n\nOnce you have gathered all this information from the proton NMR spectrum, you can piece together the structure of the compound. Start by identifying the functional groups and the types of protons present in the molecule based on chemical shifts. Then, use the splitting patterns and integration values to determine the connectivity of the atoms and the overall structure of the compound.\n\nIf you provide the actual NMR spectrum data, I can help you interpret it and identify the compound with the molecular formula C10H12O."
