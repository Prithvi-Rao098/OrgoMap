    "message_2": "To find the activation energy (Ea) for the reaction, we can use the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk = A * e^(-Ea / RT)\n\nwhere k is the rate constant, A is the frequency factor, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol K), T is the temperature in Kelvin, and e is the base of the natural logarithm.\n\nFirst, we need to rearrange the equation to solve for Ea:\n\nEa = -RT * ln(k / A)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nEa = - (8.314 J/mol K) * (300 K) * ln((4.81 x 10^8 M^-1 s^-1) / (1.22 x 10^14 s^-1))\n\nEa = - (2494.2 J/mol) * ln(3.94 x 10^-6)\n\nEa ≈ - (2494.2 J/mol) * (-12.743)\n\nEa ≈ 31779.9 J/mol\n\nThe activation energy for the reaction between hydrogen gas and oxygen gas to form water at 300 K is approximately 31,780 J/mol."
