    "message_2": "To find the molar mass of copper (II) sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO4·5H2O), we need to add the molar masses of each element in the compound.\n\nCopper (Cu): 63.55 g/mol\nSulfur (S): 32.07 g/mol\nOxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol (There are 9 oxygen atoms in the compound: 4 in the sulfate ion and 5 in the water molecules)\nHydrogen (H): 1.01 g/mol (There are 10 hydrogen atoms in the compound, all in the water molecules)\n\nNow, we can calculate the molar mass of the compound:\n\nCuSO4: 63.55 (Cu) + 32.07 (S) + 4 * 16.00 (O) = 159.62 g/mol\n5H2O: 5 * (2 * 1.01 (H) + 16.00 (O)) = 5 * 18.02 = 90.10 g/mol\n\nAdding the molar masses of CuSO4 and 5H2O:\n\nCuSO4·5H2O: 159.62 (CuSO4) + 90.10 (5H2O) = 249.72 g/mol\n\nThe molar mass of copper (II) sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO4·5H2O) is 249.72 g/mol."
