    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the vaporization of 50.0 g of water, we first need to determine the number of moles of water present. \n\nThe molar mass of water (H2O) is approximately 18.015 g/mol. \n\nNumber of moles = mass / molar mass\nNumber of moles = 50.0 g / 18.015 g/mol = 2.776 moles\n\nNow, we can use the molar enthalpy of vaporization to find the total enthalpy change.\n\nStandard enthalpy change = number of moles × molar enthalpy of vaporization\nStandard enthalpy change = 2.776 moles × 40.7 kJ/mol = 112.98 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the vaporization of 50.0 g of water at a temperature of 298.15 K and a pressure of 1 atm is approximately 112.98 kJ."
