    "message_2": "The balanced chemical equation for the precipitation reaction between silver nitrate (AgNO3) and sodium chloride (NaCl) is:\n\nAgNO3(aq) + NaCl(aq) → AgCl(s) + NaNO3(aq)\n\nTo determine how many moles of silver chloride (AgCl) can be produced from 2.5 grams of AgNO3, first, we need to find the molar mass of AgNO3:\n\nAg = 107.87 g/mol\nN = 14.01 g/mol\nO = 16.00 g/mol\n\nMolar mass of AgNO3 = 107.87 + 14.01 + (3 × 16.00) = 169.88 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the moles of AgNO3:\n\nmoles of AgNO3 = mass of AgNO3 / molar mass of AgNO3\nmoles of AgNO3 = 2.5 g / 169.88 g/mol = 0.0147 mol\n\nSince the balanced equation shows a 1:1 ratio between AgNO3 and AgCl, the moles of AgCl produced will be equal to the moles of AgNO3:\n\nmoles of AgCl = 0.0147 mol\n\nTherefore, 0.0147 moles of silver chloride can be produced from 2.5 grams of AgNO3 and an excess of NaCl."
