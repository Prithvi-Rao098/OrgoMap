    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction, we can use the formula:\n\nKc = [CH4][H2O] / ([CO][H2]^3)\n\nWe are given the equilibrium concentrations of CO, H2, CH4, and H2O as 0.06 M, 0.045 M, 0.14 M, and 0.14 M, respectively. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nKc = (0.14)(0.14) / ((0.06)(0.045)^3)\n\nKc = 0.0196 / (0.06 × 9.1125 × 10^(-5))\n\nKc = 0.0196 / 5.4675 × 10^(-6)\n\nKc ≈ 3581\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction at 100°C is approximately 3581."
