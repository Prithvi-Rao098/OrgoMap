    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change of precipitation, we first need to determine the limiting reactant and the number of moles of the product (BaSO4) formed.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nBaCl2(aq) + Na2SO4(aq) → BaSO4(s) + 2NaCl(aq)\n\nFirst, we'll find the moles of each reactant:\n\nMoles of BaCl2 = (Volume × Molarity) = (50 mL × 0.1 M) = 5 mmol\nMoles of Na2SO4 = (Volume × Molarity) = (25 mL × 0.2 M) = 5 mmol\n\nNow, we'll determine the limiting reactant by comparing the mole ratio:\n\nMole ratio of BaCl2 to Na2SO4 = 1:1\n\nSince both reactants have the same number of moles and the mole ratio is 1:1, neither reactant is in excess, and both are limiting reactants. Therefore, 5 mmol of BaSO4 will be formed.\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change of precipitation:\n\nΔH = moles of BaSO4 × ΔH˚f of BaSO4\nΔH = 5 mmol × (-1464 kJ/mol)\n\nSince we have the moles in mmol, we need to convert kJ/mol to kJ/mmol:\n\nΔH = 5 mmol × (-1.464 kJ/mmol) = -7.32 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change of precipitation when 50 mL of 0.1 M BaCl2 is mixed with 25 mL of 0.2 M Na2SO4 is -7.32 kJ."
