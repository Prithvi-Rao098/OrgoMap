    "message_2": "To determine the age of the fossil, we can use the formula for radioactive decay:\n\nN = N0 * (1/2)^(t / t_half)\n\nWhere:\nN = the final amount of Carbon-14 (20 grams)\nN0 = the initial amount of Carbon-14\nt = time elapsed (which we want to find)\nt_half = half-life of Carbon-14 (5730 years)\n\nWe know that the fossil contains 2.5% of the original amount of Carbon-14, so we can write:\n\n20 grams = N0 * 0.025\n\nFrom this equation, we can find the initial amount of Carbon-14 (N0):\n\nN0 = 20 grams / 0.025 = 800 grams\n\nNow we can plug the values into the radioactive decay formula:\n\n20 = 800 * (1/2)^(t / 5730)\n\nTo solve for t, we can first divide both sides by 800:\n\n0.025 = (1/2)^(t / 5730)\n\nNow we can take the logarithm of both sides to solve for t:\n\nlog(0.025) = (t / 5730) * log(1/2)\n\nt / 5730 = log(0.025) / log(1/2)\n\nt = 5730 * (log(0.025) / log(1/2))\n\nt â‰ˆ 16740.6 years\n\nSo, the age of the fossil is approximately 16,740 years."
