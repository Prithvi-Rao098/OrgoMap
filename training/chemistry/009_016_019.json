    "message_2": "To convert the decay energy from kiloelectronvolts (keV) to electronvolts (eV), you simply multiply by 1000, since there are 1000 eV in 1 keV.\n\nSo, for a decay energy of 2715 keV:\n\nEnergy (eV) = 2715 keV Ã— 1000 eV/keV = 2715000 eV\n\nThe energy of the gamma ray emitted by the radioactive nucleus is 2,715,000 electronvolts (eV)."
