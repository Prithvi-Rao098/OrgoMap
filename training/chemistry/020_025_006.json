    "message_2": "The reaction between iodine (I2) and iodide ions (I-) can be represented by the following balanced chemical equation:\n\nI2 (aq) + 2I- (aq) â‡Œ 3I- (aq)\n\nThis reaction represents the formation of triiodide ions (I3-) from iodine and iodide ions. The equilibrium constant expression for this reaction can be written as:\n\nKc = [I3-] / ([I2] * [I-]^2)\n\nTo calculate the equilibrium constant (Kc) at a given temperature, we need the concentrations of the species involved in the reaction at equilibrium. Since this information is not provided, I cannot calculate the exact value of Kc. However, I can provide some general information.\n\nThe reaction between iodine and iodide ions is an example of a weak oxidizing agent, as iodine is not a strong oxidizer. Therefore, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for this reaction is expected to be relatively small, indicating that the reaction does not proceed to a significant extent. The exact value of Kc will depend on the temperature, as the equilibrium constant is temperature-dependent."
