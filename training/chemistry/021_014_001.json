    "message_2": "The VSEPR geometry of the molecule BF3 (boron trifluoride) is trigonal planar. In this molecule, boron has three bonding electron pairs with three fluorine atoms and no lone pairs, resulting in a total of three electron groups. According to the VSEPR theory, these electron groups will arrange themselves in a way that minimizes repulsion, leading to a trigonal planar geometry with bond angles of approximately 120 degrees."
