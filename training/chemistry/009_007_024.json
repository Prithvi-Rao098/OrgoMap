    "message_2": "Thorium-230 (Th-230) decays through alpha decay, which is a mode of radioactive decay where the nucleus emits an alpha particle (consisting of 2 protons and 2 neutrons). The final product of its radioactive decay is radium-226 (Ra-226). The decay equation for Th-230 is:\n\nTh-230 → Ra-226 + α (alpha particle)\n\nIn this decay process, the thorium-230 nucleus loses 2 protons and 2 neutrons, transforming into radium-226."
