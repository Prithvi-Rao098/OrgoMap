    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy of formation (ΔH°f) of magnesium oxide (MgO) using Hess's Law, we need to manipulate the given reactions to obtain the desired reaction for the formation of MgO.\n\nThe desired reaction is:\nMg(s) + 1/2O2(g) → MgO(s)\n\nThe second reaction given is already in the desired form:\nMg(s) + 1/2O2(g) → MgO(s)     ΔH° = -601.8 kJ/mol\n\nSince the desired reaction is the same as the second reaction given, the standard enthalpy of formation (ΔH°f) of magnesium oxide (MgO) is:\n\nΔH°f (MgO) = -601.8 kJ/mol"
