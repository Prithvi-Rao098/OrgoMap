    "message_2": "To calculate the nuclear binding energy per nucleon of a helium-4 nucleus, we first need to find the mass defect, which is the difference between the mass of the individual nucleons and the mass of the helium-4 nucleus.\n\nThe helium-4 nucleus consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So, the total mass of the individual nucleons is:\n\nMass of 2 protons = 2 * 1.007825 u = 2.015650 u\nMass of 2 neutrons = 2 * 1.008665 u = 2.017330 u\n\nTotal mass of individual nucleons = 2.015650 u + 2.017330 u = 4.032980 u\n\nNow, we can find the mass defect:\n\nMass defect = Total mass of individual nucleons - Mass of helium-4 nucleus\nMass defect = 4.032980 u - 4.002603 u = 0.030377 u\n\nNext, we convert the mass defect to energy using the mass-energy equivalence formula, E=mc^2. Here, m is the mass defect, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3.0 x 10^8 m/s). We will also need to convert the atomic mass unit (u) to kilograms (kg) using the conversion factor 1 u = 1.66054 x 10^-27 kg.\n\nMass defect in kg = 0.030377 u * (1.66054 x 10^-27 kg/u) = 5.045 x 10^-29 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the binding energy:\n\nBinding energy = (5.045 x 10^-29 kg) * (3.0 x 10^8 m/s)^2 = 4.540 x 10^-12 Joules\n\nFinally, we can find the binding energy per nucleon by dividing the binding energy by the number of nucleons in the helium-4 nucleus (4 nucleons):\n\nBinding energy per nucleon = (4.540 x 10^-12 Joules) / 4 = 1.135 x 10^-12 Joules per nucleon"
