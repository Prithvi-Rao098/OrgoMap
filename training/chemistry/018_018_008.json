    "message_2": "Altering the concentration of reactants and products in a reversible reaction can affect both the position of the equilibrium and the reaction rate, but it does not change the equilibrium constant.\n\n1. Effect on equilibrium position:\nAccording to Le Chatelier's principle, if a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in concentration of reactants or products, the system will adjust itself to counteract the change and re-establish a new equilibrium position.\n\n- If the concentration of reactants is increased, the system will shift towards the products to counteract the change, thus increasing the concentration of products.\n- If the concentration of products is increased, the system will shift towards the reactants to counteract the change, thus increasing the concentration of reactants.\n\n2. Effect on reaction rate:\nThe reaction rate is directly proportional to the concentration of reactants. Therefore, increasing the concentration of reactants will increase the reaction rate, while decreasing the concentration of reactants will decrease the reaction rate.\n\n- If the concentration of reactants is increased, the reaction rate will increase, as there are more reactant molecules available to collide and react with each other.\n- If the concentration of products is increased, the reverse reaction rate will increase, as there are more product molecules available to collide and react with each other, converting back to reactants.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the equilibrium constant (K) remains unchanged when the concentration of reactants or products is altered. The equilibrium constant is only affected by changes in temperature."
