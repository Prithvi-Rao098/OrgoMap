    "message_2": "To determine the efficiency of a Geiger-Muller (GM) tube detector for beta particles, we need to know the count rate of the detector and the activity of the source. The efficiency can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nEfficiency = (Count rate / Activity) * 100%\n\nFirst, we need to convert the activity of the source from µCi to Bq (Becquerel):\n\n1 µCi = 37,000 Bq\n\n100 µCi = 100 * 37,000 Bq = 3,700,000 Bq\n\nNow, we need to determine the count rate of the GM tube detector. This can be done using the following formula:\n\nCount rate = (Activity * Solid angle * Detector area) / (4 * π * Distance²)\n\nHowever, we don't have enough information to calculate the count rate directly. The solid angle and detector area are not provided, and these values depend on the specific GM tube detector being used.\n\nIf you can provide the solid angle and detector area for the GM tube detector, we can proceed with the calculation. Otherwise, it's not possible to determine the efficiency of the GM tube detector for beta particles with the given information."
