    "message_2": "To determine the yield of benzocaine synthesized from 5 grams of p-aminobenzoic acid and 10 ml of ethanol, we need to first determine the limiting reagent and then calculate the theoretical yield based on the stoichiometry of the reaction.\n\nThe reaction for the synthesis of benzocaine (ethyl p-aminobenzoate) from p-aminobenzoic acid and ethanol is as follows:\n\np-aminobenzoic acid + ethanol → benzocaine + water\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of each reactant:\n\nMolar mass of p-aminobenzoic acid (C7H7NO2) = 7(12.01) + 7(1.01) + 1(14.01) + 2(16.00) = 137.14 g/mol\nMoles of p-aminobenzoic acid = 5 g / 137.14 g/mol = 0.0364 mol\n\nDensity of ethanol (C2H5OH) = 0.789 g/ml\nMass of ethanol = 10 ml × 0.789 g/ml = 7.89 g\nMolar mass of ethanol = 2(12.01) + 6(1.01) + 1(16.00) = 46.07 g/mol\nMoles of ethanol = 7.89 g / 46.07 g/mol = 0.1712 mol\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, we can see that p-aminobenzoic acid is the limiting reagent.\n\nNow, we can calculate the theoretical yield of benzocaine:\n\nMolar mass of benzocaine (C9H11NO2) = 9(12.01) + 11(1.01) + 1(14.01) + 2(16.00) = 165.19 g/mol\nTheoretical yield of benzocaine = 0.0364 mol × 165.19 g/mol = 6.01 g\n\nHowever, we need to consider the reaction condition and its efficiency. If you have a specific percentage yield for the reaction condition, you can multiply the theoretical yield by that percentage to get the actual yield. For example, if the reaction has an 80% yield under the specific condition:\n\nActual yield of benzocaine = 6.01 g × 0.80 = 4.81 g\n\nSo, under the specific reaction condition with an 80% yield, you can synthesize approximately 4.81 grams of benzocaine from 5 grams of p-aminobenzoic acid and 10 ml of ethanol."
