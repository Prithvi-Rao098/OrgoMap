    "message_2": "To determine the stoichiometric ratio of benzyl chloride and ammonia required to prepare a 100 g sample of phenylalanine through the Strecker synthesis method, we first need to know the molecular weights of the compounds involved and the balanced chemical equation for the reaction.\n\n1. Molecular weights:\n- Benzyl chloride (C6H5CH2Cl): 126.59 g/mol\n- Ammonia (NH3): 17.03 g/mol\n- Phenylalanine (C9H11NO2): 165.19 g/mol\n\n2. Balanced chemical equation for the Strecker synthesis of phenylalanine:\nC6H5CH2CN + 2 NH3 + H2O → C9H11NO2 + NH4Cl\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that one mole of benzyl chloride reacts with two moles of ammonia to produce one mole of phenylalanine.\n\n3. Calculate the moles of phenylalanine required to prepare a 100 g sample:\nmoles of phenylalanine = mass / molecular weight\nmoles of phenylalanine = 100 g / 165.19 g/mol = 0.605 moles\n\n4. Calculate the moles of benzyl chloride and ammonia required:\nSince the stoichiometric ratio of benzyl chloride to phenylalanine is 1:1, the moles of benzyl chloride required are the same as the moles of phenylalanine.\nmoles of benzyl chloride = 0.605 moles\n\nThe stoichiometric ratio of ammonia to phenylalanine is 2:1, so the moles of ammonia required are twice the moles of phenylalanine.\nmoles of ammonia = 2 × 0.605 moles = 1.21 moles\n\n5. Calculate the mass of benzyl chloride and ammonia required:\nmass of benzyl chloride = moles × molecular weight\nmass of benzyl chloride = 0.605 moles × 126.59 g/mol = 76.59 g\n\nmass of ammonia = moles × molecular weight\nmass of ammonia = 1.21 moles × 17.03 g/mol = 20.60 g\n\nTherefore, to prepare a 100 g sample of phenylalanine through the Strecker synthesis method, 76.59 g of benzyl chloride and 20.60 g of ammonia are required."
