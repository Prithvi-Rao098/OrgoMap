    "message_2": "To find the value of the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction, we can use the formula:\n\nKc = [Products]^coefficients / [Reactants]^coefficients\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g)\n\nKc = [NH3]^2 / ([N2] * [H2]^3)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given concentrations:\n\nKc = ([1.00 mol/L]^2) / ([0.50 mol/L] * [0.25 mol/L]^3)\n\nKc = (1.00^2) / (0.50 * 0.25^3)\n\nKc = 1 / (0.50 * 0.015625)\n\nKc = 1 / 0.0078125\n\nKc ≈ 128\n\nSo, the value of the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction at 25°C is approximately 128."
