    "message_1": "What is the enthalpy of vaporization of water at 100°C if it requires 40.7 kJ of energy to vaporize 1 mole of water?",
    "message_2": "The enthalpy of vaporization (ΔHvap) is the amount of energy required to convert 1 mole of a substance from the liquid phase to the gas phase at a constant temperature. In this case, the energy required to vaporize 1 mole of water at 100°C is given as 40.7 kJ.\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy of vaporization of water at 100°C is 40.7 kJ/mol."
