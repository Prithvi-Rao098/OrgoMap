Calculate the equilibrium constant (K) of the reaction at 25°C and at 50°C assuming ∆H° and ∆S° values are -32 kJ/mol and -50 J/K•mol, respectively.",
    "message_2": "To determine the effect of increasing the temperature on the formation of the complex ion [Fe(CN)6]4-, we can use the Van't Hoff equation, which relates the change in temperature to the change in the equilibrium constant (K) of a reaction.\n\nThe Van't Hoff equation is:\n\nln(K2/K1) = -∆H°/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere K1 and K2 are the equilibrium constants at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively, ∆H° is the standard enthalpy change of the reaction, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/K•mol), and T1 and T2 are the initial and final temperatures in Kelvin.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the equilibrium constant (K) at 25°C (298 K). We can use the Gibbs free energy equation:\n\n∆G° = -RT * ln(K)\n\nwhere ∆G° is the standard Gibbs free energy change, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and K is the equilibrium constant. We can calculate ∆G° using the equation:\n\n∆G° = ∆H° - T∆S°\n\nGiven that ∆H° = -32 kJ/mol and ∆S° = -50 J/K•mol, we can calculate ∆G° at 298 K:\n\n∆G° = (-32,000 J/mol) - (298 K * -50 J/K•mol) = -32,000 J/mol + 14,900 J/mol = -17,100 J/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the equilibrium constant (K) at 298 K:\n\n-17,100 J/mol = -(8.314 J/K•mol)(298 K) * ln(K)\nln(K) = 6.89\nK = e^6.89 ≈ 980\n\nNow, we can use the Van't Hoff equation to calculate the equilibrium constant (K) at 50°C (323 K):\n\nln(K2/980) = -(-32,000 J/mol) / (8.314 J/K•mol) * (1/323 K - 1/298 K)\nln(K2/980) = 2.05\nK2 = 980 * e^2.05 ≈ 2,380\n\nThe equilibrium constant (K) at 25°C is 980, and at 50°C, it is 2,380. Since the equilibrium constant (K) increases with increasing temperature, the formation of the complex ion [Fe(CN)6]4- is favored at higher temperatures."
