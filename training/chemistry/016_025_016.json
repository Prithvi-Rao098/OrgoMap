Given that the specific heat of water is 4.18 J/g°C and the density of water is 1.00 g/mL. (Assume that the heat evolved from NaOH is absorbed by the water.)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the dissolution of NaOH in water, we can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat absorbed or released, m is the mass of the substance, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nIn this case, we are given the mass of water (100.0 g), the specific heat capacity of water (4.18 J/g°C), and the change in temperature (-3.45°C). We can plug these values into the formula:\n\nq = (100.0 g)(4.18 J/g°C)(-3.45°C)\n\nq = -1441.7 J\n\nSince the temperature change is negative, the dissolution of NaOH in water is exothermic, meaning heat is released. Therefore, the enthalpy change for the dissolution of 5.00 g of NaOH in 100.0 g of water is -1441.7 J.\n\nIf you want to express the enthalpy change per mole of NaOH, you can divide the enthalpy change by the moles of NaOH dissolved:\n\nMolar mass of NaOH = 22.99 g/mol (Na) + 15.999 g/mol (O) + 1.007 g/mol (H) = 39.996 g/mol\n\nMoles of NaOH = 5.00 g / 39.996 g/mol = 0.125 mol\n\nEnthalpy change per mole of NaOH = -1441.7 J / 0.125 mol = -11533.6 J/mol or -11.53 kJ/mol"
