    "message_2": "To find the solubility of calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) in water at 25°C, we can use the solubility product constant (Ksp) expression. The balanced chemical equation for the dissolution of Ca(OH)2 in water is:\n\nCa(OH)2 (s) ⇌ Ca²⁺ (aq) + 2OH⁻ (aq)\n\nLet's denote the solubility of Ca(OH)2 as \"s\" mol/L. When Ca(OH)2 dissolves, it produces one Ca²⁺ ion and two OH⁻ ions. Therefore, the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions will be \"s\" mol/L, and the concentration of OH⁻ ions will be \"2s\" mol/L.\n\nNow, we can write the Ksp expression:\n\nKsp = [Ca²⁺] * [OH⁻]^2\n\nGiven that Ksp for Ca(OH)2 is 5.5 × 10^-6, we can substitute the concentrations of the ions in terms of \"s\":\n\n5.5 × 10^-6 = (s) * (2s)^2\n\nNow, we can solve for \"s\":\n\n5.5 × 10^-6 = 4s^3\ns^3 = (5.5 × 10^-6) / 4\ns^3 = 1.375 × 10^-6\ns = (1.375 × 10^-6)^(1/3)\ns ≈ 0.0111 mol/L\n\nSo, the solubility of calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) in water at 25°C is approximately 0.0111 mol/L."
