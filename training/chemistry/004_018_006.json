    "message_1": "A chemistry student needs to determine the concentration of silver nitrate (AgNO3) in a given sample from the following information:\n\n- A 10 mL sample of 0.1 M sodium chloride (NaCl) was mixed with excess silver nitrate.\n- The resulting precipitate was filtered, washed, and dried. The mass of the precipitate was found to be 0.212 g.\n- The molar mass of AgNO3 is 169.87 g/mol.\n\nWhat is the concentration of AgNO3 in the original sample?",
    "message_2": "First, we need to determine the moles of NaCl in the 10 mL sample. We can do this using the given concentration of NaCl:\n\nmoles of NaCl = volume (L) × concentration (M)\nmoles of NaCl = 0.010 L × 0.1 M = 0.001 moles\n\nNext, we need to consider the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between NaCl and AgNO3:\n\nNaCl (aq) + AgNO3 (aq) → AgCl (s) + NaNO3 (aq)\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of NaCl reacts with 1 mole of AgNO3 to produce 1 mole of AgCl. Therefore, the moles of AgCl produced are equal to the moles of NaCl:\n\nmoles of AgCl = 0.001 moles\n\nNow, we can use the mass of the precipitate (AgCl) and its molar mass to determine the moles of AgCl:\n\nmolar mass of AgCl = molar mass of Ag + molar mass of Cl = 107.87 g/mol (Ag) + 35.45 g/mol (Cl) = 143.32 g/mol\n\nmoles of AgCl = mass of AgCl / molar mass of AgCl\nmoles of AgCl = 0.212 g / 143.32 g/mol = 0.00148 moles\n\nSince the moles of AgCl are equal to the moles of AgNO3, we have:\n\nmoles of AgNO3 = 0.00148 moles\n\nNow, we need to determine the volume of the original AgNO3 sample. Since the reaction goes to completion, the moles of AgNO3 in the original sample are equal to the moles of NaCl:\n\nmoles of AgNO3 = moles of NaCl = 0.001 moles\n\nTo find the concentration of AgNO3 in the original sample, we can use the formula:\n\nconcentration (M) = moles / volume (L)\n\nWe know the moles of AgNO3, but we need to find the volume of the original sample. Since the reaction goes to completion, the volume of the original AgNO3 sample is equal to the volume of the NaCl sample:\n\nvolume of AgNO3 = volume of NaCl = 0.010 L\n\nNow, we can find the concentration of AgNO3:\n\nconcentration of AgNO3 = moles of AgNO3 / volume of AgNO3\nconcentration of AgNO3 = 0.00148 moles / 0.010 L = 0.148 M\n\nTherefore, the concentration of AgNO3 in the original sample is 0.148 M."
