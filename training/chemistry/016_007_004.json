    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy of formation of methane (ΔHf°(CH4)), we can use the following equation for the combustion of methane:\n\nCH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l)\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for this reaction (ΔH°) is given as -890.4 kJ/mol. We also know the standard enthalpy of formation of H2O (ΔHf°(H2O)) is -286.0 kJ/mol. We can use Hess's Law to find the standard enthalpy of formation of methane (ΔHf°(CH4)).\n\nHess's Law states that the total enthalpy change for a reaction is the sum of the enthalpy changes of formation for the products minus the sum of the enthalpy changes of formation for the reactants:\n\nΔH° = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants)\n\nFor the combustion of methane:\n\nΔH° = [ΔHf°(CO2) + 2ΔHf°(H2O)] - [ΔHf°(CH4) + 2ΔHf°(O2)]\n\nSince O2 is an element in its standard state, its enthalpy of formation is zero:\n\nΔHf°(O2) = 0\n\nNow we can plug in the given values:\n\n-890.4 kJ/mol = [ΔHf°(CO2) + 2(-286.0 kJ/mol)] - [ΔHf°(CH4)]\n\nWe need to find the standard enthalpy of formation of CO2 (ΔHf°(CO2)). The standard enthalpy of formation of CO2 is -393.5 kJ/mol. Now we can plug this value into the equation:\n\n-890.4 kJ/mol = [-393.5 kJ/mol + 2(-286.0 kJ/mol)] - [ΔHf°(CH4)]\n\n-890.4 kJ/mol = [-393.5 kJ/mol - 572.0 kJ/mol] - [ΔHf°(CH4)]\n\n-890.4 kJ/mol = [-965.5 kJ/mol] - [ΔHf°(CH4)]\n\nNow, we can solve for ΔHf°(CH4):\n\nΔHf°(CH4) = -965.5 kJ/mol + 890.4 kJ/mol\n\nΔHf°(CH4) = -75.1 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation of methane (CH4) is -75.1 kJ/mol."
