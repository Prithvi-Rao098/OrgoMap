    "message_2": "HClO4 (perchloric acid) is a strong acid, which means it completely dissociates in water. The dissociation equation is:\n\nHClO4 â†’ H+ + ClO4-\n\nSince the concentration of HClO4 is 0.1M, the concentration of H+ ions will also be 0.1M. To find the pH of the solution, we can use the pH formula:\n\npH = -log10[H+]\n\npH = -log10(0.1)\n\npH = 1\n\nThe expected pH of a 0.1M solution of HClO4 is 1."
