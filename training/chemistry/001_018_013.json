    "message_2": "To find the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid, we need to first find the concentration of hydrogen ions [H+] in the solution. We can do this using the Ka expression and an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium).\n\nThe Ka expression for acetic acid (CH3COOH) is:\n\nKa = [CH3COO-][H+] / [CH3COOH]\n\nGiven Ka = 1.8 x 10^-5\n\nLet x be the concentration of [H+] and [CH3COO-] at equilibrium. The ICE table will look like this:\n\n         CH3COOH  ↔  CH3COO-  +  H+\nInitial:  0.1 M         0 M         0 M\nChange:  -x           +x          +x\nEquilibrium: 0.1-x M     x M         x M\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Ka expression:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 = (x)(x) / (0.1 - x)\n\nSince Ka is very small, we can assume that x is also very small compared to 0.1, so we can approximate (0.1 - x) ≈ 0.1:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 = x^2 / 0.1\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx^2 = 1.8 x 10^-5 * 0.1\nx^2 = 1.8 x 10^-6\nx = sqrt(1.8 x 10^-6)\nx ≈ 1.34 x 10^-3\n\nNow that we have the concentration of hydrogen ions [H+], we can find the pH using the pH formula:\n\npH = -log10[H+]\n\npH = -log10(1.34 x 10^-3)\npH ≈ 2.87\n\nSo, the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid at 25°C is approximately 2.87."
