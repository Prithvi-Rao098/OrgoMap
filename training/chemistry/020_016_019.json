    "message_2": "To determine the effect of increasing the concentration of sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) on the solubility of calcium sulfate (CaSO4) in water, we can use the concept of the common ion effect and the solubility product constant (Ksp).\n\nThe solubility product constant (Ksp) for CaSO4 is 2.4 x 10^(-5) at 25°C. The dissolution of CaSO4 in water can be represented by the following equilibrium equation:\n\nCaSO4 (s) ⇌ Ca²⁺ (aq) + SO₄²⁻ (aq)\n\nWhen sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) is added to the solution, it dissociates into its ions:\n\nNa2SO4 (s) → 2Na⁺ (aq) + SO₄²⁻ (aq)\n\nThe increase in the concentration of sulfate ions (SO₄²⁻) from Na2SO4 will shift the equilibrium of CaSO4 dissolution to the left, according to Le Chatelier's principle, which states that a system at equilibrium will adjust to minimize the effect of a change in conditions. This means that the solubility of CaSO4 will decrease.\n\nTo calculate the new solubility of CaSO4, let's assume that the initial concentration of Na2SO4 is 0.1 M, and we want to find the new solubility of CaSO4 (x) in this solution.\n\nThe Ksp expression for CaSO4 is:\n\nKsp = [Ca²⁺][SO₄²⁻]\n\nSince the concentration of SO₄²⁻ ions from Na2SO4 is much greater than the concentration of SO₄²⁻ ions from CaSO4, we can approximate the total concentration of SO₄²⁻ ions as 0.1 M. Therefore, the Ksp expression becomes:\n\n2.4 x 10^(-5) = [Ca²⁺](0.1)\n\nTo find the new solubility of CaSO4 (x), we can solve for [Ca²⁺]:\n\n[Ca²⁺] = (2.4 x 10^(-5))/0.1\n[Ca²⁺] = 2.4 x 10^(-4) M\n\nThus, the new solubility of CaSO4 in the presence of 0.1 M Na2SO4 is 2.4 x 10^(-4) M, which is lower than its solubility in pure water. This demonstrates that the solubility of CaSO4 decreases when the concentration of sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) is increased."
