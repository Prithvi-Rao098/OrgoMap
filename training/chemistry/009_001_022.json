    "message_2": "To calculate the activity of the sample after 5000 years, we can use the radioactive decay formula:\n\nA = A0 * (1/2)^(t/T)\n\nwhere:\nA = activity after time t\nA0 = initial activity (800 Bq)\nt = time elapsed (5000 years)\nT = half-life of carbon-14 (5730 years)\n\nA = 800 * (1/2)^(5000/5730)\n\nA ≈ 800 * (1/2)^0.872\n\nA ≈ 800 * 0.543\n\nA ≈ 434.4 Bq\n\nThe activity of the sample after 5000 years is approximately 434.4 Bq."
