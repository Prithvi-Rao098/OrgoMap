    "message_2": "To calculate the formal charge on the nitrogen atom in the NO3- molecule, we can use the following formula:\n\nFormal charge = (Valence electrons of the atom) - (Non-bonding electrons) - 0.5 * (Bonding electrons)\n\nIn the NO3- molecule, nitrogen is the central atom, and it is bonded to three oxygen atoms. Nitrogen has 5 valence electrons, and each oxygen atom has 6 valence electrons. The molecule has a single negative charge, which means there is an extra electron in the molecule.\n\nSince nitrogen is bonded to three oxygen atoms, there are three single bonds, which means there are 2 * 3 = 6 bonding electrons. Nitrogen does not have any non-bonding electrons (lone pairs) in this molecule.\n\nNow, we can calculate the formal charge on the nitrogen atom:\n\nFormal charge = (5) - (0) - 0.5 * (6)\nFormal charge = 5 - 0 - 3\nFormal charge = 2\n\nSo, the formal charge on the nitrogen atom in the NO3- molecule is +1."
