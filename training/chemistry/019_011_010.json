    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy of formation for propene (C3H6), we can use the following equation:\n\nΔHf (propene) = ΔHc (propene) + Σ [ΔHf (products)] - Σ [ΔHf (reactants)]\n\nThe balanced combustion reaction for propene is:\n\nC3H6 + 9/2 O2 → 3 CO2 + 3 H2O\n\nThe standard enthalpy of combustion of propene (ΔHc) is given as -1411.1 kJ/mol.\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation of CO2 (ΔHf) is given as -393.5 kJ/mol, and for H2O (ΔHf) is -285.8 kJ/mol.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔHf (propene) = -1411.1 kJ/mol + [3(-393.5 kJ/mol) + 3(-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [ΔHf (propene) + 0]\n\nNote that the standard enthalpy of formation for O2 is 0 since it is in its elemental form.\n\nSolving for ΔHf (propene):\n\nΔHf (propene) = -1411.1 kJ/mol + [-1180.5 kJ/mol - 857.4 kJ/mol] - ΔHf (propene)\n\nCombine the terms:\n\n2ΔHf (propene) = -1411.1 kJ/mol + (-2037.9 kJ/mol)\n\n2ΔHf (propene) = 626.8 kJ/mol\n\nNow, divide by 2 to find the standard enthalpy of formation for propene:\n\nΔHf (propene) = 313.4 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy of formation for propene (C3H6) is 313.4 kJ/mol."
