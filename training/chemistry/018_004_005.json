    "message_2": "The Arrhenius equation is given by:\n\nk = Ae^(-Ea/RT)\n\nwhere k is the rate constant, A is the pre-exponential factor, Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol/K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nWe are given the rate constants at two different temperatures, 25°C (298.15 K) and 35°C (308.15 K). We can set up two equations using the Arrhenius equation for each temperature:\n\nk1 = Ae^(-Ea/R * T1)\nk2 = Ae^(-Ea/R * T2)\n\nwhere k1 = 5.5 x 10^-3 L/mol/s, k2 = 1.65 x 10^-2 L/mol/s, T1 = 298.15 K, and T2 = 308.15 K.\n\nWe can solve for the activation energy (Ea) by dividing the second equation by the first equation:\n\n(k2/k1) = e^(-Ea/R * (1/T1 - 1/T2))\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(k2/k1) = -Ea/R * (1/T1 - 1/T2)\n\nNow, we can solve for Ea:\n\nEa = -R * ln(k2/k1) / (1/T1 - 1/T2)\n\nPlugging in the given values and the gas constant:\n\nEa = -8.314 J/mol/K * ln(1.65 x 10^-2 / 5.5 x 10^-3) / (1/298.15 - 1/308.15)\n\nEa ≈ 49069.5 J/mol\n\nThe activation energy for the reaction between hydrogen peroxide and iodide ions is approximately 49.1 kJ/mol."
