    "message_2": "To determine the purity of a sample of aspirin obtained from a local pharmacy and compare it to the recorded purity on the label, you can use melting point determination. Here's how to do it:\n\n1. Obtain a sample of aspirin from the local pharmacy and note the purity recorded on the label.\n\n2. Crush a small amount of the aspirin sample into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle.\n\n3. Prepare a capillary tube by sealing one end and filling it with the crushed aspirin powder. Tap the tube gently to ensure the powder settles at the bottom.\n\n4. Set up a melting point apparatus, such as a Thiele tube or a digital melting point apparatus, and heat the sample at a slow and steady rate (about 1-2°C per minute).\n\n5. Observe the temperature at which the aspirin begins to melt (the onset of melting) and the temperature at which it completely melts (the end of melting). Record these temperatures as the melting point range.\n\n6. Compare the observed melting point range of the aspirin sample to the known melting point range of pure aspirin, which is 138-140°C. If the sample's melting point range is close to the known range, it indicates high purity. If the melting point range is lower or broader than the known range, it suggests the presence of impurities.\n\n7. Compare the observed melting point range to the purity recorded on the label. If the observed range is consistent with the label's purity, it confirms the accuracy of the label. If not, it suggests a discrepancy between the actual purity and the recorded purity.\n\nKeep in mind that melting point determination is a qualitative method for assessing purity, and it may not provide an exact percentage of purity. However, it can give you a good indication of the aspirin sample's purity and help you compare it to the recorded purity on the label."
