    "message_2": "To determine the amount of chlorine gas required, we first need to find the balanced chemical equation for the reaction. The reaction involves two steps: nitration of aniline and chlorination of the nitroaniline product.\n\n1. Nitration of aniline:\nAniline (C6H7N) reacts with nitric acid (HNO3) in the presence of a catalyst (sulfuric acid) to form 4-nitroaniline (C6H6N2O2) and water (H2O).\n\nC6H7N + HNO3 → C6H6N2O2 + H2O\n\n2. Chlorination of 4-nitroaniline:\n4-nitroaniline (C6H6N2O2) reacts with chlorine gas (Cl2) to form 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline (C6H5ClN2O2) and hydrogen chloride (HCl).\n\nC6H6N2O2 + Cl2 → C6H5ClN2O2 + HCl\n\nNow, we need to calculate the moles of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline required to produce 10 grams of product, considering a 90% yield.\n\nMolar mass of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline = 6(12.01) + 5(1.01) + 1(35.45) + 2(14.01) + 2(16.00) = 72.06 + 5.05 + 35.45 + 28.02 + 32.00 = 172.58 g/mol\n\nMoles of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline = (10 g) / (172.58 g/mol) = 0.0579 mol\n\nSince the yield is 90%, we need to account for this in our calculations:\n\nMoles of 4-nitroaniline required = 0.0579 mol / 0.9 = 0.0643 mol\n\nFrom the balanced equation, the mole ratio of 4-nitroaniline to chlorine gas is 1:1. Therefore, we need the same number of moles of chlorine gas:\n\nMoles of Cl2 required = 0.0643 mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the mass of chlorine gas required:\n\nMolar mass of Cl2 = 2(35.45) = 70.90 g/mol\n\nMass of Cl2 required = (0.0643 mol) × (70.90 g/mol) = 4.56 g\n\nSo, 4.56 grams of chlorine gas are required to prepare 10 grams of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline from aniline, assuming a 90% yield in the reaction."
