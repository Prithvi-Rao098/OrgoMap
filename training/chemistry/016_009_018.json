    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat required to vaporize the 50 g of water, we can use the following formula:\n\nq = n * ΔHvap\n\nwhere q is the heat required, n is the number of moles of water, and ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the number of moles of water. The molar mass of water is 18.015 g/mol. \n\nn = mass / molar mass\nn = 50 g / 18.015 g/mol\nn ≈ 2.776 moles\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat required:\n\nq = n * ΔHvap\nq = 2.776 moles * 40.7 kJ/mol\nq ≈ 112.98 kJ\n\nTherefore, approximately 112.98 kJ of heat is required to vaporize 50 g of water at its boiling point."
