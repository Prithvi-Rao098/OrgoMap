    "message_1": "What is the equilibrium constant (K) for the formation of the complex ion Cu(NH3)42+ if the concentration of Cu2+ is 0.1 M and the concentration of NH3 is 0.2 M at equilibrium? The balanced equation for the reaction is:\n\nCu2+(aq) + 4NH3(aq) â‡Œ Cu(NH3)42+(aq) \n\nThe student should use the equation and the given concentrations to calculate the equilibrium constant (K).",
    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant (K), we need to know the equilibrium concentrations of all species involved in the reaction. However, we are only given the initial concentrations of Cu2+ and NH3. To find the equilibrium concentrations, we need to set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table.\n\nLet x be the concentration of Cu(NH3)42+ at equilibrium. Then, the changes in the concentrations of the other species are as follows:\n\nCu2+: -x\nNH3: -4x\n\nThe equilibrium concentrations are:\n\n[Cu2+] = 0.1 - x\n[NH3] = 0.2 - 4x\n[Cu(NH3)42+] = x\n\nNow, we can write the expression for the equilibrium constant (K):\n\nK = [Cu(NH3)42+] / ([Cu2+] * [NH3]^4)\n\nSubstitute the equilibrium concentrations into the expression:\n\nK = (x) / ((0.1 - x) * (0.2 - 4x)^4)\n\nTo solve for K, we need more information about the equilibrium concentrations, such as the concentration of Cu(NH3)42+ at equilibrium or the value of x. Without this information, we cannot calculate the equilibrium constant (K)."
