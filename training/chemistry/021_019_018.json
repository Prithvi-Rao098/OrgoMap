    "message_2": "The solubility of potassium chloride (KCl) in water at 25°C is given as 34.21 g/100 mL of water. Since you have 100 mL of water, the maximum mass of KCl that can dissolve in it is:\n\n34.21 g KCl/100 mL water × 100 mL water = 34.21 g KCl\n\nSo, the maximum mass of potassium chloride that can dissolve in 100 mL of water at 25°C is 34.21 grams."
