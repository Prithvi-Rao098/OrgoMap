    "message_2": "The dissociation of acetic acid (CH3COOH) in water can be represented by the following chemical equation:\n\nCH3COOH (aq) ⇌ CH3COO- (aq) + H+ (aq)\n\nThe equilibrium constant expression for this reaction is given by:\n\nKc = [CH3COO-][H+] / [CH3COOH]\n\nGiven that the initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.2 M and its final concentration after dissociation is 0.01 M, we can determine the change in concentration:\n\nΔ[CH3COOH] = 0.2 M - 0.01 M = 0.19 M\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, the change in concentration of CH3COO- and H+ ions is equal to the change in concentration of CH3COOH:\n\nΔ[CH3COO-] = Δ[H+] = 0.19 M\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equilibrium constant expression:\n\nKc = (0.19)(0.19) / (0.01)\n\nKc = 0.0361\n\nSo, the value of the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the dissociation of acetic acid in water at 25°C is approximately 0.0361."
