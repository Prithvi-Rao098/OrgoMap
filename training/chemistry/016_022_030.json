Given the standard enthalpy of formation values for butene-1 as -126.3 kJ/mol and butene-2 as -126.0 kJ/mol, and the heat of combustion values for butene-1 as -2670.0 kJ/mol and butene-2 as -2666.0 kJ/mol.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the isomerization reaction of butene-1 to butene-2, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH = ΔH_f(products) - ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH_f is the standard enthalpy of formation.\n\nIn this case, the reaction is:\n\nbutene-1 → butene-2\n\nSo, the enthalpy change for the reaction is:\n\nΔH = ΔH_f(butene-2) - ΔH_f(butene-1)\n\nGiven the standard enthalpy of formation values for butene-1 as -126.3 kJ/mol and butene-2 as -126.0 kJ/mol, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔH = (-126.0 kJ/mol) - (-126.3 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH = 0.3 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy change for the isomerization reaction of butene-1 to butene-2 is 0.3 kJ/mol."
