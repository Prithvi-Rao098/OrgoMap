    "message_1": "What is the pH of a solution when the pH meter reading is 6.25 at 25°C using a pH electrode of 0.1M KCl with a temperature coefficient of 0.005 pH/°C?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the temperature coefficient and adjust the pH reading accordingly. Since the pH meter reading is taken at 25°C, we can assume that the temperature is constant and there is no need to adjust the pH value for temperature.\n\nTherefore, the pH of the solution is 6.25."
