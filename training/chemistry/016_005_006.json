    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of combustion of ethane (C2H6), we first need to determine the number of moles of ethane combusted and then use the heat produced to find the enthalpy change per mole.\n\nFirst, let's find the molar mass of ethane:\nC2H6 = (2 × 12.01 g/mol for C) + (6 × 1.01 g/mol for H) = 24.02 + 6.06 = 30.08 g/mol\n\nNow, let's find the number of moles of ethane combusted:\nmoles = mass / molar mass = 2.00 g / 30.08 g/mol = 0.0665 mol\n\nThe heat produced is given as 11.2 kJ. To find the enthalpy change per mole, we can use the following formula:\nenthalpy change = heat produced / moles\n\nenthalpy change = 11.2 kJ / 0.0665 mol = 168.42 kJ/mol\n\nSince this is a combustion reaction, the enthalpy change is negative (exothermic reaction). Therefore, the enthalpy of combustion of ethane (C2H6) is approximately -168.42 kJ/mol."
