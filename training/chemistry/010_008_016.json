    "message_1": "What is the current density in an electrochemical cell where a current of 5 amperes is passed through a copper electrode with a surface area of 0.1 square meters for 10 minutes? The half-cell reaction is:\n Cu2+ + 2 e- -> Cu.",
    "message_2": "Current density (J) is defined as the current (I) per unit area (A) of the electrode. In this case, the current (I) is 5 amperes and the surface area (A) of the copper electrode is 0.1 square meters.\n\nTo calculate the current density, use the formula:\n\nJ = I / A\n\nJ = 5 A / 0.1 m²\n\nJ = 50 A/m²\n\nSo, the current density in the electrochemical cell is 50 amperes per square meter."
