    "message_2": "The preparation of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene from nitrobenzene and chlorine gas can be carried out through electrophilic substitution reaction. Here is the step-by-step procedure:\n\n1. Set up a reaction apparatus consisting of a round-bottom flask, a dropping funnel, a condenser, and a gas inlet tube for the introduction of chlorine gas.\n\n2. Add nitrobenzene to the round-bottom flask and cool it to 0-5°C using an ice bath. This is done to control the reaction rate and minimize the formation of undesired by-products.\n\n3. Slowly introduce chlorine gas into the reaction mixture through the gas inlet tube. The electrophilic substitution reaction will occur, and the nitrobenzene will be chlorinated at the 2 and 4 positions to form 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene.\n\n4. Monitor the reaction progress using thin-layer chromatography (TLC) or another suitable analytical technique. The reaction is complete when no starting material (nitrobenzene) is detected.\n\n5. Once the reaction is complete, separate the 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene from the reaction mixture by filtration or extraction, followed by washing with water to remove any remaining inorganic salts.\n\n6. Purify the crude product by recrystallization from a suitable solvent, such as ethanol or ethyl acetate, to obtain pure 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene.\n\nPhysical and chemical properties of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene:\n\n- Molecular formula: C6H3Cl2NO2\n- Molecular weight: 202.00 g/mol\n- Appearance: Yellow to light brown crystalline solid\n- Melting point: 47-51°C\n- Boiling point: 315°C\n- Density: 1.58 g/cm³\n- Solubility: Slightly soluble in water, soluble in organic solvents like ethanol, acetone, and diethyl ether.\n- Reactivity: 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene can undergo further electrophilic substitution reactions, reduction reactions to form 2,4-dichloroaniline, and nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions.\n\nRemember to follow safety precautions and wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) when carrying out this reaction, as both nitrobenzene and chlorine gas are hazardous chemicals."
