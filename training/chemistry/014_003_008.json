    "message_2": "In the coordination compound [Co(en)2Cl2]+, there are two types of isomerism present: geometrical isomerism and optical isomerism.\n\n1. Geometrical Isomerism:\nGeometrical isomerism arises due to the different possible arrangements of the ligands around the central metal ion. In this case, the cobalt(III) ion (Co) is surrounded by two ethylenediamine (en) ligands and two chloride (Cl) ligands. The geometrical isomers can be classified into two types: cis and trans isomers.\n\n- Cis isomer: In the cis isomer, the two chloride ligands are adjacent to each other, occupying neighboring positions in the octahedral arrangement. The two ethylenediamine ligands are also adjacent to each other.\n\n- Trans isomer: In the trans isomer, the two chloride ligands are opposite to each other, occupying positions across the central metal ion. Similarly, the two ethylenediamine ligands are also opposite to each other.\n\n2. Optical Isomerism:\nOptical isomerism occurs when a compound has a non-superimposable mirror image, which means that the compound and its mirror image cannot be superimposed on each other. These non-superimposable mirror images are called enantiomers. Optical isomers are also known as chiral molecules.\n\nIn the case of [Co(en)2Cl2]+, the cis isomer exhibits optical isomerism. The ethylenediamine ligands are bidentate, which means they can bind to the central metal ion in two different ways. This results in the formation of two enantiomers, which are mirror images of each other but cannot be superimposed. These enantiomers are called the D (dextro) and L (levo) isomers.\n\nIn summary, the coordination compound [Co(en)2Cl2]+ exhibits both geometrical isomerism (cis and trans isomers) and optical isomerism (D and L enantiomers of the cis isomer)."
