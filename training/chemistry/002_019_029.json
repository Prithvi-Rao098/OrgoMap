    "message_2": "To determine the boiling point of sodium chloride (NaCl) at an external pressure of 1 atm, we need to use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates the vapor pressure of a substance at different temperatures to its heat of vaporization. However, the heat of vaporization provided (406.6 kJ/mol) is not sufficient to calculate the boiling point directly, as it only describes the energy required to vaporize the substance at its boiling point.\n\nThe Clausius-Clapeyron equation is:\n\nln(P2/P1) = (-ΔHvap/R)(1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nWhere P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, ΔHvap is the heat of vaporization, and R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K).\n\nUnfortunately, we do not have enough information to use this equation directly. We would need the vapor pressure of NaCl at a known temperature, which is not provided.\n\nHowever, we can provide some general information about the boiling point of NaCl. Sodium chloride has a very high boiling point due to its ionic nature and strong electrostatic forces between its positively charged sodium ions (Na+) and negatively charged chloride ions (Cl-). The boiling point of NaCl is approximately 1,413°C (2,575°F) at 1 atm pressure. This value is based on experimental data and is not calculated using the provided heat of vaporization."
