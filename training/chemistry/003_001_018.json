Is the reaction spontaneous or non-spontaneous under standard conditions?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard free energy change (∆G°) for the reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\n∆G° = ∆H° - T∆S°\n\nwhere ∆H° is the standard enthalpy change, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ∆S° is the standard entropy change.\n\nGiven values:\n∆H° = -890.4 kJ mol^-1\n∆S° = +292.2 J K^-1 mol^-1\nT = 298 K\n\nFirst, we need to convert the entropy change from J K^-1 mol^-1 to kJ K^-1 mol^-1:\n\n∆S° = 292.2 J K^-1 mol^-1 × (1 kJ / 1000 J) = 0.2922 kJ K^-1 mol^-1\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the equation:\n\n∆G° = (-890.4 kJ mol^-1) - (298 K × 0.2922 kJ K^-1 mol^-1)\n∆G° = -890.4 kJ mol^-1 - 87.0956 kJ mol^-1\n∆G° = -977.4956 kJ mol^-1\n\nThe standard free energy change for the reaction is approximately -977.5 kJ mol^-1.\n\nSince the ∆G° value is negative, the reaction is spontaneous under standard conditions."
