    "message_1": "What is the equilibrium concentration of hydrogen gas, H2, in a reaction vessel with an initial concentration of 0.5 M H2 and 1.0 M iodine gas, I2, where the equilibrium constant, Kc, is 54.3 at a given temperature?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the reaction equation and the equilibrium constant expression. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction between hydrogen gas and iodine gas is:\n\nH2(g) + I2(g) ⇌ 2HI(g)\n\nLet's denote the initial concentrations of H2, I2, and HI as [H2]0, [I2]0, and [HI]0, respectively. Since there is no mention of the initial concentration of HI, we can assume it to be 0 M. At equilibrium, the concentrations of H2, I2, and HI will be [H2], [I2], and [HI], respectively.\n\nWe can set up a table to represent the initial, change, and equilibrium concentrations:\n\n|      | [H2] | [I2] | [HI] |\n|------|------|------|------|\n|Initial | 0.5  | 1.0  |  0   |\n|Change  | -x   | -x   | +2x  |\n|Equilibrium | 0.5-x | 1.0-x | 2x  |\n\nNow, we can write the equilibrium constant expression using the equilibrium concentrations:\n\nKc = [HI]^2 / ([H2] * [I2])\n\nGiven Kc = 54.3, we can plug in the equilibrium concentrations:\n\n54.3 = (2x)^2 / ((0.5-x) * (1.0-x))\n\nNow, we need to solve for x:\n\n54.3 * (0.5-x) * (1.0-x) = (2x)^2\n\n27.15 - 54.3x + 54.3x^2 = 4x^2\n\n50.3x^2 - 54.3x + 27.15 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in the form of ax^2 + bx + c = 0. We can solve for x using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nx = (54.3 ± √(54.3^2 - 4*50.3*27.15)) / (2*50.3)\n\nx ≈ 0.0145 or x ≈ 1.246\n\nSince x cannot be greater than the initial concentrations of H2 and I2, we discard the second solution (x ≈ 1.246). Therefore, x ≈ 0.0145.\n\nNow we can find the equilibrium concentration of H2:\n\n[H2] = 0.5 - x ≈ 0.5 - 0.0145 ≈ 0.485 M"
