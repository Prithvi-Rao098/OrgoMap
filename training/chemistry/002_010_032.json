    "message_2": "To find the density of a substance, we can use the formula:\n\nDensity = Mass / Volume\n\nWe are given the mass of the copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate sample (10.0 grams) and its volume (8.0 mL).\n\nDensity = (10.0 grams) / (8.0 mL)\nDensity = 1.25 g/mL\n\nThe density of the copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate sample is 1.25 g/mL."
