    "message_2": "To find the pH of the buffer solution, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log ([A-]/[HA])\n\nwhere pH is the pH of the solution, pKa is the acid dissociation constant of the weak acid (acetic acid), [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate ion), and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid (acetic acid).\n\nFirst, let's find the moles of acetic acid and sodium acetate in the solution:\n\nmoles of acetic acid (HA) = volume × concentration = 50 mL × 0.1 M = 5 mmol\nmoles of sodium acetate (A-) = volume × concentration = 25 mL × 0.1 M = 2.5 mmol\n\nNow, let's find the total volume of the solution:\n\ntotal volume = volume of acetic acid + volume of sodium acetate = 50 mL + 25 mL = 75 mL\n\nNext, we'll find the concentrations of acetic acid and sodium acetate in the final solution:\n\n[HA] = moles of acetic acid / total volume = 5 mmol / 75 mL = 0.0667 M\n[A-] = moles of sodium acetate / total volume = 2.5 mmol / 75 mL = 0.0333 M\n\nNow we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log ([A-]/[HA]) = 4.76 + log (0.0333 / 0.0667) = 4.76 - 0.301 = 4.459\n\nThe pH of the buffer solution is approximately 4.46."
