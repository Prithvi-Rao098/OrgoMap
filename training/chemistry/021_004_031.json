    "message_2": "The hybridization of the nitrogen atom in ammonia (NH3) is sp3. In ammonia, nitrogen has three sigma bonds with three hydrogen atoms and one lone pair of electrons. The combination of one s orbital and three p orbitals results in four sp3 hybrid orbitals, which are used to form the three N-H sigma bonds and accommodate the lone pair of electrons."
