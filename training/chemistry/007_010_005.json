    "message_2": "The structure of an existing drug can significantly affect its toxicity in humans due to several factors:\n\n1. Molecular size and shape: The size and shape of a drug molecule can influence its ability to interact with specific target proteins or receptors in the body. If a drug molecule is too large or has an inappropriate shape, it may not fit into the binding site of its target protein, reducing its efficacy and potentially leading to toxic side effects.\n\n2. Chemical reactivity: Some drug molecules may have reactive functional groups that can form covalent bonds with biological molecules, leading to unintended interactions and potential toxicity. For example, drugs containing electrophilic groups can react with nucleophilic groups in proteins or DNA, causing damage and potentially leading to adverse effects.\n\n3. Lipophilicity: The lipophilicity of a drug molecule determines its ability to dissolve in lipids and cross biological membranes, such as the blood-brain barrier or cell membranes. Highly lipophilic drugs can accumulate in fatty tissues, leading to increased toxicity, while drugs with low lipophilicity may have difficulty reaching their target sites.\n\n4. Metabolism and elimination: The structure of a drug molecule can affect how it is metabolized and eliminated from the body. Some drug molecules may be rapidly metabolized and excreted, reducing their toxicity, while others may persist in the body and cause toxic effects. Additionally, the metabolites produced during drug metabolism can sometimes be more toxic than the parent compound.\n\n5. Stereochemistry: Many drug molecules have chiral centers, which means they can exist as two or more stereoisomers with different spatial arrangements of atoms. The biological activity and toxicity of these stereoisomers can vary significantly, as they may interact differently with target proteins or receptors.\n\n6. Polymorphism: Some drugs can exist in different solid-state forms, known as polymorphs, which can have different solubility, stability, and bioavailability. These differences can affect the drug's absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, ultimately influencing its toxicity.\n\nIn summary, the structure of an existing drug plays a crucial role in determining its toxicity in humans. Understanding these structure-toxicity relationships is essential for the design of safer and more effective drugs."
