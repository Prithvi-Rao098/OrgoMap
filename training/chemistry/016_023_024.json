    "message_2": "First, we need to correct the mistake in the problem statement. Sodium acetate is not NaOH; it is CH3COONa. Now, let's proceed with the calculation.\n\nTo calculate the enthalpy change, we need to find the heat absorbed by the solution and then divide it by the number of moles of sodium acetate.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the heat absorbed by the solution\nq = mcΔT\nwhere q is the heat absorbed, m is the mass of the solution, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nAssuming that the mass of the solution is approximately equal to the mass of sodium acetate (since the mass of water is not given), we have:\nm = 10 g\nc = 4.18 J/(g·°C)\nΔT = 30°C - 25°C = 5°C\n\nq = (10 g)(4.18 J/(g·°C))(5°C) = 209 J\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total heat involved in the reaction\nSince the heat evolved by the reaction is 677 J, the total heat involved in the reaction is the sum of the heat absorbed by the solution and the heat evolved by the reaction.\n\nTotal heat = Heat absorbed by the solution + Heat evolved by the reaction\nTotal heat = 209 J + 677 J = 886 J\n\nStep 3: Calculate the number of moles of sodium acetate\nThe molar mass of sodium acetate (CH3COONa) is approximately 82 g/mol.\n\nMoles of sodium acetate = mass / molar mass\nMoles of sodium acetate = 10 g / 82 g/mol = 0.122 mol\n\nStep 4: Calculate the enthalpy change\nEnthalpy change = Total heat / Moles of sodium acetate\nEnthalpy change = 886 J / 0.122 mol = 7260 J/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 10 grams of sodium acetate at 25°C is 7260 J/mol."
