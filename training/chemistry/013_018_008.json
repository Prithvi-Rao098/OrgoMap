The equilibrium adsorption data for Pb2+ on activated carbon is given as follows: qe (mg/g) = 200Ce/(1+10Ce), where Ce is the equilibrium concentration of lead ions in solution (in mg/L).",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum amount of lead ions (Pb2+) that can be adsorbed on 5 g of activated carbon, we need to first find the maximum adsorption capacity (qe) from the given equation:\n\nqe (mg/g) = 200Ce / (1 + 10Ce)\n\nThe maximum adsorption capacity occurs when the derivative of qe with respect to Ce is equal to zero. So, let's find the derivative:\n\nd(qe)/d(Ce) = d(200Ce / (1 + 10Ce))/d(Ce)\n\nUsing the quotient rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nd(qe)/d(Ce) = (200(1 + 10Ce) - 200Ce * 10) / (1 + 10Ce)^2\n\nNow, we set the derivative equal to zero and solve for Ce:\n\n0 = (200(1 + 10Ce) - 2000Ce) / (1 + 10Ce)^2\n\n0 = 200(1 + 10Ce) - 2000Ce\n\n2000Ce = 200 + 2000Ce\n\n200 = 2000Ce\n\nCe = 0.1 mg/L\n\nNow that we have the equilibrium concentration of lead ions (Ce), we can find the maximum adsorption capacity (qe) using the given equation:\n\nqe (mg/g) = 200 * 0.1 / (1 + 10 * 0.1)\n\nqe (mg/g) = 20 / (1 + 1)\n\nqe (mg/g) = 20 / 2\n\nqe (mg/g) = 10 mg/g\n\nFinally, we can find the maximum amount of lead ions that can be adsorbed on 5 g of activated carbon:\n\nMaximum amount of Pb2+ = qe * mass of activated carbon\n\nMaximum amount of Pb2+ = 10 mg/g * 5 g\n\nMaximum amount of Pb2+ = 50 mg"
