    "message_2": "First, we need to determine the number of moles of MgSO4 in 45 grams. The molar mass of MgSO4 is:\n\nMg = 24.3 g/mol\nS = 32.1 g/mol\nO = 16.0 g/mol (and there are 4 oxygen atoms)\n\nMolar mass of MgSO4 = 24.3 + 32.1 + (4 × 16.0) = 24.3 + 32.1 + 64.0 = 120.4 g/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of moles of MgSO4 in 45 grams:\n\nmoles = mass / molar mass = 45 g / 120.4 g/mol ≈ 0.374 moles\n\nNext, we can use the molar heat of hydration to find the heat of hydration for 0.374 moles of MgSO4:\n\nHeat of hydration = moles × molar heat of hydration = 0.374 moles × (-138.5 kJ/mol) ≈ -51.8 kJ\n\nSo, the heat of hydration of 45 grams of magnesium sulfate in 250 mL of water is approximately -51.8 kJ."
