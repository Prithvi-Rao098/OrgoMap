Calculate the equilibrium concentrations of each component at 298K if the reaction is exothermic and the pressure is increased. (Hint: Use Le Chatelier's principle to determine the direction of the shift and then use an ICE table to calculate the concentrations at equilibrium)",
    "message_2": "Le Chatelier's principle states that if a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in pressure, temperature, or concentration of reactants or products, the system will adjust its equilibrium position to counteract the change.\n\nSince the reaction is exothermic, increasing the pressure will shift the equilibrium to the side with fewer moles of gas to counteract the pressure increase. In this case, the forward reaction will be favored because there are 4 moles of gas on the reactant side and only 2 moles of gas on the product side.\n\nNow, let's set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to calculate the concentrations at equilibrium:\n\n```\n          N2    +    3H2    <->    2NH3\nInitial   0.1M         0.2M          0M\nChange   -x          -3x           +2x\nEquilibrium 0.1-x     0.2-3x        2x\n```\n\nAt equilibrium, the reaction quotient (Q) is equal to the equilibrium constant (K). Since we don't have the value of K, we cannot calculate the exact concentrations of each component at equilibrium. However, we can express the equilibrium concentrations in terms of x:\n\n[N2] = 0.1 - x\n[H2] = 0.2 - 3x\n[NH3] = 2x\n\nSince the forward reaction is favored, the concentration of N2 and H2 will decrease, and the concentration of NH3 will increase."
