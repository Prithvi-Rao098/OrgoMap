    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change of combustion for ethane, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the combustion reaction:\n\nC2H6 + O2 → 2CO2 + 3H2O\n\nNow, we can use Hess's Law, which states that the enthalpy change of a reaction is the sum of the enthalpy changes of formation of the products minus the sum of the enthalpy changes of formation of the reactants.\n\nΔH_combustion = [ΔH_f(products)] - [ΔH_f(reactants)]\n\nFor the products, we have 2 moles of CO2 and 3 moles of H2O:\n\nΔH_f(products) = (2 × -393.5 kJ/mol) + (3 × -241.8 kJ/mol) = -787 kJ/mol + (-725.4 kJ/mol) = -1512.4 kJ/mol\n\nFor the reactants, we have 1 mole of ethane and the enthalpy of formation for O2 is zero since it is an element in its standard state:\n\nΔH_f(reactants) = (-84.68 kJ/mol) + 0 = -84.68 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change of combustion:\n\nΔH_combustion = (-1512.4 kJ/mol) - (-84.68 kJ/mol) = -1427.72 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy change of combustion for ethane (C2H6) is -1427.72 kJ/mol."
