    "message_1": "What is the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of methane gas (CH4) at constant pressure if 1 mole of methane is burnt in excess oxygen gas, producing carbon dioxide gas (CO2) and water vapor (H2O)? The standard enthalpies of formation of CH4, CO2, and H2O are -74.8 kJ/mol, -393.5 kJ/mol, and -241.8 kJ/mol, respectively.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of methane gas, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH_combustion = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane is:\n\nCH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(g)\n\nNow, we can plug in the standard enthalpies of formation for each compound:\n\nΔH_combustion = [1 × (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 × (-241.8 kJ/mol)] - [1 × (-74.8 kJ/mol) + 2 × 0 kJ/mol]\n\nNote that the standard enthalpy of formation for oxygen gas (O2) is 0 kJ/mol since it is in its standard state.\n\nΔH_combustion = (-393.5 - 2 × 241.8 + 74.8) kJ/mol\n\nΔH_combustion = (-393.5 - 483.6 + 74.8) kJ/mol\n\nΔH_combustion = (-802.3) kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the combustion of methane gas (CH4) at constant pressure is -802.3 kJ/mol."
