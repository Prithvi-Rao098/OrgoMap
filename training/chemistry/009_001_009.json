    "message_2": "To calculate the half-life of the radioactive isotope, we can use the decay formula:\n\nN(t) = N0 * (1/2)^(t/T)\n\nwhere:\nN(t) is the activity at time t\nN0 is the initial activity\nt is the time elapsed (in this case, 45 minutes)\nT is the half-life of the isotope\n\nWe are given:\nN0 = 1000 Bq\nN(t) = 250 Bq\nt = 45 minutes\n\nWe need to find T (the half-life). We can rearrange the formula to solve for T:\n\nT = t * (log(1/2) / log(N(t)/N0))\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nT = 45 * (log(1/2) / log(250/1000))\nT = 45 * (log(1/2) / log(1/4))\n\nUsing a calculator to find the logarithms:\n\nT = 45 * (-0.3010 / -0.6021)\nT ≈ 45 * 0.5\n\nT ≈ 22.5 minutes\n\nThe half-life of the radioactive isotope is approximately 22.5 minutes."
