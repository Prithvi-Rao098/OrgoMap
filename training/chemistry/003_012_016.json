    "message_2": "Graham's law of diffusion states that the rate of diffusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molar mass. To find the diffusion coefficient (D) of a gas, we can use the following equation:\n\nD = (D₀ * M₀) / √M\n\nWhere:\nD₀ = diffusion coefficient of the reference gas (air in this case)\nM₀ = molar mass of the reference gas (air)\nM = molar mass of the given gas\n\nFirst, we need to find the diffusion coefficient of air. For this, we can use the Chapman-Enskog equation:\n\nD₀ = (3.0 × 10⁻²) * T³/² / (P * σ² * Ω)\n\nWhere:\nT = temperature in Kelvin (25°C = 298.15 K)\nP = pressure in atm (assuming 1 atm)\nσ = collision diameter (for air, approximately 3.62 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)\nΩ = collision integral (for air, approximately 1.0)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nD₀ = (3.0 × 10⁻²) * (298.15)³/² / (1 * (3.62 × 10⁻¹⁰)² * 1.0)\n\nD₀ ≈ 2.0 × 10⁻⁵ m²/s\n\nNow, we can find the diffusion coefficient of the given gas. The molar mass of air is approximately 29 g/mol. The molar mass of the given gas is 16 g/mol.\n\nD = (2.0 × 10⁻⁵ * 29) / √16\n\nD ≈ (2.0 × 10⁻⁵ * 29) / 4\n\nD ≈ 1.45 × 10⁻⁵ m²/s\n\nSo, the diffusion coefficient of the gas with a molar mass of 16 g/mol in air at 25°C is approximately 1.45 × 10⁻⁵ m²/s, assuming the gas follows Graham's law."
