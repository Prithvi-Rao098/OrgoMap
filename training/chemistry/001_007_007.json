    "message_2": "The major product formed when toluene reacts with Br2 in the presence of FeBr3 catalyst is ortho-bromotoluene and para-bromotoluene. The reaction mechanism involved is electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n\nHere's the step-by-step reaction mechanism:\n\n1. Activation of the halogen: The FeBr3 catalyst reacts with Br2 to form a highly electrophilic bromine ion (Br+). This is represented by the following equation:\n   FeBr3 + Br2 → FeBr4- + Br+\n\n2. Formation of the sigma complex (arenium ion): The electrophilic bromine ion (Br+) attacks the aromatic ring of toluene, specifically at the ortho and para positions due to the electron-donating effect of the methyl group. This results in the temporary loss of aromaticity and the formation of a sigma complex (arenium ion).\n\n3. Deprotonation and regeneration of aromaticity: A base (usually the bromide ion, Br-) abstracts a proton from the carbon where the bromine ion was added, resulting in the regeneration of the aromatic ring and the formation of the major products, ortho-bromotoluene and para-bromotoluene.\n\n4. Regeneration of the catalyst: The FeBr4- ion releases a Br- ion, regenerating the FeBr3 catalyst.\n\nThe overall reaction can be represented as:\n   Toluene + Br2 → ortho-bromotoluene + para-bromotoluene\n\nThe major products are ortho-bromotoluene and para-bromotoluene due to the directing effect of the methyl group on the benzene ring, which favors electrophilic attack at the ortho and para positions. The para-bromotoluene is usually the major product because it is less sterically hindered than the ortho-bromotoluene."
