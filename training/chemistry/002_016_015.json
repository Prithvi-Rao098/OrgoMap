Also, the standard molar entropy of Fe2O3(s) is 87.4 J/K/mol.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH° = Σ (ΔHf° of products) - Σ (ΔHf° of reactants)\n\nwhere ΔHf° is the standard enthalpy of formation of each substance.\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\n2Fe(s) + 3/2O2(g) → Fe2O3(s)\n\nΔH° = [1 * (-826 kJ/mol)] - [2 * 0 kJ/mol + (3/2) * 0 kJ/mol]\n\nΔH° = -826 kJ/mol\n\nNow, to calculate the standard entropy change (ΔS°) for the reaction, we need the standard molar entropy of Fe(s) and O2(g). Unfortunately, these values are not provided in the problem. However, we can still set up the equation for ΔS°:\n\nΔS° = Σ (S° of products) - Σ (S° of reactants)\n\nwhere S° is the standard molar entropy of each substance.\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\n2Fe(s) + 3/2O2(g) → Fe2O3(s)\n\nΔS° = [1 * 87.4 J/K/mol] - [2 * S°(Fe) + (3/2) * S°(O2)]\n\nWithout the values for S°(Fe) and S°(O2), we cannot calculate ΔS° for the reaction."
