    "message_2": "To calculate the maximum work obtained from a reversible isothermal expansion, we can use the formula:\n\nW = -nRT * ln(Vf / Vi)\n\nwhere W is the work done, n is the number of moles of the gas, R is the ideal gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and Vf and Vi are the final and initial volumes, respectively.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles (n) of the gas. We can use the ideal gas law:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. Rearranging the equation to solve for n:\n\nn = PV / RT\n\nWe are given the initial pressure (Pi = 4.00 atm), initial volume (Vi = 3.00 L), and temperature (25°C). First, we need to convert the temperature to Kelvin:\n\nT = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\n\nNow, we can find the number of moles:\n\nn = (4.00 atm * 3.00 L) / (0.0821 L atm/mol K * 298.15 K)\nn ≈ 0.493 moles\n\nNext, we need to find the final volume (Vf). Since the process is isothermal, we can use Boyle's law:\n\nPi * Vi = Pf * Vf\n\nwhere Pf is the final pressure. We are given the final pressure (Pf = 1.00 atm). Rearranging the equation to solve for Vf:\n\nVf = Pi * Vi / Pf\nVf = (4.00 atm * 3.00 L) / 1.00 atm\nVf = 12.00 L\n\nNow, we can calculate the maximum work obtained from the reversible isothermal expansion:\n\nW = -nRT * ln(Vf / Vi)\nW = -(0.493 moles) * (8.314 J/mol K) * (298.15 K) * ln(12.00 L / 3.00 L)\nW ≈ -5709.4 J\n\nThe maximum amount of work that can be obtained from the reversible isothermal expansion is approximately -5709.4 J. The negative sign indicates that the work is done by the system (the gas) on the surroundings."
