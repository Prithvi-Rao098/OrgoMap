    "message_2": "IF5, or iodine pentafluoride, is a molecule with an iodine atom at the center surrounded by five fluorine atoms. To determine the molecular geometry, we first need to consider the number of electron domains around the central iodine atom.\n\nIodine has 7 valence electrons, and each fluorine atom contributes 1 electron, making a total of 12 electrons. These electrons are arranged in 6 electron domains (5 bonding domains from the 5 F atoms and 1 non-bonding domain from the lone pair of electrons on the iodine atom). \n\nAccording to VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) theory, the electron domains will arrange themselves to minimize repulsion. In the case of IF5, the molecular geometry is square pyramidal. The five fluorine atoms form the base of the pyramid, and the lone pair of electrons occupies the top of the pyramid.\n\nTo determine the polarity of IF5, we need to consider the electronegativity of the atoms involved. Fluorine is highly electronegative, while iodine is less electronegative. This difference in electronegativity creates polar bonds between the iodine and fluorine atoms. Due to the asymmetrical arrangement of the fluorine atoms and the lone pair of electrons in the square pyramidal geometry, these bond dipoles do not cancel each other out, resulting in a net molecular dipole moment. Therefore, IF5 is a polar molecule."
