    "message_2": "The presence of a catalyst affects the rate constant of a reaction with a specific mechanism by providing an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy. This results in an increase in the rate constant and subsequently, the reaction rate.\n\nA catalyst works by forming temporary bonds with the reactants, stabilizing the transition state, and lowering the activation energy required for the reaction to proceed. This allows more reactant molecules to have enough energy to overcome the activation energy barrier, leading to an increase in the rate constant.\n\nIt is important to note that a catalyst does not change the equilibrium constant or the overall energy change of the reaction. It only affects the rate at which the reaction reaches equilibrium. Once the reaction is complete, the catalyst is released unchanged and can be used again for the same reaction."
