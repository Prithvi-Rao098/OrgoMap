    "message_2": "The coordination compound [Co(en)2Cl2]+ has two possible structural isomers. These isomers are geometrical isomers, specifically cis and trans isomers, which differ in the spatial arrangement of the ligands around the central cobalt atom.\n\nIn the cis isomer, the two chloride ligands are adjacent to each other, while in the trans isomer, the chloride ligands are opposite to each other. The ethylenediamine (en) ligands are bidentate, meaning they occupy two coordination sites, and they cannot change their positions relative to each other. Therefore, there are only two possible structural isomers for this coordination compound."
