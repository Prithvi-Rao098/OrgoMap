    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the Nernst equation and the standard reduction potentials of the half-reactions involved. The Nernst equation is:\n\nE = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\n\nwhere E is the cell potential, E° is the standard cell potential, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin (assuming 298 K, which is 25°C), n is the number of electrons transferred, F is the Faraday constant (96485 C/mol), and Q is the reaction quotient.\n\nFirst, let's find the standard cell potential (E°) using the standard reduction potentials of the half-reactions:\n\nCu2+(aq) + 2e- → Cu(s)  E° = +0.34 V (reduction)\nAg+(aq) + e- → Ag(s)    E° = +0.80 V (reduction)\n\nSince we need the oxidation half-reaction for Cu(s), we reverse the first half-reaction:\n\nCu(s) → Cu2+(aq) + 2e-  E° = -0.34 V (oxidation)\n\nNow, we can find the standard cell potential (E°) for the overall reaction:\n\nE°(cell) = E°(reduction) + E°(oxidation) = 0.80 V + (-0.34 V) = 0.46 V\n\nNext, we need to find the reaction quotient (Q) using the given concentrations:\n\nQ = [Cu2+]/[Ag+]^2 = (0.1 M)/(0.05 M)^2 = 0.1/0.0025 = 40\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Nernst equation to find the cell potential (E):\n\nE = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\nE = 0.46 V - ((8.314 J/mol·K) * (298 K) / (2 * 96485 C/mol)) * ln(40)\nE ≈ 0.46 V - (0.0129 V) * ln(40)\nE ≈ 0.46 V - 0.0129 V * 3.6889\nE ≈ 0.46 V - 0.0476 V\nE ≈ 0.4124 V\n\nThe electromotive force (EMF) of the electrochemical cell when the concentration of Ag+ ions is 0.05 M and Cu2+ ions is 0.1 M is approximately 0.4124 V."
