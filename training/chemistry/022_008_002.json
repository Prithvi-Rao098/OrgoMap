    "message_1": "Sure. Here is a question for the chemistry student to solve regarding Single Replacement Reactions:\n\nIf a piece of zinc is placed in a solution containing copper ions, what will be the products of the reaction? Write the balanced chemical equation of the reaction and identify the type of single replacement reaction that occurred.",
    "message_2": "When a piece of zinc is placed in a solution containing copper ions, a single replacement reaction occurs. Zinc, being more reactive than copper, displaces the copper ions from the solution, forming zinc ions and solid copper. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nZn (s) + Cu²⁺ (aq) → Zn²⁺ (aq) + Cu (s)\n\nIn this reaction, zinc undergoes oxidation (loses electrons) and copper undergoes reduction (gains electrons). This type of single replacement reaction is also known as a redox (reduction-oxidation) reaction."
