    "message_2": "Carbon monoxide (CO) is a diatomic molecule consisting of one carbon (C) atom and one oxygen (O) atom. To determine the electronic configuration and molecular orbital diagram, we first need to know the individual atomic electronic configurations of carbon and oxygen.\n\nCarbon (C) has 6 electrons: 1s² 2s² 2p²\nOxygen (O) has 8 electrons: 1s² 2s² 2p⁴\n\nNow, we can construct the molecular orbital diagram for CO. The molecular orbitals are formed by the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) from both carbon and oxygen. The atomic orbitals combine to form bonding (lower energy) and antibonding (higher energy) molecular orbitals.\n\nMolecular orbitals for CO:\n1. σ(1s) - bonding\n2. σ*(1s) - antibonding\n3. σ(2s) - bonding\n4. σ*(2s) - antibonding\n5. σ(2pz) - bonding\n6. π(2px) and π(2py) - bonding (degenerate orbitals)\n7. π*(2px) and π*(2py) - antibonding (degenerate orbitals)\n8. σ*(2pz) - antibonding\n\nNow, we fill the molecular orbitals with the 14 electrons from carbon and oxygen (6 from C and 8 from O):\n\n1. σ(1s) - 2 electrons\n2. σ*(1s) - 2 electrons\n3. σ(2s) - 2 electrons\n4. σ*(2s) - 2 electrons\n5. σ(2pz) - 2 electrons\n6. π(2px) and π(2py) - 4 electrons (2 in each)\n7. π*(2px) and π*(2py) - 0 electrons\n8. σ*(2pz) - 0 electrons\n\nThe electronic configuration for CO is:\nσ(1s)² σ*(1s)² σ(2s)² σ*(2s)² σ(2pz)² π(2px)² π(2py)²\n\nThe molecular orbital diagram for CO would show the energy levels of the molecular orbitals listed above, with the bonding orbitals at lower energy levels and antibonding orbitals at higher energy levels. The diagram would also show the 14 electrons filling the orbitals in the order described above."
