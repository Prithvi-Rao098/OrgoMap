    "message_2": "First, we need to find the number of moles of silver deposited. The molar mass of silver (Ag) is 107.87 g/mol.\n\nmoles of Ag = mass of Ag / molar mass of Ag\nmoles of Ag = 0.15 g / 107.87 g/mol = 0.00139 mol\n\nNext, we need to find the total charge passed during the electrolysis. The charge (Q) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nQ = current (I) × time (t)\nQ = 0.5 A × 150 s = 75 Coulombs\n\nNow, we can find the number of electrons transferred during the electrolysis. Silver has a valency of 1, so one mole of electrons is required to deposit one mole of silver. Therefore, the number of moles of electrons transferred is equal to the number of moles of silver deposited.\n\nmoles of electrons = moles of Ag = 0.00139 mol\n\nFinally, we can calculate the Faraday constant (F) using the formula:\n\nF = charge (Q) / moles of electrons\nF = 75 C / 0.00139 mol = 53985.61 C/mol\n\nThe Faraday constant is approximately 53985.61 C/mol."
