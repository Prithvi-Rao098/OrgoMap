    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of precipitation, we first need to determine the balanced chemical equation for the reaction and the enthalpy change for the reaction (ΔH). The balanced chemical equation for the reaction between barium chloride (BaCl2) and sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) is:\n\nBaCl2(aq) + Na2SO4(aq) → BaSO4(s) + 2NaCl(aq)\n\nNext, we need to determine the limiting reactant. To do this, we can compare the moles of each reactant:\n\nMoles of BaCl2 = (volume × concentration) = (50.0 mL × 0.200 M) = 10.0 mmol\nMoles of Na2SO4 = (volume × concentration) = (30.0 mL × 0.150 M) = 4.50 mmol\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, we can see that Na2SO4 is the limiting reactant. Therefore, the reaction will produce 4.50 mmol of BaSO4.\n\nNow we need to find the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the reaction. We can use the standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) values for each compound in the reaction:\n\nΔHf (BaCl2, aq) = -858 kJ/mol\nΔHf (Na2SO4, aq) = -1381 kJ/mol\nΔHf (BaSO4, s) = -1435 kJ/mol\nΔHf (NaCl, aq) = -407 kJ/mol\n\nUsing Hess's Law, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nΔH = [ΔHf (BaSO4, s) + 2ΔHf (NaCl, aq)] - [ΔHf (BaCl2, aq) + ΔHf (Na2SO4, aq)]\nΔH = [(-1435 kJ/mol) + 2(-407 kJ/mol)] - [(-858 kJ/mol) + (-1381 kJ/mol)]\nΔH = (-1435 - 814) - (-858 - 1381)\nΔH = -2249 + 2239\nΔH = -10 kJ/mol\n\nNow we can calculate the enthalpy of precipitation for the reaction:\n\nEnthalpy of precipitation = ΔH × moles of limiting reactant\nEnthalpy of precipitation = (-10 kJ/mol) × (4.50 mmol)\nEnthalpy of precipitation = -45 kJ\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy of precipitation for this reaction is -45 kJ."
