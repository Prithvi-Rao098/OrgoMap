    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of one mole of methane gas, we need to use the balanced chemical equation and the standard enthalpies of formation for each compound involved.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane is:\n\nCH₄(g) + 2O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nNow, we need the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) for each compound:\n\nΔHf°(CH₄) = -74.8 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(O₂) = 0 kJ/mol (since O₂ is an element in its standard state)\nΔHf°(CO₂) = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(H₂O) = -241.8 kJ/mol\n\nUsing Hess's Law, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction (ΔHrxn) as follows:\n\nΔHrxn = [ΔHf°(CO₂) + 2ΔHf°(H₂O)] - [ΔHf°(CH₄) + 2ΔHf°(O₂)]\n\nΔHrxn = [(-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2(-241.8 kJ/mol)] - [(-74.8 kJ/mol) + 2(0 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔHrxn = (-393.5 - 483.6 + 74.8) kJ/mol\n\nΔHrxn = -802.3 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the enthalpy change for the combustion of one mole of methane gas to form carbon dioxide gas and water vapor at standard temperature and pressure (STP) is -802.3 kJ/mol."
