    "message_2": "Benzene (C6H6) is an aromatic hydrocarbon with a planar hexagonal ring structure. It has two resonance structures that contribute to its overall stability. In both resonance structures, each carbon atom is bonded to two other carbon atoms and one hydrogen atom, with no formal charges on any of the atoms. The difference between the two resonance structures lies in the placement of the pi-bonds.\n\nResonance Structure 1:\n- Pi-bonds are located between carbon atoms 1-2, 3-4, and 5-6.\n\nResonance Structure 2:\n- Pi-bonds are located between carbon atoms 2-3, 4-5, and 6-1.\n\nThese two resonance structures are equivalent and contribute equally to the overall structure of benzene. The true structure of benzene is a hybrid of these two resonance structures, with the pi-bonds being delocalized over all six carbon atoms, creating a ring of electron density above and below the plane of the carbon atoms. This delocalization of electrons contributes to the stability and unique properties of benzene."
