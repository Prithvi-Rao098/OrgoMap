    "message_2": "To determine the mass percentage composition of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen in a compound found in a soil sample using elemental analysis, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Obtain the empirical formula of the compound from the elemental analysis data. This will give you the ratio of the elements in the compound.\n\n2. Calculate the molar mass of the empirical formula. To do this, multiply the atomic mass of each element by the number of atoms of that element in the empirical formula and add the results together.\n\n3. Calculate the mass percentage of each element in the compound. Divide the mass of each element in the empirical formula by the molar mass of the compound and multiply by 100.\n\nHere's an example:\n\nSuppose the elemental analysis data shows that the compound contains 40% carbon (C), 6.7% hydrogen (H), and 53.3% nitrogen (N) by mass.\n\n1. Convert the mass percentages to moles by dividing by the atomic mass of each element:\n\nMoles of C = 40 g / 12.01 g/mol = 3.33 mol\nMoles of H = 6.7 g / 1.01 g/mol = 6.63 mol\nMoles of N = 53.3 g / 14.01 g/mol = 3.80 mol\n\n2. Determine the empirical formula by dividing the moles of each element by the smallest number of moles:\n\nC: 3.33 / 3.33 = 1\nH: 6.63 / 3.33 = 1.99 ≈ 2\nN: 3.80 / 3.33 = 1.14 ≈ 1\n\nSo the empirical formula is CH2N.\n\n3. Calculate the molar mass of the empirical formula:\n\nMolar mass = (1 × 12.01 g/mol) + (2 × 1.01 g/mol) + (1 × 14.01 g/mol) = 28.04 g/mol\n\n4. Calculate the mass percentage of each element in the compound:\n\nMass % of C = (12.01 g/mol / 28.04 g/mol) × 100 = 42.84%\nMass % of H = (2 × 1.01 g/mol / 28.04 g/mol) × 100 = 7.20%\nMass % of N = (14.01 g/mol / 28.04 g/mol) × 100 = 49.96%\n\nSo the mass percentage composition of the compound is approximately 42.84% carbon, 7.20% hydrogen, and 49.96% nitrogen."
