    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of a substance, we can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat energy, m is the mass of the substance, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nm = 50 g (mass of water)\nc = 4.18 J/g°C (specific heat capacity of water)\nΔT = 100°C - 25°C = 75°C (change in temperature)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nq = (50 g) × (4.18 J/g°C) × (75°C)\n\nq = 50 × 4.18 × 75\n\nq = 15725 J\n\nSo, the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 50 g of water from 25°C to 100°C is 15,725 Joules."
