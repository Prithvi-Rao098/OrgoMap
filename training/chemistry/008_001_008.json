    "message_2": "When sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) react with rainwater, they form acid rain. The chemical reactions can be represented as follows:\n\n1. Sulfur dioxide reacts with water (H2O) to form sulfurous acid (H2SO3):\nSO2 + H2O → H2SO3\n\n2. Sulfurous acid can further oxidize to form sulfuric acid (H2SO4):\n2H2SO3 + O2 → 2H2SO4\n\n3. Nitrogen oxides, such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and nitric oxide (NO), react with water to form nitric acid (HNO3):\n2NO2 + H2O → HNO3 + HNO2\n3NO2 + H2O → 2HNO3 + NO\n\nAcid rain, which contains these acids (H2SO4, H2SO3, HNO3, and HNO2), contributes to the degradation of building facades through a process called chemical weathering. When acid rain comes into contact with building materials, such as limestone (CaCO3) or marble (also composed of CaCO3), the acids react with the calcium carbonate to form soluble salts that can be washed away. This reaction can be represented as:\n\nCaCO3 + H2SO4 → CaSO4 + H2O + CO2\nCaCO3 + 2HNO3 → Ca(NO3)2 + H2O + CO2\n\nThe dissolution of calcium carbonate weakens the building facade, leading to the loss of structural integrity and aesthetic value. Additionally, acid rain can also react with other minerals and metals in building materials, causing further damage and corrosion."
