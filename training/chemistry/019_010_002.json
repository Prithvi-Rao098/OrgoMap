    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of ethane, we can use the following formula:\n\nΔH_combustion = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH_combustion is the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of ethane, ΔH_f(products) is the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of the products, and ΔH_f(reactants) is the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of the reactants.\n\nFirst, let's find the standard enthalpy of formation for the reactants and products:\n\nReactants:\n- C2H6 (g): The standard enthalpy of combustion of ethane is given as -1560 kJ/mol. Since the combustion of ethane involves the formation of 2 moles of CO2 and 3 moles of H2O, we can use this information to find the standard enthalpy of formation of ethane.\n- O2 (g): The standard enthalpy of formation of an element in its standard state is 0 kJ/mol.\n\nProducts:\n- CO2 (g): The standard enthalpy of formation is given as -393.5 kJ/mol.\n- H2O (l): The standard enthalpy of formation is given as -285.8 kJ/mol.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nΔH_combustion = [(2 × -393.5) + (3 × -285.8)] - [(-1560) + (0)]\n\nΔH_combustion = (-787) + (-857.4) - (-1560)\n\nΔH_combustion = -1644.4 + 1560\n\nΔH_combustion = -84.4 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the combustion of ethane (C2H6) is -84.4 kJ/mol."
