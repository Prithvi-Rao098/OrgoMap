    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔGº) for the reaction, we first need to find the change in enthalpy (ΔHº) and the change in entropy (ΔSº) for the reaction. \n\n1. Calculate ΔHº for the reaction:\nΔHº = Σ ΔHºf(products) - Σ ΔHºf(reactants)\n\nFor the products, we have 2 moles of H2O(l), so:\nΔHº(products) = 2 * (-285.8 kJ/mol) = -571.6 kJ\n\nFor the reactants, we have 2 moles of H2(g) and 1 mole of O2(g), both with ΔHºf = 0 kJ/mol, so:\nΔHº(reactants) = 2 * 0 kJ/mol + 1 * 0 kJ/mol = 0 kJ\n\nNow, we can find ΔHº for the reaction:\nΔHº = -571.6 kJ - 0 kJ = -571.6 kJ\n\n2. Calculate ΔSº for the reaction:\nWe are given ΔSº[H2O(l)] = -69.9 J/K·mol. However, we need the entropy change for the entire reaction. Since we don't have the entropy values for H2(g) and O2(g), we cannot directly calculate ΔSº for the reaction.\n\n3. Calculate ΔGº for the reaction:\nSince we don't have the entropy change for the reaction, we cannot use the equation ΔGº = ΔHº - TΔSº directly. However, we know that the reaction of hydrogen and oxygen to form water is spontaneous under standard conditions, which means ΔGº must be negative. Therefore, the Gibbs free energy change for the reaction is negative, but we cannot determine the exact value without the entropy change for the reaction."
