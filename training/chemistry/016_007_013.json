    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy of formation for methane (CH4), we can use the following combustion reaction:\n\nCH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l)\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for this reaction (ΔH°) can be calculated using the standard enthalpies of formation for the products and reactants:\n\nΔH° = Σ [standard enthalpies of formation of products] - Σ [standard enthalpies of formation of reactants]\n\nFor this reaction, the standard enthalpy change is:\n\nΔH° = [1 * (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 * (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [1 * ΔHf°(CH4) + 2 * 0]\n\nNote that the standard enthalpy of formation for O2 is 0 because it is in its standard state.\n\nΔH° = (-393.5 - 2 * 285.8) - ΔHf°(CH4)\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the combustion of methane (ΔH°) is approximately -890.3 kJ/mol. Therefore:\n\n-890.3 kJ/mol = (-393.5 - 2 * 285.8) - ΔHf°(CH4)\n\nSolving for ΔHf°(CH4):\n\nΔHf°(CH4) = -74.8 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy of formation for methane (CH4) at a temperature of 298 K is approximately -74.8 kJ/mol."
