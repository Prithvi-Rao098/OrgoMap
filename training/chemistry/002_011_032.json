    "message_2": "The geometry of the XeF4 (xenon hexafluoride) molecule is square planar. This is because xenon has six valence electrons, and it forms four bonds with four fluorine atoms, leaving two lone pairs on the central xenon atom. According to the VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) theory, these six electron groups (four bonding pairs and two lone pairs) arrange themselves in an octahedral electron-pair geometry. However, since the lone pairs are not visible in the molecular geometry, we see a square planar shape for the XeF4 molecule.\n\nRegarding polarity, the XeF4 molecule is nonpolar. Although the Xe-F bonds are polar due to the difference in electronegativity between xenon and fluorine atoms, the overall molecular geometry causes these bond dipoles to cancel each other out. In a square planar arrangement, the bond dipoles are symmetrically distributed, and their vector sum is zero, resulting in a nonpolar molecule."
