    "message_2": "To design a system for the safe storage and transportation of 1000 liters of hydrochloric acid, the following factors should be considered:\n\n1. Storage container: The storage container should be made of materials that are resistant to corrosion by hydrochloric acid, such as high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP), or polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The container should have a capacity of at least 1100 liters to allow for any expansion of the acid due to temperature changes. It should also be equipped with a venting system to release any pressure build-up.\n\n2. Temperature and pressure control: Hydrochloric acid should be stored at a temperature between 10°C and 30°C to minimize the risk of pressure build-up and to maintain the integrity of the storage container. The storage area should be well-ventilated and equipped with temperature and pressure monitoring devices.\n\n3. Transportation vehicle: The transportation vehicle should have a dedicated, well-ventilated, and secure compartment for the storage container. The vehicle should be equipped with a spill containment system, such as a spill pallet or tray, to contain any leaks or spills during transportation.\n\n4. Handling equipment: Proper handling equipment, such as drum lifters, pallet jacks, or forklifts, should be used to move the storage container. All equipment should be compatible with the corrosive nature of hydrochloric acid.\n\n5. Safety measures: All personnel involved in the storage and transportation of hydrochloric acid should be trained in proper handling techniques and should wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), such as chemical-resistant gloves, goggles, and aprons.\n\n6. Emergency response measures: In case of spills or leaks, an emergency response plan should be in place. This plan should include the following:\n\n   a. Immediate containment of the spill or leak using absorbent materials or neutralizing agents, such as sodium bicarbonate.\n   \n   b. Notification of appropriate authorities, such as local fire departments or hazardous materials response teams.\n   \n   c. Proper disposal of contaminated materials in accordance with local regulations.\n\n7. Documentation and labeling: The storage container and transportation vehicle should be clearly labeled with the appropriate hazard symbols and information about the contents, including the chemical name, concentration, and hazard warnings. All necessary documentation, such as safety data sheets (SDS) and transportation permits, should be readily available.\n\nBy taking these factors into account, a safe and effective system for the storage and transportation of 1000 liters of hydrochloric acid can be designed, minimizing the risk of accidents and ensuring the safety of personnel and the environment."
