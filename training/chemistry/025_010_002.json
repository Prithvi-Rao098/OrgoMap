    "message_2": "To increase access to current research in chemistry for undergraduate students with limited exposure, several strategies can be employed:\n\n1. Collaborate with universities and institutions: Establish partnerships with universities and research institutions to provide students with access to their research databases and libraries. This will enable students to access the latest research articles, journals, and other resources.\n\n2. Open access journals: Encourage the use of open access journals, which provide free access to research articles. Promote the use of reputable open access platforms like the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) and Public Library of Science (PLOS) among students.\n\n3. Online resources: Introduce students to various online resources, such as the National Science Digital Library (NSDL), the Royal Society of Chemistry's ChemSpider, and the American Chemical Society's (ACS) ChemWorx, which provide access to a wealth of chemistry-related information and research.\n\n4. Workshops and seminars: Organize workshops and seminars on current research topics in chemistry, inviting researchers and experts to share their knowledge with students. This will not only expose students to the latest research but also help them network with professionals in the field.\n\n5. Research internships: Encourage students to participate in research internships at universities, research institutions, or companies. This hands-on experience will provide them with a better understanding of current research and its applications.\n\n6. Research clubs and societies: Establish research clubs or societies within the educational institution, where students can discuss current research topics, share resources, and collaborate on projects.\n\n7. Faculty involvement: Encourage faculty members to share their research with students and involve them in ongoing projects. This will provide students with first-hand experience in conducting research and understanding the latest developments in the field.\n\n8. Grants and scholarships: Seek funding opportunities, such as grants and scholarships, to support students in accessing research resources or attending conferences and workshops.\n\n9. Social media and online forums: Utilize social media platforms and online forums to share and discuss current research in chemistry. This will help students stay updated on the latest developments and engage with the global chemistry community.\n\n10. Mentorship programs: Establish mentorship programs where experienced researchers and professionals can guide and support undergraduate students in their pursuit of understanding and participating in current research. This will help students develop essential skills and knowledge required for a successful career in chemistry."
