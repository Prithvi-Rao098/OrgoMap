    "message_1": "What is the maximum electrical work that can be obtained from a Galvanic cell made up of a Zn electrode in 1.0 M ZnSO4 solution and a Cu electrode in 1.0 M CuSO4 solution, at 25°C when the cell has a potential difference of 1.10 V? The standard electrode potentials for Zn and Cu electrodes are -0.76 V and +0.34 V, respectively.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the maximum electrical work that can be obtained from the Galvanic cell, we need to determine the cell potential and the number of moles of electrons transferred in the redox reaction.\n\nFirst, let's write the half-reactions for the Zn and Cu electrodes:\n\nZn → Zn²⁺ + 2e⁻ (oxidation)\nCu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu (reduction)\n\nThe overall cell reaction is:\nZn + Cu²⁺ → Zn²⁺ + Cu\n\nNow, let's calculate the cell potential (E_cell) using the standard electrode potentials:\n\nE_cell = E_red (Cu) - E_ox (Zn)\nE_cell = (+0.34 V) - (-0.76 V)\nE_cell = 1.10 V\n\nSince the cell potential is given as 1.10 V, the cell is operating under standard conditions.\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of moles of electrons (n) transferred in the redox reaction. In this case, 2 moles of electrons are transferred per mole of Zn and Cu reacting.\n\nNow, we can calculate the maximum electrical work (W) using the formula:\n\nW = -n * F * E_cell\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of electrons transferred, F is Faraday's constant (96,485 C/mol), and E_cell is the cell potential.\n\nW = -2 * 96,485 C/mol * 1.10 V\nW = -212,267 J/mol\n\nThe maximum electrical work that can be obtained from the Galvanic cell is -212,267 J/mol. The negative sign indicates that the work is done by the system (the Galvanic cell) on the surroundings."
