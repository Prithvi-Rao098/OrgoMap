    "message_1": "What is the purity of a solid sample of aspirin, and does it meet the purity requirements for use in medicines, if it has a melting point range between 134-136°C?",
    "message_2": "The purity of a solid sample can be assessed by comparing its melting point range to the known melting point of the pure substance. The melting point of pure aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) is approximately 138-140°C. A narrow melting point range indicates a relatively pure substance, while a wider range suggests impurities.\n\nIn this case, the solid sample of aspirin has a melting point range of 134-136°C, which is slightly lower than the pure aspirin melting point range. This suggests that the sample may contain some impurities. However, without further information, it is difficult to determine the exact purity percentage.\n\nPharmaceutical-grade aspirin must meet strict purity requirements to be used in medicines. The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) sets the standards for drug purity, and for aspirin, it requires a minimum purity of 99.0%. Since the melting point range of the sample is lower than the pure aspirin, it is possible that the sample does not meet the 99.0% purity requirement for use in medicines.\n\nTo confirm the purity of the aspirin sample and determine if it meets the pharmaceutical requirements, additional tests such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or gas chromatography (GC) should be performed. These tests can provide a more accurate assessment of the sample's purity."
