    "message_2": "To determine the rate law, we need to analyze how the initial rate changes with respect to the concentrations of H2O2 and KI.\n\nFirst, let's compare experiments 1 and 2 from Experiment 1:\n\nWhen [H2O2] doubles (from 0.1 M to 0.2 M) and [KI] remains constant (0.1 M), the initial rate doubles (from 8.0 x 10^-5 M/s to 1.6 x 10^-4 M/s). This suggests that the reaction is first order with respect to H2O2.\n\nNow, let's compare experiments 1 and 3 from Experiment 1:\n\nWhen [H2O2] remains constant (0.1 M) and [KI] doubles (from 0.1 M to 0.2 M), the initial rate also doubles (from 8.0 x 10^-5 M/s to 1.6 x 10^-4 M/s). This suggests that the reaction is first order with respect to KI.\n\nSince the reaction is first order with respect to both H2O2 and KI, the overall rate law can be written as:\n\nRate = k[H2O2]^1[KI]^1\n\nor\n\nRate = k[H2O2][KI]\n\nwhere k is the rate constant."
