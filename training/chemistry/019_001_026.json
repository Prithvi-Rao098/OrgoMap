    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH_reaction = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nIn this case, the reactants are H2(g) and O2(g), and the product is H2O(l). The enthalpy change of formation for H2(g) and O2(g) is 0 kJ/mol, as they are in their standard states. The enthalpy change of formation for H2O(l) is given as -285.8 kJ/mol.\n\nThe balanced equation is:\n\n2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(l)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the equation:\n\nΔH_reaction = [2 × (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [2 × 0 kJ/mol + 0 kJ/mol]\n\nΔH_reaction = (-571.6 kJ/mol) - 0\n\nΔH_reaction = -571.6 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change for the reaction is -571.6 kJ/mol."
