    "message_2": "The balanced chemical equation for the preparation of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene from nitrobenzene and chlorine gas is:\n\nC6H5NO2 + 2 Cl2 → C6H3Cl2NO2 + 2 HCl\n\nTo determine the amount of each reagent required to produce 10 grams of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene, we will use stoichiometry.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the molar mass of each compound:\n\n- Nitrobenzene (C6H5NO2): (6 × 12.01) + (5 × 1.01) + (14.01) + (2 × 16.00) = 123.11 g/mol\n- 2,4-Dichloronitrobenzene (C6H3Cl2NO2): (6 × 12.01) + (3 × 1.01) + (2 × 35.45) + (14.01) + (2 × 16.00) = 176.02 g/mol\n- Chlorine gas (Cl2): 2 × 35.45 = 70.90 g/mol\n\nNow, we will calculate the moles of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene required:\n\n10 g / 176.02 g/mol = 0.0568 mol\n\nFrom the balanced chemical equation, we can see that 1 mole of nitrobenzene reacts with 2 moles of chlorine gas to produce 1 mole of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene. Therefore, we need 0.0568 moles of nitrobenzene and 0.1136 moles of chlorine gas.\n\nFinally, we will convert the moles of each reagent to grams:\n\n- Nitrobenzene: 0.0568 mol × 123.11 g/mol = 6.99 g\n- Chlorine gas: 0.1136 mol × 70.90 g/mol = 8.06 g\n\nSo, to produce 10 grams of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene, you will need 6.99 grams of nitrobenzene and 8.06 grams of chlorine gas."
