Assume the densities of ethanol and water to be 0.789 g/mL and 1 g/mL, respectively, and the specific heat of the mixture to be 4.184 J/g°C.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the number of moles of ethanol and water in the mixture.\n\nThe molar mass of ethanol (C2H5OH) is approximately 46.07 g/mol.\n\nMoles of ethanol = mass / molar mass\nMoles of ethanol = 25 g / 46.07 g/mol = 0.542 moles\n\nThe molar mass of water (H2O) is approximately 18.015 g/mol.\n\nMoles of water = mass / molar mass\nMoles of water = 75 g / 18.015 g/mol = 4.164 moles\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat of mixing for the ethanol and water.\n\nHeat of mixing = moles of ethanol * heat of mixing per mole\nHeat of mixing = 0.542 moles * -4.4 kJ/mol = -2.3848 kJ\n\nSince the heat of mixing is negative, it means that the process is exothermic and heat is released during the mixing of ethanol and water.\n\nNow, let's calculate the temperature change of the mixture due to the heat of mixing.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total mass of the mixture.\n\nTotal mass = mass of ethanol + mass of water\nTotal mass = 25 g + 75 g = 100 g\n\nNext, we need to convert the heat of mixing from kJ to J.\n\nHeat of mixing = -2.3848 kJ * 1000 J/kJ = -2384.8 J\n\nNow, we can use the specific heat formula to find the temperature change.\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nWhere q is the heat, m is the mass, c is the specific heat, and ΔT is the temperature change.\n\nΔT = q / (mc)\nΔT = -2384.8 J / (100 g * 4.184 J/g°C)\nΔT = -2384.8 J / 418.4 J/°C\nΔT = -5.7°C\n\nSince the initial temperature was 25°C, the final temperature of the mixture will be:\n\nFinal temperature = initial temperature + ΔT\nFinal temperature = 25°C - 5.7°C = 19.3°C\n\nSo, the heat of mixing when 25 grams of ethanol is added to 75 grams of water at 25°C is -2.3848 kJ, and the final temperature of the mixture is 19.3°C."
