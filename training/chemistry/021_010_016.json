    "message_2": "To determine the bond enthalpy of a carbon-carbon single bond in ethane (C2H6) using experimental data, we can use the enthalpy of formation of ethane and the enthalpy of formation of its constituent elements in their standard states.\n\nThe enthalpy of formation of ethane, ΔHf°(C2H6), is -84.68 kJ/mol. The enthalpy of formation of carbon in its standard state (graphite) is 0 kJ/mol, and the enthalpy of formation of hydrogen gas (H2) is also 0 kJ/mol.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the formation of ethane is:\n\n2C (graphite) + 3H2 (g) → C2H6 (g)\n\nUsing Hess's Law, we can calculate the bond enthalpy of the carbon-carbon single bond in ethane:\n\nΔHrxn = Σ [ΔHf°(products)] - Σ [ΔHf°(reactants)]\n\nΔHrxn = ΔHf°(C2H6) - [2 * ΔHf°(C) + 3 * ΔHf°(H2)]\n\nΔHrxn = -84.68 kJ/mol - [2 * 0 + 3 * 0]\n\nΔHrxn = -84.68 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we need to account for the enthalpy of the six C-H bonds in ethane. The average bond enthalpy of a C-H bond is approximately 413 kJ/mol. Since there are six C-H bonds in ethane, the total enthalpy of the C-H bonds is:\n\nΔH(C-H) = 6 * 413 kJ/mol = 2478 kJ/mol\n\nTo find the bond enthalpy of the carbon-carbon single bond, we can subtract the enthalpy of the C-H bonds from the enthalpy of the reaction:\n\nΔH(C-C) = ΔHrxn - ΔH(C-H)\n\nΔH(C-C) = -84.68 kJ/mol - (-2478 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH(C-C) ≈ 2393 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the bond enthalpy of a carbon-carbon single bond in ethane (C2H6) using experimental data is approximately 2393 kJ/mol."
