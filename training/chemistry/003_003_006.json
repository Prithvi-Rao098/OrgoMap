    "message_2": "To determine the rate law expression and rate constant for the reaction, we need to analyze the experimental data provided. The rate law expression has the general form:\n\nrate = k [H2O2]^m [I-]^n\n\nwhere k is the rate constant, m and n are the reaction orders with respect to H2O2 and I-, respectively.\n\nFirst, let's find the reaction order with respect to H2O2. Compare experiments 1 and 3, where the concentration of I- is constant:\n\n(4.80 x 10^-4) / (1.20 x 10^-4) = (0.04 / 0.02)^m\n4 = 2^m\nm = 2\n\nSo, the reaction is second order with respect to H2O2.\n\nNext, let's find the reaction order with respect to I-. Compare experiments 1 and 2, where the concentration of H2O2 is constant:\n\n(2.40 x 10^-4) / (1.20 x 10^-4) = (0.04 / 0.02)^n\n2 = 2^n\nn = 1\n\nSo, the reaction is first order with respect to I-.\n\nNow, we can write the rate law expression:\n\nrate = k [H2O2]^2 [I-]^1\n\nTo find the rate constant k, we can use the data from any of the experiments. Let's use experiment 1:\n\n1.20 x 10^-4 = k (0.02)^2 (0.02)\n1.20 x 10^-4 = k (4 x 10^-6)\nk = (1.20 x 10^-4) / (4 x 10^-6)\nk = 30 M^-2 s^-1\n\nSo, the rate law expression for this reaction is:\n\nrate = 30 [H2O2]^2 [I-]"
