    "message_2": "To calculate the heat of hydration of MgSO4·7H2O, we can use the following equation:\n\nHeat of hydration = Enthalpy change for dissolving MgSO4 + Enthalpy change for hydrating MgSO4·7H2O\n\nGiven:\nEnthalpy change for dissolving 1 mol of MgSO4 in water = -26.83 kJ/mol\nEnthalpy change for hydrating 1 mol of MgSO4·7H2O with 7 moles of water = -233.80 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nHeat of hydration = (-26.83 kJ/mol) + (-233.80 kJ/mol)\nHeat of hydration = -260.63 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the heat of hydration of MgSO4·7H2O is -260.63 kJ/mol."
