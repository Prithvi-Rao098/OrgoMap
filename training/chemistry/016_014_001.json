(Given: the heat capacities for solid and gaseous iodine are 0.214 J/g °C and 0.0909 J/g °C, respectively; the enthalpy of fusion for iodine is 15.52 kJ/mol; the molar mass of iodine is 126.90 g/mol).",
    "message_2": "To find the heat of sublimation of iodine, we need to calculate the total heat absorbed during the process. The process involves three steps:\n\n1. Heating the solid iodine from -20°C to its melting point (113.5°C)\n2. Melting the solid iodine into liquid iodine\n3. Heating the gaseous iodine from 113.5°C to 115°C\n\nStep 1: Heating the solid iodine\nq1 = mass x heat capacity (solid) x ΔT\nq1 = 50.0 g x 0.214 J/g°C x (113.5°C - (-20°C))\nq1 = 50.0 g x 0.214 J/g°C x 133.5°C\nq1 = 1424.55 J\n\nStep 2: Melting the solid iodine\nFirst, we need to find the moles of iodine:\nmoles = mass / molar mass\nmoles = 50.0 g / 126.90 g/mol\nmoles = 0.394 mol\n\nNow, we can find the heat absorbed during melting:\nq2 = moles x enthalpy of fusion\nq2 = 0.394 mol x 15.52 kJ/mol\nq2 = 6.116 kJ\nq2 = 6116 J (converted to Joules)\n\nStep 3: Heating the gaseous iodine\nq3 = mass x heat capacity (gas) x ΔT\nq3 = 50.0 g x 0.0909 J/g°C x (115°C - 113.5°C)\nq3 = 50.0 g x 0.0909 J/g°C x 1.5°C\nq3 = 6.8175 J\n\nNow, we can find the total heat absorbed (q_total) by adding the heat absorbed in each step:\nq_total = q1 + q2 + q3\nq_total = 1424.55 J + 6116 J + 6.8175 J\nq_total = 7547.3675 J\n\nFinally, we can find the heat of sublimation per mole of iodine:\nHeat of sublimation = q_total / moles\nHeat of sublimation = 7547.3675 J / 0.394 mol\nHeat of sublimation ≈ 19160 J/mol or 19.16 kJ/mol"
