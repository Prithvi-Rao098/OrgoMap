    "message_2": "The difference in boiling points of molecules with similar molecular masses, such as methane (CH4) and ammonia (NH3), can be attributed to the differences in the types and strengths of intermolecular forces (IMFs) present in these substances.\n\nMethane (CH4) is a nonpolar molecule, which means that the electrons are distributed evenly, and there is no net dipole moment. The primary intermolecular force present in methane is London dispersion forces, also known as van der Waals forces. These forces are relatively weak and arise due to temporary fluctuations in electron distribution, leading to instantaneous dipoles that attract other molecules.\n\nOn the other hand, ammonia (NH3) is a polar molecule, as the nitrogen atom has a higher electronegativity than the hydrogen atoms, resulting in a net dipole moment. In addition to London dispersion forces, ammonia also exhibits stronger intermolecular forces called hydrogen bonding. Hydrogen bonding occurs when a hydrogen atom is covalently bonded to a highly electronegative atom (such as nitrogen, oxygen, or fluorine) and is attracted to another electronegative atom in a neighboring molecule.\n\nThe presence of hydrogen bonding in ammonia leads to stronger intermolecular forces compared to the London dispersion forces in methane. As a result, more energy is required to overcome these forces and convert ammonia from a liquid to a gaseous state. This explains the higher boiling point of ammonia (−33.34°C) compared to methane (−161.5°C).\n\nIn summary, the difference in boiling points of molecules with similar molecular masses, such as methane and ammonia, is due to the differences in the types and strengths of intermolecular forces present in these substances. The stronger hydrogen bonding in ammonia leads to a higher boiling point compared to the weaker London dispersion forces in methane."
