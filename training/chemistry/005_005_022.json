    "message_2": "The structural differences between RNA and DNA play a significant role in their functions in coding and transmitting genetic information. Here are the key structural differences between RNA and DNA and how they affect their functions:\n\n1. Sugar component: DNA contains deoxyribose sugar, while RNA contains ribose sugar. The presence of an extra hydroxyl group (-OH) in RNA makes it more reactive and less stable compared to DNA. This is why DNA is more suitable for long-term storage of genetic information, while RNA is more suited for short-term tasks like transmitting genetic information and protein synthesis.\n\n2. Nucleotide bases: Both DNA and RNA have adenine (A), guanine (G), and cytosine (C) as their bases. However, DNA has thymine (T) as its fourth base, while RNA has uracil (U). This difference in base pairing (A-T in DNA and A-U in RNA) affects the stability of the nucleic acid structures and their interactions with proteins.\n\n3. Structure: DNA is a double-stranded molecule, forming a double helix, while RNA is usually single-stranded. The double-stranded structure of DNA provides a stable and protected environment for genetic information storage. In contrast, the single-stranded structure of RNA allows it to fold into various secondary and tertiary structures, which are essential for its diverse functions, such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.\n\n4. Function: DNA's primary function is to store and transmit genetic information, ensuring the continuity of genetic traits from one generation to another. RNA, on the other hand, has multiple roles in the expression of genetic information. For example, mRNA carries the genetic code from DNA to ribosomes for protein synthesis, tRNA brings amino acids to the ribosomes during translation, and rRNA is a structural and catalytic component of ribosomes.\n\nIn summary, the structural differences between RNA and DNA are crucial for their distinct roles in coding and transmitting genetic information. DNA's stability and double-stranded structure make it ideal for long-term storage of genetic information, while RNA's reactivity and single-stranded structure allow it to participate in various processes related to gene expression and protein synthesis."
