    "message_2": "To determine the purity of a given sample of aspirin based on its melting point determination, you will need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the melting point of the pure aspirin: The melting point of pure aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) is around 138-140°C.\n\n2. Measure the melting point of the given sample: You will need to use a melting point apparatus to measure the melting point of the given aspirin sample. Place a small amount of the sample in a capillary tube and insert it into the melting point apparatus. Gradually increase the temperature and observe the temperature range at which the sample starts to melt and completely melts.\n\n3. Compare the melting point of the sample with the pure aspirin: If the melting point of the sample is close to the melting point of pure aspirin (138-140°C), it indicates high purity. However, if the melting point of the sample is lower than the melting point of pure aspirin, it suggests the presence of impurities in the sample. The larger the difference between the melting points, the lower the purity of the sample.\n\n4. Calculate the purity percentage (optional): If you have access to the melting points of the possible impurities, you can use the mixed melting point method to estimate the purity percentage of the sample. This involves mixing known amounts of pure aspirin and the impurity, measuring the melting point of the mixture, and comparing it to the melting point of the sample. By doing this with different ratios of aspirin to impurity, you can estimate the percentage of aspirin in the sample.\n\nPlease note that melting point determination is a qualitative method for assessing purity, and it may not provide an exact percentage of purity. For a more accurate quantitative analysis, other methods such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or gas chromatography (GC) can be used."
