    "message_2": "During one cycle of the Citric Acid Cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle), the net gain of energy molecules is as follows:\n\n- 1 ATP (produced through substrate-level phosphorylation)\n- 3 NADH (produced from the oxidation of NAD+)\n- 1 FADH2 (produced from the oxidation of FAD)\n\nThese energy molecules are then utilized in the subsequent process of Oxidative Phosphorylation, which takes place in the mitochondria's inner membrane. During this process, NADH and FADH2 are oxidized, and their electrons are transferred through a series of protein complexes (the electron transport chain) to generate a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane.\n\nThe energy from this proton gradient is used by the enzyme ATP synthase to produce ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi). The theoretical yield of ATP through oxidation of one molecule of NADH in Oxidative Phosphorylation is 2.5, while the yield for one molecule of FADH2 is 1.5.\n\nSo, for each cycle of the Citric Acid Cycle, the total ATP production in Oxidative Phosphorylation is:\n\n- 3 NADH × 2.5 ATP/NADH = 7.5 ATP\n- 1 FADH2 × 1.5 ATP/FADH2 = 1.5 ATP\n\nAdding the 1 ATP generated through substrate-level phosphorylation in the Citric Acid Cycle, the total ATP production per cycle is approximately 10 (7.5 + 1.5 + 1). However, it is important to note that the actual ATP yield may vary depending on the efficiency of the electron transport chain and other cellular conditions."
