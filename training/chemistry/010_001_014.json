    "message_2": "To calculate the standard electrode potential for the half-reaction Mg2+(aq) + 2e- → Mg(s), we need to use a reference half-cell. Unfortunately, the information provided only gives us the standard electrode potentials for Cu2+(aq) + 2e- → Cu(s) and Ag+(aq) + e- → Ag(s). However, we can use the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) as a reference, which has a standard electrode potential of 0 V.\n\nThe standard electrode potentials for the given half-reactions with respect to the SHE are:\n\nCu2+(aq) + 2e- → Cu(s) : E°(Cu2+/Cu) = 0.34 V\nAg+(aq) + e- → Ag(s) : E°(Ag+/Ag) = 0.80 V\n\nNow, we need to find the standard electrode potential for the Mg2+/Mg half-cell. To do this, we can use the Nernst equation:\n\nE°(Mg2+/Mg) = E°(Cu2+/Cu) - E°(Ag+/Ag)\n\nHowever, this equation is not balanced, as the number of electrons involved in the Cu2+/Cu and Ag+/Ag half-reactions are different. To balance the equation, we can multiply the Ag+/Ag half-reaction by 2:\n\n2[Ag+(aq) + e- → Ag(s)] : 2E°(Ag+/Ag) = 1.60 V\n\nNow, we can use the balanced Nernst equation:\n\nE°(Mg2+/Mg) = E°(Cu2+/Cu) - 2E°(Ag+/Ag)\n\nE°(Mg2+/Mg) = 0.34 V - 1.60 V\nE°(Mg2+/Mg) = -1.26 V\n\nSo, the standard electrode potential for the half-reaction Mg2+(aq) + 2e- → Mg(s) is -1.26 V."
