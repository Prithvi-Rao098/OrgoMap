    "message_1": "What is the polarity of the bond between oxygen and hydrogen in a water molecule?",
    "message_2": "The bond between oxygen and hydrogen in a water molecule is polar. This is due to the difference in electronegativity between the oxygen atom (3.44) and the hydrogen atom (2.20). The more electronegative oxygen atom attracts the shared electrons more strongly, resulting in a partial negative charge (δ-) on the oxygen and a partial positive charge (δ+) on the hydrogen atoms. This creates a polar covalent bond within the water molecule."
