    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy of formation of propane (C3H8), we can use the combustion reaction of propane and apply Hess's Law. The balanced combustion reaction of propane is:\n\nC3H8 (g) + 5O2 (g) → 3CO2 (g) + 4H2O (l)\n\nNow, we can use the standard enthalpies of formation of carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) to find the standard enthalpy of formation of propane.\n\nΔHf° (C3H8) = Σ [ΔHf° (products)] - Σ [ΔHf° (reactants)]\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation of O2 is zero because it is in its elemental form. Therefore, we have:\n\nΔHf° (C3H8) = [3 × ΔHf° (CO2) + 4 × ΔHf° (H2O)] - [ΔHf° (C3H8) + 0]\n\nGiven the standard enthalpies of formation of CO2 and H2O:\n\nΔHf° (C3H8) = [3 × (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 4 × (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [ΔHf° (C3H8)]\n\nΔHf° (C3H8) = [-1180.5 kJ/mol + (-1143.2 kJ/mol)] - [ΔHf° (C3H8)]\n\nΔHf° (C3H8) = -2323.7 kJ/mol + ΔHf° (C3H8)\n\nNow, we can solve for the standard enthalpy of formation of propane:\n\nΔHf° (C3H8) = -2323.7 kJ/mol + ΔHf° (C3H8)\n\n2 × ΔHf° (C3H8) = -2323.7 kJ/mol\n\nΔHf° (C3H8) = -1161.85 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation of propane (C3H8) at 298 K and 1 atm pressure is approximately -1161.85 kJ/mol."
