    "message_2": "To calculate the change in enthalpy (ΔH) for the combustion of 10 grams of methane (CH4), we need to know the standard enthalpy of combustion for methane. The standard enthalpy of combustion for methane is -890.4 kJ/mol.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of methane (10 grams) to moles. The molar mass of methane is 12.01 g/mol (C) + 4 * 1.01 g/mol (H) = 16.05 g/mol.\n\nNow, we can find the moles of methane:\n10 g CH4 * (1 mol CH4 / 16.05 g CH4) = 0.623 mol CH4\n\nNext, we can calculate the change in enthalpy (ΔH) for the combustion of 0.623 mol of methane:\nΔH = moles of CH4 * standard enthalpy of combustion\nΔH = 0.623 mol CH4 * (-890.4 kJ/mol)\nΔH = -555.1 kJ\n\nTherefore, the change in enthalpy (ΔH) for the combustion of 10 grams of methane (CH4) at standard conditions is -555.1 kJ."
