    "message_2": "To determine the specific amount of nitrobenzene and chlorine gas needed to prepare 50 grams of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nC6H5NO2 + 2 Cl2 → C6H3Cl2NO2\n\nNow, we need to find the molar masses of the reactants and product:\n\nNitrobenzene (C6H5NO2): (6 × 12.01) + (5 × 1.01) + (14.01) + (2 × 16.00) = 123.11 g/mol\nChlorine gas (Cl2): 2 × 35.45 = 70.90 g/mol\n2,4-dichloronitrobenzene (C6H3Cl2NO2): (6 × 12.01) + (3 × 1.01) + (2 × 35.45) + (14.01) + (2 × 16.00) = 197.00 g/mol\n\nWe are given that we want to prepare 50 grams of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene. To find the moles of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene, we use the following equation:\n\nmoles = mass / molar mass\n\nmoles of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene = 50 g / 197.00 g/mol = 0.2538 mol\n\nNow, we can use stoichiometry to find the moles of nitrobenzene and chlorine gas needed for the reaction:\n\nmoles of nitrobenzene = moles of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene = 0.2538 mol\nmoles of chlorine gas = 2 × moles of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene = 2 × 0.2538 mol = 0.5076 mol\n\nFinally, we can convert the moles of nitrobenzene and chlorine gas to grams:\n\nmass of nitrobenzene = moles × molar mass = 0.2538 mol × 123.11 g/mol = 31.24 g\nmass of chlorine gas = moles × molar mass = 0.5076 mol × 70.90 g/mol = 36.00 g\n\nTherefore, to prepare 50 grams of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene, you will need 31.24 grams of nitrobenzene and 36.00 grams of chlorine gas."
