    "message_2": "To find the electronegativity difference between sodium and chlorine in NaCl, we need to know the electronegativity values of both elements. Electronegativity is a measure of the tendency of an atom to attract a bonding pair of electrons.\n\nThe Pauling scale is a commonly used scale for electronegativity values. On the Pauling scale, the electronegativity of sodium (Na) is 0.93, and the electronegativity of chlorine (Cl) is 3.16.\n\nTo find the electronegativity difference, subtract the electronegativity of sodium from that of chlorine:\n\nElectronegativity difference = Electronegativity of Cl - Electronegativity of Na\nElectronegativity difference = 3.16 - 0.93\nElectronegativity difference = 2.23\n\nSo, the electronegativity difference between sodium and chlorine in NaCl is 2.23."
