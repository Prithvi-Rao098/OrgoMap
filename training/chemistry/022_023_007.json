    "message_2": "To find the Ka of acetic acid, we can use the formula:\n\nKa = [H+][A-]/[HA]\n\nFirst, we need to find the concentration of hydrogen ions [H+] using the pH value:\n\npH = -log[H+]\n\n4.76 = -log[H+]\n\nNow, we need to find the concentration of hydrogen ions:\n\n[H+] = 10^(-pH)\n[H+] = 10^(-4.76)\n[H+] = 1.74 x 10^(-5) M\n\nSince acetic acid (CH3COOH) is a weak acid, it will partially dissociate into hydrogen ions (H+) and acetate ions (CH3COO-). We can assume that the concentration of acetate ions [A-] is equal to the concentration of hydrogen ions [H+], as one molecule of acetic acid produces one hydrogen ion and one acetate ion.\n\n[A-] = [H+] = 1.74 x 10^(-5) M\n\nNow, we need to find the concentration of undissociated acetic acid [HA]. Since the initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.1 M and it partially dissociates, we can subtract the concentration of dissociated hydrogen ions from the initial concentration:\n\n[HA] = Initial concentration - [H+]\n[HA] = 0.1 M - 1.74 x 10^(-5) M\n[HA] â‰ˆ 0.1 M (since 1.74 x 10^(-5) is very small compared to 0.1)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Ka formula:\n\nKa = [H+][A-]/[HA]\nKa = (1.74 x 10^(-5))(1.74 x 10^(-5))/0.1\nKa = 3.03 x 10^(-10)\n\nThe Acid Dissociation Constant (Ka) of the 0.1 M solution of acetic acid with a pH of 4.76 is approximately 3.03 x 10^(-10)."
