    "message_2": "To find the minimum detectable activity (MDA) of a Geiger-Müller counter, we need to consider the background count rate and the sample count rate.\n\nLet's first find the count rate of the sample.\n\nGiven:\nSample activity = 1 µCi\nSample counts = 200 counts\nTime taken = 10 seconds\n\nSample count rate = Sample counts / Time taken\nSample count rate = 200 counts / 10 seconds\nSample count rate = 20 counts/second\n\nNow, let's find the background count rate.\n\nGiven:\nTotal counts (sample + background) = 200 counts\nTime taken = 10 seconds\n\nTotal count rate = Total counts / Time taken\nTotal count rate = 200 counts / 10 seconds\nTotal count rate = 20 counts/second\n\nSince the total count rate is equal to the sum of the sample count rate and the background count rate, we can find the background count rate.\n\nBackground count rate = Total count rate - Sample count rate\nBackground count rate = 20 counts/second - 20 counts/second\nBackground count rate = 0 counts/second\n\nNow, let's find the minimum detectable activity (MDA).\n\nMDA = (Sample activity * Background count rate) / Sample count rate\nMDA = (1 µCi * 0 counts/second) / 20 counts/second\nMDA = 0 µCi\n\nThe minimum detectable activity of the Geiger-Müller counter in this case is 0 µCi. However, this result is not realistic, as there is always some background radiation present. This could mean that the given data is not accurate or there might be some error in the measurement. In a real scenario, the background count rate would be greater than 0 counts/second, and the minimum detectable activity would be a positive value."
