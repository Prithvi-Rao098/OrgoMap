    "message_2": "The introduction of different substituents at specific positions in an organic molecule can significantly affect its electronic excited states and optical properties. This is because the substituents can alter the electron distribution, molecular orbital energies, and the overall molecular structure. Consequently, these changes can lead to variations in the absorption spectra of the molecule.\n\nTo provide a theoretical calculation of the electronic transitions and energetics, we can use computational chemistry methods such as Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) or Configuration Interaction Singles (CIS). These methods can help us predict the electronic transitions and their corresponding energies, which can be compared to the experimental absorption spectra.\n\nHere are the general steps to perform the theoretical calculations:\n\n1. Choose the appropriate computational method and basis set: Depending on the size and complexity of the molecule, select a suitable method (e.g., TD-DFT or CIS) and basis set (e.g., 6-31G(d,p) or cc-pVDZ) for the calculations.\n\n2. Optimize the molecular geometry: Perform a geometry optimization of the ground-state molecule using the chosen method and basis set. This will provide the most stable molecular structure for the subsequent calculations.\n\n3. Calculate the electronic excited states: Using the optimized geometry, perform a calculation of the electronic excited states and their corresponding energies. This will provide information on the possible electronic transitions and their energetics.\n\n4. Analyze the results: Compare the calculated electronic transitions and their energies to the experimental absorption spectra. Identify the main transitions responsible for the observed changes in the spectra and determine the effect of the substituents on the electronic excited states and optical properties of the molecule.\n\nIn conclusion, the introduction of different substituents at specific positions can significantly affect the electronic excited states and optical properties of an organic molecule. Theoretical calculations using computational chemistry methods can help explain the observed changes in absorption spectra and provide insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms."
