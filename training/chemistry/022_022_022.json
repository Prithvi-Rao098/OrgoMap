    "message_1": "A chemistry student is asked to determine the effect of temperature and pressure on the equilibrium of the reaction: 2NO2(g) ⇋ N2O4(g) using Le Chatelier’s principle. The initial concentration of NO2(g) is 0.5 mol/L and the reaction is carried out at 25°C. How will the equilibrium shift if the temperature is increased to 100°C and the pressure is decreased to 0.5 atm?",
    "message_2": "Le Chatelier's principle states that if a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in temperature, pressure, or concentration of reactants or products, the system will adjust its equilibrium position to counteract the change.\n\nFor the reaction: 2NO2(g) ⇋ N2O4(g)\n\n1. Effect of temperature:\nThe reaction is exothermic (releases heat) in the forward direction, as the formation of N2O4 from NO2 releases heat. When the temperature is increased from 25°C to 100°C, the system will try to counteract the increase in temperature by shifting the equilibrium towards the endothermic (absorbs heat) direction. In this case, the endothermic direction is the reverse reaction (breaking N2O4 into NO2). Therefore, the equilibrium will shift to the left, favoring the formation of NO2.\n\n2. Effect of pressure:\nWhen the pressure is decreased from 1 atm (standard pressure) to 0.5 atm, the system will try to counteract the decrease in pressure by shifting the equilibrium towards the side with more gas molecules. In this reaction, there are 2 moles of NO2 gas on the left side and 1 mole of N2O4 gas on the right side. Therefore, the equilibrium will shift to the left, favoring the formation of NO2.\n\nIn conclusion, when the temperature is increased to 100°C and the pressure is decreased to 0.5 atm, the equilibrium of the reaction will shift to the left, favoring the formation of NO2."
