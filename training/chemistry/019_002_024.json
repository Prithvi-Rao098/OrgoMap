    "message_2": "To determine the standard enthalpy of formation for propane (C3H8), we need to find the enthalpy change for the formation reaction:\n\nC3H8(g) = 3C(graphite) + 4H2(g)\n\nWe can do this by manipulating the given reactions and their enthalpies to match the formation reaction of propane. \n\nFirst, we need to reverse the first reaction and multiply it by 3 to get 3 moles of CO2:\n\n3CO2(g) → 3C(graphite) + 3O2(g) ΔH° = 3 * 393.5 kJ/mol = 1180.5 kJ/mol\n\nNext, we need to reverse the second reaction and multiply it by 2 to get 4 moles of H2:\n\n2H2O(l) → 2H2(g) + O2(g) ΔH° = 2 * 572.4 kJ/mol = 1144.8 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can add these two manipulated reactions and the given propane combustion reaction:\n\n3CO2(g) + 4H2O(l) ΔH° = -2220 kJ/mol\n3CO2(g) → 3C(graphite) + 3O2(g) ΔH° = 1180.5 kJ/mol\n2H2O(l) → 2H2(g) + O2(g) ΔH° = 1144.8 kJ/mol\n----------------------------------------------\nC3H8(g) = 3C(graphite) + 4H2(g) ΔH° = -2220 + 1180.5 + 1144.8\n\nΔH° = -2220 + 1180.5 + 1144.8 = 105.3 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy of formation for propane (C3H8) is 105.3 kJ/mol."
