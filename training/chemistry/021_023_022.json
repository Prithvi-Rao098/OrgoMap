    "message_2": "Isomerism is the phenomenon in which two or more compounds have the same molecular formula but different structural arrangements of atoms. In the case of C4H10, we are dealing with structural isomers, which are compounds with the same molecular formula but different connectivity of atoms.\n\nThere are two possible structural isomers for the molecular formula C4H10:\n\n1. n-Butane: In this isomer, the four carbon atoms are connected in a straight chain, with each of the remaining carbon atoms bonded to three hydrogen atoms. The structure can be represented as CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3.\n\n2. Isobutane (also known as methylpropane): In this isomer, three carbon atoms are connected in a straight chain, and the fourth carbon atom is connected to the middle carbon atom of the chain. The structure can be represented as (CH3)3C-CH3 or CH3-C(CH3)2-CH3.\n\nThese are the two possible structural isomers for a molecule with the molecular formula C4H10: n-butane and isobutane."
