    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant (K) for the given reaction, we can use the expression for the reaction quotient (Q) and set it equal to K since the reaction is at equilibrium. The expression for Q is given by:\n\nQ = [Zn^2+][H2] / ([H^+]^2)\n\nAt equilibrium, Q = K. Therefore,\n\nK = [Zn^2+][H2] / ([H^+]^2)\n\nWe are given the concentration of Zn^2+ as 0.25 M, [H^+] as 2.5 × 10^-3 M, and the pressure of H2 as 0.8 atm. However, we need to convert the pressure of H2 to its concentration using the ideal gas law:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nWhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant (0.0821 L atm/mol K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin. We can rearrange the equation to solve for the concentration (n/V) of H2:\n\nConcentration of H2 = P / (RT)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nConcentration of H2 = 0.8 atm / (0.0821 L atm/mol K * 298 K) = 0.0325 M\n\nNow we can calculate the equilibrium constant K:\n\nK = [0.25][0.0325] / ([2.5 × 10^-3]^2)\nK = 0.008125 / (6.25 × 10^-6)\nK = 1300\n\nThe equilibrium constant for the given reaction is approximately 1300."
