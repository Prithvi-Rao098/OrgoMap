    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise problem for the student to solve:\n\nFor the electrochemical cell with the following half-reactions:\n\nAg^+(aq) + e^- → Ag(s) (E° = 0.80 V)\nCu^2+(aq) + 2e^- → Cu(s) (E° = 0.34 V)\n\nCalculate the equilibrium constant (K) for the overall reaction of Ag^+(aq) + Cu(s) → Ag(s) + Cu^2+(aq) at 25°C.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant (K) for the overall reaction, we first need to determine the standard cell potential (E°cell) and then use the Nernst equation to find K.\n\n1. Determine the overall balanced redox reaction and the standard cell potential (E°cell):\n\nThe overall balanced redox reaction is obtained by combining the two half-reactions:\n\nAg^+(aq) + e^- → Ag(s) (E° = 0.80 V)\nCu^2+(aq) + 2e^- → Cu(s) (E° = 0.34 V)\n\nTo combine these reactions, we need to multiply the first reaction by 2 to balance the number of electrons:\n\n2(Ag^+(aq) + e^- → Ag(s)) (E° = 0.80 V)\nCu^2+(aq) + 2e^- → Cu(s) (E° = 0.34 V)\n\nNow, we can add the reactions:\n\n2Ag^+(aq) + Cu(s) → 2Ag(s) + Cu^2+(aq)\n\nNext, we calculate the standard cell potential (E°cell) by subtracting the reduction potential of the half-reaction being reversed (oxidation) from the reduction potential of the half-reaction that remains as reduction:\n\nE°cell = E°(reduction) - E°(oxidation)\nE°cell = 0.80 V - 0.34 V\nE°cell = 0.46 V\n\n2. Use the Nernst equation to find the equilibrium constant (K):\n\nThe Nernst equation relates the standard cell potential (E°cell), the equilibrium constant (K), and the temperature (T):\n\nE°cell = (RT/nF) * ln(K)\n\nWhere R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin (25°C = 298 K), n is the number of electrons transferred (n = 2), and F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol).\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for K:\n\nK = exp(nFE°cell/RT)\n\nPlug in the values:\n\nK = exp(2 * 96,485 C/mol * 0.46 V / (8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K))\n\nK = exp(89,525.8 / 2,468.5)\n\nK = exp(36.27)\n\nK ≈ 1.5 × 10^15\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (K) for the overall reaction of Ag^+(aq) + Cu(s) → Ag(s) + Cu^2+(aq) at 25°C is approximately 1.5 × 10^15."
