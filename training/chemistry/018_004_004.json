    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Arrhenius equation, which relates the rate constant (k) of a reaction to its activation energy (Ea) and temperature (T):\n\nk = A * e^(-Ea / R * T)\n\nwhere:\nk is the rate constant,\nA is the pre-exponential factor,\nEa is the activation energy,\nR is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol*K), and\nT is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nWe are given two rate constants (k1 and k2) at two different temperatures (T1 and T2). We can set up two equations using the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk1 = A * e^(-Ea / R * T1)\nk2 = A * e^(-Ea / R * T2)\n\nWe can solve for the activation energy (Ea) by dividing the second equation by the first equation:\n\nk2 / k1 = (A * e^(-Ea / R * T2)) / (A * e^(-Ea / R * T1))\n\nThe pre-exponential factor (A) cancels out:\n\nk2 / k1 = e^(-Ea / R * (1/T1 - 1/T2))\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nk1 = 0.0035 s^-1 (at 25°C or 298.15 K)\nk2 = 0.014 s^-1 (at 50°C or 323.15 K)\n\n0.014 / 0.0035 = e^(-Ea / 8.314 * (1/298.15 - 1/323.15))\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(0.014 / 0.0035) = -Ea / 8.314 * (1/298.15 - 1/323.15)\n\nNow, we can solve for Ea:\n\nEa = -8.314 * ln(0.014 / 0.0035) / (1/298.15 - 1/323.15)\n\nEa ≈ 52,000 J/mol\n\nThe activation energy for the reaction is approximately 52,000 J/mol."
