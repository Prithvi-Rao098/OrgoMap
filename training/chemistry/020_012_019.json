    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log ([A-]/[HA])\n\nwhere pH is the solution's pH, pKa is the acid dissociation constant, [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate ion), and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid (acetic acid).\n\nInitially, the pH of the 0.1 M acetic acid solution can be calculated using the initial concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion (which is 0 before adding sodium acetate):\n\nInitial pH = 4.76 + log (0/[0.1])\nInitial pH = 4.76 + log (0) â‰ˆ 4.76 (since log(0) is undefined, but the concentration of acetate ion is negligible)\n\nNow, let's find the new concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion after adding 0.05 moles of sodium acetate. Assume the volume of the solution is 1 L for simplicity.\n\nNew [HA] = (0.1 - 0.05) moles / 1 L = 0.05 M\nNew [A-] = 0.05 moles / 1 L = 0.05 M\n\nNow, we can calculate the new pH using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\nNew pH = 4.76 + log (0.05/0.05)\nNew pH = 4.76 + log (1)\nNew pH = 4.76 + 0\nNew pH = 4.76\n\nSince the initial pH and the new pH are both 4.76, there is no change in the pH of the solution when 0.05 moles of sodium acetate is added."
