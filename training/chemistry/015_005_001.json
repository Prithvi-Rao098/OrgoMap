    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the given reaction, we need to use the following formula:\n\nΔH° = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH° is the standard enthalpy change, and ΔHf° is the standard enthalpy of formation for each substance.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard enthalpy of formation for each substance involved in the reaction:\n\nMg(s): ΔHf° = 0 kJ/mol (since it is in its standard state)\nHCl(aq): ΔHf° = -167.2 kJ/mol\nMgCl2(aq): ΔHf° = -641.3 kJ/mol\nH2(g): ΔHf° = 0 kJ/mol (since it is in its standard state)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nΔH° = [(-641.3 kJ/mol) + (0 kJ/mol)] - [(0 kJ/mol) + 2(-167.2 kJ/mol)]\nΔH° = (-641.3 kJ/mol) - (-334.4 kJ/mol)\nΔH° = -306.9 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change for the given reaction at 298 K is -306.9 kJ/mol."
