    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of vaporization, we first need to determine the number of moles of water being converted to steam. The molar mass of water is 18.015 g/mol.\n\nNumber of moles = mass / molar mass\nNumber of moles = 50.0 g / 18.015 g/mol\nNumber of moles = 2.775 moles\n\nNow, we can use the molar heat of vaporization to find the total enthalpy of vaporization.\n\nEnthalpy of vaporization = number of moles × molar heat of vaporization\nEnthalpy of vaporization = 2.775 moles × 40.7 kJ/mol\n\nEnthalpy of vaporization = 112.94 kJ\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy of vaporization of 50.0 g of water at 100°C is 112.94 kJ."
