    "message_2": "To determine the rate constant and activation energy of the polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) using a free-radical initiator at a temperature of 60°C, we need to refer to the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk = Ae^(-Ea/RT)\n\nwhere:\nk = rate constant\nA = pre-exponential factor\nEa = activation energy (in J/mol)\nR = gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\nT = temperature (in Kelvin)\n\nHowever, the specific values for A and Ea for the polymerization of MMA using a free-radical initiator are not provided. These values are typically determined experimentally and can vary depending on the specific initiator used and the reaction conditions.\n\nIf you have the experimental data or can provide the values for A and Ea, I can help you calculate the rate constant (k) at 60°C."
