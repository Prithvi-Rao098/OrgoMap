    "message_2": "The inorganic compound formed by the combination of sodium and chlorine atoms is sodium chloride (NaCl). This compound is ionic in nature. \n\nThe reason for this is that sodium (Na) is a metal from Group 1 of the periodic table, and chlorine (Cl) is a non-metal from Group 17. Sodium has one electron in its outermost shell, while chlorine has seven electrons in its outermost shell. In order to achieve a stable electron configuration, sodium loses its one valence electron, forming a positively charged ion (Na+), and chlorine gains one electron, forming a negatively charged ion (Cl-). The electrostatic attraction between these oppositely charged ions results in the formation of an ionic bond, creating the ionic compound sodium chloride (NaCl)."
