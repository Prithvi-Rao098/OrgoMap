    "message_2": "To draw the Lewis structure of BrF5 (Bromine Pentafluoride), follow these steps:\n\n1. Count the total number of valence electrons: Bromine (Br) has 7 valence electrons, and Fluorine (F) has 7 valence electrons. Since there are 5 Fluorine atoms, the total number of valence electrons is 7 (Br) + 5 * 7 (F) = 42 valence electrons.\n\n2. Identify the central atom: Bromine (Br) is the central atom in BrF5, as it is the least electronegative element in the molecule.\n\n3. Place the central atom and connect the surrounding atoms with single bonds: Place Br in the center and connect it to the 5 F atoms with single bonds. This uses up 10 valence electrons (5 single bonds * 2 electrons per bond).\n\n4. Distribute the remaining valence electrons as lone pairs: There are 32 valence electrons left (42 - 10). Place 3 lone pairs (6 electrons) on the Br atom and 6 lone pairs (12 electrons) on each F atom, so that each F atom has an octet configuration.\n\n5. Check if the central atom has an octet configuration: Bromine has an expanded octet configuration, as it has 5 single bonds and 3 lone pairs, which totals to 10 electrons around it. This is acceptable because Br is in the 4th period of the periodic table and can accommodate more than 8 electrons.\n\nThe Lewis structure of BrF5 is:\n\n          F\n          |\nF - Br - F\n          |\n          F\n          |\n          F"
