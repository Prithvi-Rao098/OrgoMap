    "message_2": "To determine the reactivity of these inorganic compounds, we need to consider their electronic configurations and the stability of the ions involved.\n\na) Sodium chloride (NaCl) and magnesium oxide (MgO)\n\nSodium chloride consists of sodium ions (Na+) and chloride ions (Cl-). Sodium has an electronic configuration of [Ne]3s1, and when it loses one electron, it forms a stable Na+ ion with the configuration of [Ne]. Chlorine has an electronic configuration of [Ne]3s2 3p5, and when it gains one electron, it forms a stable Cl- ion with the configuration of [Ar].\n\nMagnesium oxide consists of magnesium ions (Mg2+) and oxide ions (O2-). Magnesium has an electronic configuration of [Ne]3s2, and when it loses two electrons, it forms a stable Mg2+ ion with the configuration of [Ne]. Oxygen has an electronic configuration of [He]2s2 2p4, and when it gains two electrons, it forms a stable O2- ion with the configuration of [Ne].\n\nComparing the two compounds, MgO has a higher charge on both the cation and anion, which leads to stronger electrostatic forces between the ions and a more stable ionic lattice. This makes MgO less reactive than NaCl.\n\nb) Copper (II) oxide (CuO) and silver oxide (Ag2O)\n\nCopper (II) oxide consists of copper (II) ions (Cu2+) and oxide ions (O2-). Copper has an electronic configuration of [Ar]3d10 4s1, and when it loses two electrons, it forms a Cu2+ ion with the configuration of [Ar]3d9.\n\nSilver oxide consists of silver ions (Ag+) and oxide ions (O2-). Silver has an electronic configuration of [Kr]4d10 5s1, and when it loses one electron, it forms a stable Ag+ ion with the configuration of [Kr]4d10.\n\nComparing the two compounds, CuO has a higher charge on the cation (Cu2+) than Ag2O (Ag+), which leads to stronger electrostatic forces between the ions and a more stable ionic lattice. This makes CuO less reactive than Ag2O.\n\nIn conclusion, between the two pairs of inorganic compounds, NaCl and Ag2O have higher reactivity due to their less stable ionic lattices and weaker electrostatic forces between their ions, which can be explained by their electronic configurations."
