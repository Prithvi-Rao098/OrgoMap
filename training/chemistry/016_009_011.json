    "message_1": "Calculate the enthalpy of vaporization of water at a temperature of 100 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 1 atm, given that the boiling point of water is 100 degrees Celsius and its enthalpy of vaporization at standard conditions (100 degrees Celsius and 1 atm) is 40.7 kJ/mol.",
    "message_2": "Since the given temperature and pressure are the same as the standard conditions (100 degrees Celsius and 1 atm), the enthalpy of vaporization of water at these conditions is the same as the given value. Therefore, the enthalpy of vaporization of water at 100 degrees Celsius and 1 atm is 40.7 kJ/mol."
