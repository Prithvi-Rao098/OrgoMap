    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Arrhenius equation, which relates the rate constant (k) of a reaction to its activation energy (Ea), temperature (T), and the pre-exponential factor (A):\n\nk = A * e^(-Ea / R * T)\n\nwhere R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol*K).\n\nWe have two sets of data: k1 = 2.5 x 10^-3 s^-1 at T1 = 450 K and k2 = 5.0 x 10^-2 s^-1 at T2 = 500 K. We can set up two equations:\n\nk1 = A * e^(-Ea / R * T1)\nk2 = A * e^(-Ea / R * T2)\n\nWe can solve for A in terms of Ea and T1 in the first equation:\n\nA = k1 / e^(-Ea / R * T1)\n\nSubstitute this expression for A into the second equation:\n\nk2 = (k1 / e^(-Ea / R * T1)) * e^(-Ea / R * T2)\n\nNow, we can solve for Ea:\n\nk2 * e^(-Ea / R * T1) = k1 * e^(-Ea / R * T2)\n\nDivide both sides by k1:\n\nk2 / k1 = e^(-Ea / R * (T2 - T1))\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(k2 / k1) = -Ea / R * (T2 - T1)\n\nRearrange to solve for Ea:\n\nEa = -R * (T2 - T1) * ln(k2 / k1)\n\nNow, plug in the given values:\n\nEa = -8.314 J/mol*K * (500 K - 450 K) * ln(5.0 x 10^-2 s^-1 / 2.5 x 10^-3 s^-1)\n\nEa = -8.314 J/mol*K * 50 K * ln(20)\n\nEa ≈ 8314 J/mol * 50 * 2.9957\n\nEa ≈ 1245000 J/mol\n\nEa ≈ 124.5 kJ/mol\n\nThe activation energy for the reaction between hydrogen and iodine gases to form hydrogen iodide is approximately 124.5 kJ/mol."
