    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a precise problem for the student to solve:\n\nWhat is the total number of electrons that are transferred during the reaction between an aqueous solution of silver nitrate and metallic copper when copper is placed in the silver nitrate solution? The reaction is represented by the following half-reactions:\n\nAg+ (aq) + e- --> Ag (s)     E° = +0.80 V\nCu (s) --> Cu2+ (aq) + 2e-   E° = -0.34 V\n\nPlease calculate the number of electrons that are transferred during the reaction based on the given information.",
    "message_2": "To find the total number of electrons transferred during the reaction, we need to first balance the half-reactions and then combine them to form the overall balanced redox reaction.\n\n1. Balance the half-reactions:\n\nFor the reduction half-reaction (Ag+ + e- → Ag), it is already balanced.\n\nFor the oxidation half-reaction (Cu → Cu2+ + 2e-), it is also balanced.\n\n2. Combine the half-reactions:\n\nTo combine the half-reactions, we need to make sure the number of electrons in both half-reactions is equal. In this case, the reduction half-reaction has 1 electron, and the oxidation half-reaction has 2 electrons. Therefore, we need to multiply the reduction half-reaction by 2 to equalize the number of electrons:\n\n2(Ag+ + e- → Ag)\nCu → Cu2+ + 2e-\n\nNow, we can combine the half-reactions:\n\n2Ag+ + Cu → 2Ag + Cu2+\n\nIn this balanced redox reaction, a total of 2 electrons are transferred from copper to silver ions."
