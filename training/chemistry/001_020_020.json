    "message_2": "The electrophilic addition reaction between hydrogen bromide (HBr) and propene (C3H6) involves a two-step mechanism. Here's a stepwise explanation of the reaction:\n\nStep 1: Protonation of the alkene\nIn the first step, the hydrogen bromide molecule acts as an electrophile, with the hydrogen atom being partially positive (δ+) and the bromine atom being partially negative (δ-). The double bond in propene is a region of high electron density, which attracts the partially positive hydrogen atom of HBr. The electrons in the double bond move towards the hydrogen atom, forming a bond between one of the carbon atoms of the double bond and the hydrogen atom. This results in the formation of a carbocation intermediate and a bromide ion (Br-).\n\nThere are two possible carbocations that can be formed in this reaction: a primary carbocation (when the hydrogen atom adds to the terminal carbon atom) and a secondary carbocation (when the hydrogen atom adds to the central carbon atom). However, the secondary carbocation is more stable due to hyperconjugation, so it is the major intermediate formed in this reaction.\n\nStep 2: Nucleophilic attack by the bromide ion\nIn the second step, the bromide ion (Br-) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the positively charged carbon atom in the carbocation intermediate. The electrons from the bromide ion form a bond with the carbocation, resulting in the formation of the final product, 2-bromopropane (C3H7Br).\n\nIn summary, the electrophilic addition reaction between hydrogen bromide and propene proceeds through a two-step mechanism involving the formation of a carbocation intermediate and a nucleophilic attack by the bromide ion. The final product of the reaction is 2-bromopropane."
