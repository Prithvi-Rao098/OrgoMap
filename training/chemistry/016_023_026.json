    "message_2": "To find the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 2 moles of sucrose, we can use the given ΔH°rxn for the hydrolysis of sucrose, which is -126.3 kJ/mol. Since we have 2 moles of sucrose, we can simply multiply the ΔH°rxn by the number of moles:\n\nΔH = ΔH°rxn × moles of sucrose\nΔH = (-126.3 kJ/mol) × 2 moles\nΔH = -252.6 kJ\n\nSo, the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 2 moles of sucrose in aqueous solution is -252.6 kJ."
