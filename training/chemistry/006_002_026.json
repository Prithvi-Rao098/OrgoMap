    "message_2": "To calculate the rate of polymerization, we can use the following equation:\n\nRate = k × [Initiator]\n\nWhere:\nRate = rate of polymerization\nk = rate constant (0.04 s^-1)\n[Initiator] = initial concentration of initiator (0.05 mol/L)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nRate = (0.04 s^-1) × (0.05 mol/L)\n\nRate = 0.002 mol/(L·s)\n\nSo, the rate of polymerization of vinyl acetate at 60°C with an initial concentration of initiator of 0.05 mol/L and a rate constant of 0.04 s^-1 is 0.002 mol/(L·s)."
