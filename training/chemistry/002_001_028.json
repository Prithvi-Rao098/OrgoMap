    "message_1": "A chemistry student is given a chemical equation for the reaction between calcium chloride and sodium carbonate. The equation is unbalanced and the student must balance it, while ensuring that the correct stoichiometric coefficients for each compound are used. The student must then calculate the mass of product formed when 5.0 grams of calcium chloride react completely with excess sodium carbonate. What is the mass of the product formed?",
    "message_2": "First, let's balance the chemical equation for the reaction between calcium chloride (CaCl2) and sodium carbonate (Na2CO3):\n\nCaCl2 + Na2CO3 → CaCO3 + 2NaCl\n\nNow that the equation is balanced, we can use stoichiometry to determine the mass of the product formed (calcium carbonate, CaCO3) when 5.0 grams of calcium chloride react completely with excess sodium carbonate.\n\nFirst, we need to find the molar mass of calcium chloride (CaCl2):\nCa = 40.08 g/mol\nCl = 35.45 g/mol\n\nMolar mass of CaCl2 = 40.08 + (2 × 35.45) = 111.0 g/mol\n\nNow, we can convert the mass of calcium chloride to moles:\n5.0 g CaCl2 × (1 mol CaCl2 / 111.0 g CaCl2) = 0.0450 mol CaCl2\n\nFrom the balanced chemical equation, we can see that 1 mole of CaCl2 reacts to produce 1 mole of CaCO3. Therefore, the moles of CaCO3 produced will be the same as the moles of CaCl2 reacted:\n\n0.0450 mol CaCl2 × (1 mol CaCO3 / 1 mol CaCl2) = 0.0450 mol CaCO3\n\nNow, we need to find the molar mass of calcium carbonate (CaCO3):\nCa = 40.08 g/mol\nC = 12.01 g/mol\nO = 16.00 g/mol\n\nMolar mass of CaCO3 = 40.08 + 12.01 + (3 × 16.00) = 100.09 g/mol\n\nFinally, we can convert the moles of CaCO3 produced to grams:\n0.0450 mol CaCO3 × (100.09 g CaCO3 / 1 mol CaCO3) = 4.50 g CaCO3\n\nSo, the mass of the product (calcium carbonate) formed when 5.0 grams of calcium chloride react completely with excess sodium carbonate is 4.50 grams."
