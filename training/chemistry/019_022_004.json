Given the balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nC2H5OH (l) + 3O2 (g) -> 2CO2 (g) + 3H2O (l)\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation for the reactants and products are:\n\nC2H5OH (l) = -277.7 kJ/mol\nO2 (g) = 0 kJ/mol\nCO2 (g) = -393.5 kJ/mol\nH2O (l) = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\n(Note: assume that the heat of reaction is equal to the standard enthalpy change.)",
    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of 5.36 grams of ethanol, we first need to calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction using the given standard enthalpies of formation. We can do this using Hess's Law:\n\nΔH_reaction = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nΔH_reaction = [2(-393.5 kJ/mol) + 3(-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [-277.7 kJ/mol + 3(0 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH_reaction = (-787 kJ + -857.4 kJ) - (-277.7 kJ)\nΔH_reaction = -1644.4 kJ + 277.7 kJ\nΔH_reaction = -1366.7 kJ\n\nNow that we have the standard enthalpy change for the reaction, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of 5.36 grams of ethanol. First, we need to find the number of moles of ethanol:\n\nMolecular weight of ethanol (C2H5OH) = (2 * 12.01 g/mol) + (6 * 1.01 g/mol) + (1 * 16.00 g/mol) = 46.07 g/mol\n\nmoles of ethanol = 5.36 g / 46.07 g/mol = 0.1163 mol\n\nFinally, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of 5.36 grams of ethanol:\n\nΔH_combustion = ΔH_reaction * moles of ethanol\nΔH_combustion = -1366.7 kJ/mol * 0.1163 mol\nΔH_combustion = -158.8 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the combustion of 5.36 grams of ethanol is approximately -158.8 kJ."
