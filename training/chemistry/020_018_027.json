If the equilibrium constant of the formation of the FeSCN2+ complex ion is 3.0 x 10^3, calculate the concentration of FeSCN2+ complex ion at equilibrium when the initial concentration of thiocyanate ions is doubled.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table and the equilibrium constant expression. The balanced chemical equation for the formation of the FeSCN2+ complex ion is:\n\nFe3+ (aq) + SCN- (aq) ⇌ FeSCN2+ (aq)\n\nLet's first find the equilibrium concentrations of Fe3+, SCN-, and FeSCN2+ in the original solution.\n\nInitial concentrations:\n[Fe3+] = 0.5 M\n[SCN-] = 0.5 M\n[FeSCN2+] = 0 M\n\nChange in concentrations:\n[Fe3+] = -x\n[SCN-] = -x\n[FeSCN2+] = +x\n\nEquilibrium concentrations:\n[Fe3+] = 0.5 - x\n[SCN-] = 0.5 - x\n[FeSCN2+] = x\n\nNow we can write the equilibrium constant expression:\n\nK = [FeSCN2+] / ([Fe3+] * [SCN-]) = 3.0 x 10^3\n\nSubstitute the equilibrium concentrations:\n\n3.0 x 10^3 = x / ((0.5 - x) * (0.5 - x))\n\nNow we need to solve for x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of FeSCN2+.\n\nSince K is large, we can assume that x is small compared to 0.5, so we can simplify the equation:\n\n3.0 x 10^3 ≈ x / (0.5 * 0.5)\n\nx ≈ 3.0 x 10^3 * 0.25\nx ≈ 0.75 M\n\nNow let's find the equilibrium concentration of FeSCN2+ when the initial concentration of thiocyanate ions is doubled:\n\nInitial concentrations:\n[Fe3+] = 0.5 M\n[SCN-] = 1.0 M (doubled)\n[FeSCN2+] = 0 M\n\nChange in concentrations:\n[Fe3+] = -x\n[SCN-] = -x\n[FeSCN2+] = +x\n\nEquilibrium concentrations:\n[Fe3+] = 0.5 - x\n[SCN-] = 1.0 - x\n[FeSCN2+] = x\n\nSubstitute the equilibrium concentrations into the equilibrium constant expression:\n\n3.0 x 10^3 = x / ((0.5 - x) * (1.0 - x))\n\nAgain, since K is large, we can assume that x is small compared to 0.5 and 1.0:\n\n3.0 x 10^3 ≈ x / (0.5 * 1.0)\n\nx ≈ 3.0 x 10^3 * 0.5\nx ≈ 1.5 M\n\nSo, the concentration of FeSCN2+ complex ion at equilibrium when the initial concentration of thiocyanate ions is doubled is 1.5 M."
