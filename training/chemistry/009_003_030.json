    "message_2": "To calculate the energy release during the nuclear fission of one uranium-235 atom, we can use Einstein's famous equation, E=mc^2, where E is the energy, m is the mass difference, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the mass difference between the original uranium-235 atom and the two fission products. We are given that the total mass of the products is 0.1% less than that of the original uranium-235 atom.\n\nMass difference = 0.1% of uranium-235 mass\n\nThe mass of one uranium-235 atom can be calculated using its atomic mass (235.0439299 u) and the conversion factor between atomic mass units (u) and kilograms (1 u = 1.66053906660 × 10^-27 kg).\n\nMass of uranium-235 atom (kg) = 235.0439299 u × 1.66053906660 × 10^-27 kg/u ≈ 3.9037145 × 10^-25 kg\n\nNow, we can find the mass difference:\n\nMass difference (kg) = 0.1% × 3.9037145 × 10^-25 kg ≈ 3.9037145 × 10^-27 kg\n\nNext, we can use Einstein's equation to calculate the energy release:\n\nE = mc^2\n\nwhere\nm = 3.9037145 × 10^-27 kg (mass difference)\nc = 2.99792458 × 10^8 m/s (speed of light)\n\nE = (3.9037145 × 10^-27 kg) × (2.99792458 × 10^8 m/s)^2 ≈ 3.520 × 10^-11 Joules\n\nTherefore, the energy release when one atom of uranium-235 undergoes nuclear fission is approximately 3.520 × 10^-11 Joules."
