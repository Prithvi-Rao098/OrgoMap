    "message_1": "What is the solubility of Calcium chloride (CaCl2) in water (H2O) at a temperature of 25째C? Provide the calculations used to determine the solubility.",
    "message_2": "The solubility of a substance is typically given in grams of solute per 100 grams of solvent (g/100g). For calcium chloride (CaCl2) in water at 25째C, the solubility is approximately 74.5 g/100g of water. This value can be found in solubility tables or charts.\n\nTo determine the solubility of CaCl2 in a specific amount of water, you can use the following calculation:\n\nSolubility (g) = (Solubility in g/100g) * (Amount of water in grams) / 100\n\nFor example, if you want to find the solubility of CaCl2 in 500 grams of water at 25째C:\n\nSolubility (g) = (74.5 g/100g) * (500g) / 100\nSolubility (g) = 372.5 g\n\nSo, 372.5 grams of CaCl2 can dissolve in 500 grams of water at 25째C."
