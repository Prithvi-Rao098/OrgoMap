    "message_2": "The type of intermolecular forces present in acetone (CH3COCH3) is dipole-dipole interactions. This particular type of intermolecular force is present in acetone because the molecule has a polar nature due to the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in its structure.\n\nIn acetone, the oxygen atom in the carbonyl group is more electronegative than the carbon atom, which results in a polar bond with an uneven distribution of electron density. This creates a partial negative charge on the oxygen atom and a partial positive charge on the carbon atom. The presence of these partial charges leads to the formation of dipole-dipole interactions between the acetone molecules, as the partially positive carbon atom of one molecule is attracted to the partially negative oxygen atom of a neighboring molecule. These dipole-dipole interactions are responsible for the intermolecular forces in acetone."
