    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change of the dissolution of 5 grams of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in 100 mL of water, we first need to determine the number of moles of NaOH in 5 grams.\n\nThe molar mass of NaOH is:\nNa = 22.99 g/mol\nO = 16.00 g/mol\nH = 1.01 g/mol\nTotal = 22.99 + 16.00 + 1.01 = 40.00 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the number of moles of NaOH in 5 grams:\nmoles = mass / molar mass\nmoles = 5 g / 40.00 g/mol = 0.125 mol\n\nNext, we can use the molar enthalpy of dissolution to find the enthalpy change for the dissolution of 0.125 mol of NaOH. The molar enthalpy of dissolution is -44 kJ/mol, which means that -44 kJ of energy is released per mole of NaOH dissolved.\n\nEnthalpy change = moles × molar enthalpy of dissolution\nEnthalpy change = 0.125 mol × -44 kJ/mol = -5.5 kJ\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy change of the dissolution of 5 grams of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in 100 mL of water is -5.5 kJ."
