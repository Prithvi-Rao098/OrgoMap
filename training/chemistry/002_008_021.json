    "message_2": "To find the percent composition by mass of chloride in a sample of calcium chloride, we need to determine the mass of chloride in the sample and then divide it by the total mass of the sample.\n\nFirst, we need to find the molar mass of calcium chloride (CaCl2). The molar mass of calcium (Ca) is 40.08 g/mol, and the molar mass of chloride (Cl) is 35.45 g/mol. Since there are two chloride atoms in calcium chloride, we need to multiply the molar mass of chloride by 2:\n\nMolar mass of CaCl2 = (40.08 g/mol) + 2 * (35.45 g/mol) = 40.08 + 70.90 = 110.98 g/mol\n\nNow, we need to find the mass of chloride in the 15.00 grams sample of calcium chloride. To do this, we'll use the ratio of the mass of chloride in one mole of CaCl2 to the molar mass of CaCl2:\n\nMass of chloride in the sample = (Mass of Cl2 in CaCl2 / Molar mass of CaCl2) * Mass of the sample\nMass of chloride in the sample = (70.90 g/mol / 110.98 g/mol) * 15.00 g = 0.6389 * 15.00 g = 9.58 g\n\nFinally, we can find the percent composition by mass of chloride in the sample by dividing the mass of chloride by the total mass of the sample and multiplying by 100:\n\nPercent composition of chloride = (Mass of chloride in the sample / Total mass of the sample) * 100\nPercent composition of chloride = (9.58 g / 15.00 g) * 100 = 63.89 %\n\nRounded to two decimal places, the percent composition by mass of chloride in the sample of calcium chloride is 63.89%."
