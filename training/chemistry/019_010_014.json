    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of ethane, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH° = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants)\n\nFor the products, we have 2 moles of CO2 and 3 moles of H2O:\n\nΣ ΔHf°(products) = (2 × -393.5 kJ/mol) + (3 × -285.8 kJ/mol) = -787.0 kJ/mol - 857.4 kJ/mol = -1644.4 kJ/mol\n\nFor the reactants, we have 1 mole of C2H6 and 3.5 moles of O2. Since the standard enthalpy of formation for O2 is zero (it is an element in its standard state), we only need to consider the enthalpy of formation for C2H6:\n\nΣ ΔHf°(reactants) = (-84.7 kJ/mol) + (3.5 × 0 kJ/mol) = -84.7 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard enthalpy change:\n\nΔH° = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants) = -1644.4 kJ/mol - (-84.7 kJ/mol) = -1559.7 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the combustion of ethane is -1559.7 kJ/mol."
