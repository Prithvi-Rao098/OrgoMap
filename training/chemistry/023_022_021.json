    "message_2": "To prepare 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid from benzoic acid and nitric acid with a high yield, you can follow these reaction conditions:\n\n1. Reagents:\n   - Benzoic acid (1 equivalent)\n   - Concentrated nitric acid (HNO3, approximately 3-4 equivalents)\n   - Concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4, approximately 1-2 equivalents)\n\n2. Procedure:\n   - In a round-bottom flask, add benzoic acid and concentrated sulfuric acid. Stir the mixture until benzoic acid is dissolved.\n   - Cool the mixture in an ice bath to maintain a low temperature (0-5°C).\n   - Slowly add concentrated nitric acid dropwise to the cooled mixture while stirring. Make sure to maintain the low temperature throughout the addition.\n   - After the addition is complete, remove the ice bath and let the reaction mixture warm up to room temperature.\n   - Stir the reaction mixture at room temperature for 3-4 hours.\n   - Pour the reaction mixture onto crushed ice and neutralize it with a sodium bicarbonate solution (NaHCO3) until effervescence ceases.\n   - Filter the precipitated 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid and wash it with cold water.\n   - Recrystallize the product from a suitable solvent (e.g., hot water or ethanol) to obtain pure 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid.\n\n3. Reaction conditions:\n   - Temperature: Start at 0-5°C during the addition of nitric acid, then let it warm up to room temperature (20-25°C) for the remainder of the reaction.\n   - Reaction time: Approximately 3-4 hours at room temperature after the addition of nitric acid is complete.\n\nPlease note that this reaction involves the use of concentrated acids, which are highly corrosive and can cause severe burns. Make sure to follow proper safety precautions, such as wearing gloves, goggles, and a lab coat, and work in a well-ventilated area or a fume hood."
