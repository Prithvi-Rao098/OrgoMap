    "message_1": "What is the absorbed dose of a patient undergoing radiation therapy using a cobalt-60 source that emits gamma rays with an energy of 1.33 MeV, given that the patient receives a total of 6000 J of energy from the source? (Assume that all energy deposited in the patient's body is absorbed and that the cobalt-60 emits gamma rays uniformly in all directions.)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the absorbed dose, we need to know the mass of the patient's body where the radiation is being absorbed. The absorbed dose is defined as the energy deposited per unit mass, and it is measured in Gray (Gy), where 1 Gy = 1 J/kg.\n\nLet's assume the mass of the patient's body where the radiation is being absorbed is m kg. Given that the patient receives a total of 6000 J of energy from the source, we can calculate the absorbed dose (D) using the following formula:\n\nD = Energy deposited / Mass\nD = 6000 J / m kg\n\nWithout knowing the mass (m) of the patient's body where the radiation is being absorbed, we cannot provide a specific numerical value for the absorbed dose. However, the formula above can be used to calculate the absorbed dose once the mass is known."
