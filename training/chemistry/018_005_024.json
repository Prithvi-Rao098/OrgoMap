    "message_2": "The effect of changing the concentration of reactants on the reaction rate for the reaction between hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3) solution can be explained using the collision theory. According to this theory, the reaction rate depends on the frequency of effective collisions between the reacting particles.\n\nThe reaction between hydrochloric acid and sodium thiosulfate is as follows:\n\n2HCl(aq) + Na2S2O3(aq) â†’ 2NaCl(aq) + H2O(l) + SO2(g) + S(s)\n\nWhen the concentration of either hydrochloric acid or sodium thiosulfate is increased, the number of particles of that reactant in the solution also increases. This results in a higher probability of effective collisions between the reactant particles, leading to an increase in the reaction rate.\n\nIn summary, increasing the concentration of either hydrochloric acid or sodium thiosulfate in the reaction will lead to an increase in the reaction rate. Conversely, decreasing the concentration of either reactant will result in a decrease in the reaction rate."
