    "message_1": "How does the addition of a catalyst affect the equilibrium concentration of reactants and products in the reaction N2O4 (g) ⇌ 2NO2 (g)? Assume that the initial concentrations of N2O4 and NO2 are 0.1M and that the catalyst is added to the system at equilibrium. Calculate the new equilibrium concentrations of N2O4 and NO2 after the addition of the catalyst.",
    "message_2": "The addition of a catalyst to a chemical reaction does not affect the equilibrium concentrations of reactants and products. A catalyst works by lowering the activation energy of the reaction, which speeds up the rate at which the reaction reaches equilibrium. However, the catalyst does not change the position of the equilibrium itself.\n\nIn the reaction N2O4 (g) ⇌ 2NO2 (g), if the initial concentrations of N2O4 and NO2 are both 0.1M and the system is already at equilibrium, the addition of a catalyst will not change the equilibrium concentrations of N2O4 and NO2. Therefore, the new equilibrium concentrations of N2O4 and NO2 after the addition of the catalyst will still be 0.1M each."
