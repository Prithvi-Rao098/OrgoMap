    "message_2": "To calculate the heat of hydration, we first need to determine the number of moles of calcium chloride (CaCl2) in 50 grams.\n\nThe molar mass of CaCl2 is:\nCa = 40.08 g/mol\nCl = 35.45 g/mol (and there are 2 Cl atoms)\n\nSo, the molar mass of CaCl2 = 40.08 + (2 × 35.45) = 40.08 + 70.9 = 110.98 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the number of moles of CaCl2 in 50 grams:\nmoles = mass / molar mass = 50 g / 110.98 g/mol ≈ 0.4505 mol\n\nNow that we have the number of moles, we can calculate the heat of hydration using the molar heat of hydration:\n\nHeat of hydration = moles × molar heat of hydration\nHeat of hydration = 0.4505 mol × (-81 kJ/mol) ≈ -36.5 kJ\n\nSo, the heat of hydration when 50 grams of anhydrous calcium chloride is mixed with 100 mL of water is approximately -36.5 kJ."
