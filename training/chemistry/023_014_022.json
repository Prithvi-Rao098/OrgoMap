    "message_2": "To calculate the yield percentage of 4-bromoacetanilide, we first need to determine the theoretical yield of the product based on the limiting reactant, which in this case is acetanilide.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nC8H9NO + Br2 â†’ C8H8BrNO + HBr\n\nFirst, we need to find the molar mass of acetanilide and 4-bromoacetanilide.\n\nAcetanilide (C8H9NO):\nC: 12.01 g/mol * 8 = 96.08 g/mol\nH: 1.01 g/mol * 9 = 9.09 g/mol\nN: 14.01 g/mol * 1 = 14.01 g/mol\nO: 16.00 g/mol * 1 = 16.00 g/mol\nTotal molar mass = 96.08 + 9.09 + 14.01 + 16.00 = 135.18 g/mol\n\n4-Bromoacetanilide (C8H8BrNO):\nC: 12.01 g/mol * 8 = 96.08 g/mol\nH: 1.01 g/mol * 8 = 8.08 g/mol\nBr: 79.90 g/mol * 1 = 79.90 g/mol\nN: 14.01 g/mol * 1 = 14.01 g/mol\nO: 16.00 g/mol * 1 = 16.00 g/mol\nTotal molar mass = 96.08 + 8.08 + 79.90 + 14.01 + 16.00 = 214.07 g/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the moles of acetanilide in the 5-gram sample:\n\nmoles of acetanilide = mass / molar mass\nmoles of acetanilide = 5 g / 135.18 g/mol = 0.0370 mol\n\nSince the reaction has a 1:1 stoichiometry between acetanilide and 4-bromoacetanilide, the moles of 4-bromoacetanilide produced will also be 0.0370 mol.\n\nNow, we can calculate the theoretical mass of 4-bromoacetanilide produced:\n\nmass of 4-bromoacetanilide = moles * molar mass\nmass of 4-bromoacetanilide = 0.0370 mol * 214.07 g/mol = 7.9206 g\n\nAssuming all reactants are consumed and no side reactions occur, the actual yield will be equal to the theoretical yield. Therefore, the yield percentage of 4-bromoacetanilide is:\n\nyield percentage = (actual yield / theoretical yield) * 100\nyield percentage = (7.9206 g / 7.9206 g) * 100 = 100%"
