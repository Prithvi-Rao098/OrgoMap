    "message_2": "In the molecule of ethene (C2H4), the type of hybrid orbitals present are sp2 hybrid orbitals. Each carbon atom in ethene forms three sigma bonds, one with another carbon atom and two with hydrogen atoms. To accommodate these three sigma bonds, the carbon atom undergoes sp2 hybridization, which involves the mixing of one s orbital and two p orbitals to form three sp2 hybrid orbitals. These sp2 hybrid orbitals form a trigonal planar arrangement around each carbon atom. Additionally, there is a pi bond between the two carbon atoms, which is formed by the overlap of the remaining unhybridized p orbitals."
