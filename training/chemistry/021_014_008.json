    "message_2": "The VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) geometry of a carbon dioxide (CO2) molecule is linear. In CO2, the central carbon atom is bonded to two oxygen atoms through double bonds. There are no lone pairs on the central carbon atom, so the electron groups around the carbon atom are only the two double bonds. These electron groups repel each other and arrange themselves to be as far apart as possible, resulting in a linear geometry with a bond angle of 180 degrees."
