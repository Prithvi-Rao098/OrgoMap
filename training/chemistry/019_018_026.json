    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the phase transition reaction of solid calcium carbonate (CaCO3) to gaseous carbon dioxide (CO2) at 298 K, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH°(reaction) = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants)\n\nThe reaction is: CaCO3(s) → CaO(s) + CO2(g)\n\nFirst, we need to find the formation enthalpy of CaO. We can do this using the given formation enthalpies for CaCO3 and CO2:\n\nΔHf°(CaCO3) = ΔHf°(CaO) + ΔHf°(CO2)\n\n-1206.9 kJ/mol = ΔHf°(CaO) - 393.5 kJ/mol\n\nΔHf°(CaO) = -1206.9 kJ/mol + 393.5 kJ/mol = -813.4 kJ/mol\n\nNow we can calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nΔH°(reaction) = [ΔHf°(CaO) + ΔHf°(CO2)] - ΔHf°(CaCO3)\n\nΔH°(reaction) = [(-813.4 kJ/mol) + (-393.5 kJ/mol)] - (-1206.9 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH°(reaction) = -1206.9 kJ/mol + 1206.9 kJ/mol\n\nΔH°(reaction) = 0 kJ/mol\n\nSince the standard enthalpy change for the reaction is 0 kJ/mol, the phase transition reaction of solid calcium carbonate to gaseous carbon dioxide at 298 K is thermodynamically neutral. The specific heat capacities of CaCO3 and CO2 are not needed for this calculation, as they would be used to calculate the heat absorbed or released during a temperature change, not a phase transition."
