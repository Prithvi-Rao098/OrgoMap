    "message_2": "To find the concentration of the sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution, we can use the concept of stoichiometry and the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between NaOH and HCl:\n\nNaOH + HCl → NaCl + H2O\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that the mole ratio between NaOH and HCl is 1:1.\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of HCl in the 35.0 mL of 0.10 M solution:\n\nmoles of HCl = volume (L) × concentration (M)\nmoles of HCl = 0.035 L × 0.10 M = 0.0035 moles\n\nSince the mole ratio between NaOH and HCl is 1:1, the moles of NaOH that reacted with HCl are also 0.0035 moles.\n\nNow, we can find the concentration of the NaOH solution:\n\nconcentration (M) = moles of NaOH / volume (L)\nconcentration (M) = 0.0035 moles / 0.025 L = 0.14 M\n\nSo, the concentration of the sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution is 0.14 M."
