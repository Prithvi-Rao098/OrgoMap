    "message_2": "Uranium-238 (238U) undergoes alpha decay to form Thorium-234 (234Th). In alpha decay, the nucleus emits an alpha particle, which consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons (essentially a helium-4 nucleus, 4He). The resulting nuclide and the alpha particle are the products of the decay process. The decay equation can be written as:\n\n238U â†’ 234Th + 4He\n\nIn terms of energy released, the alpha decay of 238U has an energy of approximately 4.27 MeV (million electron volts). This energy is carried away by the emitted alpha particle and is also responsible for the recoil of the resulting 234Th nucleus."
