    "message_2": "The citric acid cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle or the tricarboxylic acid cycle, is a series of chemical reactions that generate energy through the oxidation of acetyl-CoA derived from carbohydrates, fats, and proteins into carbon dioxide and chemical energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The cycle occurs in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells.\n\nPer turn of the citric acid cycle, the following high-energy molecules are produced:\n\n- 1 ATP (via substrate-level phosphorylation)\n- 3 NADH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide)\n- 1 FADH2 (reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide)\n\nThe NADH and FADH2 molecules produced in the citric acid cycle are used in oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP. In the electron transport chain, NADH generates approximately 2.5 ATP molecules per NADH, while FADH2 generates approximately 1.5 ATP molecules per FADH2.\n\nThus, per turn of the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, the total ATP production is as follows:\n\n- 1 ATP (from substrate-level phosphorylation)\n- 3 NADH × 2.5 ATP/NADH = 7.5 ATP\n- 1 FADH2 × 1.5 ATP/FADH2 = 1.5 ATP\n\nTotal ATP production per turn of the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation is approximately 10 ATP molecules. However, it's important to note that the actual ATP yield may vary slightly depending on the efficiency of the electron transport chain and the specific cell type."
