    "message_2": "To determine the minimum amount of nitric acid required to prepare 10 grams of 2,4-dinitrophenol from phenol, we need to consider the balanced chemical equation for the reaction and the molecular weights of the compounds involved.\n\nThe reaction is as follows:\n\nC6H5OH (phenol) + 2 HNO3 (nitric acid) → C6H3N2O5 (2,4-dinitrophenol) + 2 H2O (water)\n\nFirst, let's find the molecular weights of the compounds:\n\nPhenol (C6H5OH): (6 × 12.01) + (6 × 1.01) + 16.00 = 94.11 g/mol\nNitric acid (HNO3): 1.01 + 14.01 + (3 × 16.00) = 63.01 g/mol\n2,4-Dinitrophenol (C6H3N2O5): (6 × 12.01) + (3 × 1.01) + (2 × 14.01) + (5 × 16.00) = 184.11 g/mol\n\nNow, we need to determine the moles of 2,4-dinitrophenol required:\n\n10 g of 2,4-dinitrophenol × (1 mol / 184.11 g) = 0.0543 mol\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:2 for phenol to nitric acid, we need twice the number of moles of nitric acid:\n\n0.0543 mol of 2,4-dinitrophenol × (2 mol of nitric acid / 1 mol of 2,4-dinitrophenol) = 0.1086 mol of nitric acid\n\nNow, we can find the mass of nitric acid required:\n\n0.1086 mol of nitric acid × (63.01 g / mol) = 6.84 g\n\nTherefore, the minimum amount of nitric acid required to prepare 10 grams of 2,4-dinitrophenol from phenol, assuming a 100% yield and all reactions proceed to completion, is 6.84 grams."
