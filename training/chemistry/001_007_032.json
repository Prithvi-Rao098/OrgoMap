    "message_2": "In benzene (C6H6), each carbon atom is bonded to two other carbon atoms and one hydrogen atom. The hybridization state of the carbon atoms in benzene is sp2.\n\nIn sp2 hybridization, one s orbital and two p orbitals of the carbon atom mix to form three new sp2 hybrid orbitals. These sp2 hybrid orbitals are arranged in a trigonal planar geometry, with bond angles of approximately 120 degrees. Each carbon atom in benzene forms three sigma (σ) bonds: one with a hydrogen atom and two with adjacent carbon atoms.\n\nThe remaining unhybridized p orbital on each carbon atom is perpendicular to the plane of the molecule and overlaps with the p orbitals of the adjacent carbon atoms. This overlap forms six pi (π) bonds, which are delocalized over the entire benzene ring. This delocalization of electrons is known as resonance or aromaticity, and it contributes significantly to the stability of the benzene molecule.\n\nThe stability of benzene due to its aromaticity can be observed in its resistance to reactions that would typically break double bonds in other molecules. This stability is also reflected in its heat of hydrogenation, which is lower than expected for a molecule with three isolated double bonds. Overall, the sp2 hybridization and the delocalization of π electrons in benzene contribute to its unique stability and chemical properties."
