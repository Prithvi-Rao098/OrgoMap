Assume all reactants and products are in their standard states.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of reduction for the given reaction, we can use the following formula:\n\nΔH(reaction) = Σ ΔHf(products) - Σ ΔHf(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH(reaction) is the enthalpy of reduction, ΔHf(products) is the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of the products, and ΔHf(reactants) is the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of the reactants.\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\nFe2O3(s) + 3CO(g) → 2Fe(s) + 3CO2(g)\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation of Fe(s) is 0 kJ/mol since it is in its elemental form.\n\nNow, let's calculate the enthalpy of formation for the products and reactants:\n\nΣ ΔHf(products) = (2 × 0 kJ/mol) + (3 × -393.5 kJ/mol) = -1180.5 kJ/mol\n\nΣ ΔHf(reactants) = (-824 kJ/mol) + (3 × -110.5 kJ/mol) = -1155.5 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy of reduction:\n\nΔH(reaction) = Σ ΔHf(products) - Σ ΔHf(reactants) = -1180.5 kJ/mol - (-1155.5 kJ/mol) = -25 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy of reduction for the given reaction is -25 kJ/mol."
