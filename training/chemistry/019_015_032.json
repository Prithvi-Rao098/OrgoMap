    "message_2": "The fusion reaction of hydrogen atoms to form helium atoms is known as nuclear fusion, which occurs in the core of the Sun and other stars. In this process, four hydrogen nuclei (protons) combine to form one helium nucleus (two protons and two neutrons) with the release of a large amount of energy. The overall reaction can be represented as:\n\n4 H-1 (4 protons) → He-4 (2 protons + 2 neutrons) + 2 e+ + 2 ν_e + energy\n\nHere, e+ represents a positron, and ν_e represents an electron neutrino.\n\nTo calculate the standard enthalpy change for this reaction, we need to consider the mass difference between the reactants and products, which is converted into energy according to Einstein's famous equation, E=mc².\n\nMass of 4 H-1 atoms = 4 × 1.007825 amu = 4.0313 amu\nMass of 1 He-4 atom = 4.001506 amu\n\nMass difference (Δm) = 4.0313 amu - 4.001506 amu = 0.029794 amu\n\nTo convert the mass difference into energy, we need to convert amu (atomic mass units) to kg and then use the E=mc² equation.\n\n1 amu = 1.66054 × 10^(-27) kg\n\nΔm = 0.029794 amu × 1.66054 × 10^(-27) kg/amu = 4.9509 × 10^(-29) kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy released using E=mc²:\n\nE = (4.9509 × 10^(-29) kg) × (3.00 × 10^8 m/s)²\nE = 4.4558 × 10^(-12) J\n\nSince this is the energy released for one reaction, we need to find the energy per mole of reactions. There are 6.022 × 10^23 particles in one mole, so:\n\nEnergy per mole = 4.4558 × 10^(-12) J × 6.022 × 10^23\nEnergy per mole = 2.681 × 10^12 J/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the fusion reaction of hydrogen atoms to form helium atoms is approximately +2.681 × 10^12 J/mol. The positive sign indicates that the reaction is exothermic, meaning it releases energy."
