    "message_2": "When solid magnesium nitrate (Mg(NO₃)₂) decomposes upon heating, it forms magnesium oxide (MgO), nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), and oxygen (O₂) as the decomposition products. The balanced chemical equation for this decomposition reaction is:\n\n2 Mg(NO₃)₂ (s) → 2 MgO (s) + 4 NO₂ (g) + O₂ (g)"
