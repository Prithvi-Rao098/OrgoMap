    "message_2": "Acetanilide can be converted into 4-bromoacetanilide using bromine as a reagent through a process called electrophilic aromatic substitution. In this reaction, bromine acts as an electrophile, and acetanilide acts as a nucleophile. The mechanism of this chemical synthesis reaction involves the following steps:\n\n1. Formation of the electrophile: Bromine (Br2) reacts with a Lewis acid catalyst, such as aluminum bromide (AlBr3) or iron(III) bromide (FeBr3), to form a highly electrophilic bromonium ion (Br+).\n\n   Br2 + AlBr3 → Br+ + AlBr4-\n\n2. Attack of the nucleophile: The aromatic ring of acetanilide acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic bromonium ion (Br+), forming a sigma complex (also known as an arenium ion). This step results in the temporary loss of aromaticity.\n\n3. Deprotonation: A base, which could be the AlBr4- or another molecule of acetanilide, abstracts a proton from the sigma complex, restoring the aromaticity of the ring and forming 4-bromoacetanilide.\n\n4. Regeneration of the catalyst: The Lewis acid catalyst is regenerated in the process, allowing it to be used again in the reaction.\n\n   HAlBr4- → AlBr3 + HBr\n\nOverall, the reaction can be represented as:\n\n   Acetanilide + Br2 → 4-Bromoacetanilide + HBr\n\nIt is important to note that the amide functional group in acetanilide is a meta-directing group, meaning it directs the electrophilic substitution to the meta position. However, the reaction can still occur at the para position (4-bromoacetanilide) due to the steric hindrance at the ortho positions. To increase the selectivity for the para product, the reaction can be carried out at low temperatures and with a slight excess of bromine."
