    "message_2": "When Carbon-14 undergoes beta decay, it emits a beta particle (an electron) and an antineutrino. The decay mode is β- decay. The resulting product is Nitrogen-14, as one of the neutrons in the Carbon-14 nucleus is converted into a proton. The equation for this decay process is:\n\n¹⁴C → ¹⁴N + β⁻ + ν̅e"
