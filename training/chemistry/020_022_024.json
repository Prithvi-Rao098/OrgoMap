    "message_2": "To find the new equilibrium constant, we first need to write the expression for the equilibrium constant (K) for the given reaction:\n\nK = [Fe3+]^2 * [OH-]^2 / ([Fe2+]^2 * [H2O2])\n\nNow, let's consider the changes in the concentrations of the reactants and products:\n\n- The concentration of Fe2+ is halved, so the new concentration is 0.5[Fe2+].\n- The concentration of H2O2 is doubled, so the new concentration is 2[H2O2].\n\nWe assume that the concentrations of Fe3+ and OH- remain the same at equilibrium. Now, we can write the expression for the new equilibrium constant (K'):\n\nK' = [Fe3+]^2 * [OH-]^2 / ((0.5[Fe2+])^2 * (2[H2O2]))\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\nK' = [Fe3+]^2 * [OH-]^2 / (0.25[Fe2+]^2 * 2[H2O2])\n\nNow, we can relate K and K' using the original expression for K:\n\nK' = 4 * K / 2\n\nK' = 2 * K\n\nSo, the new equilibrium constant (K') is twice the original equilibrium constant (K)."
