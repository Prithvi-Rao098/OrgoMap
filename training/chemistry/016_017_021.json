    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the formula:\n\nΔH_reaction = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nFor the products, we have 2 moles of CO2, and for the reactants, we have 2 moles of CO and 1 mole of O2.\n\nΔH_reaction = [2 × (-393.5 kJ/mol)] - [2 × (-110.5 kJ/mol) + 1 × (0 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH_reaction = (-787 kJ) - (-221 kJ)\n\nΔH_reaction = -566 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change for the reaction is -566 kJ."
