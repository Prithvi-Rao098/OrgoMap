    "message_2": "The standard electrode potential for the reduction of Ag+ ions to Ag(s) at a temperature of 25°C is +0.80 V. This value is already given for the Ag+/Ag half-cell, and since the standard hydrogen electrode has a potential of 0.00 V, there is no need to adjust the value. The standard electrode potential for the reduction of Ag+ ions to Ag(s) remains +0.80 V."
