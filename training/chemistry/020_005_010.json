    "message_2": "Adding more reactant or product to a chemical reaction affects the equilibrium position according to Le Chatelier's principle. Le Chatelier's principle states that if a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in concentration, temperature, or pressure, the system will adjust its equilibrium position to counteract the change.\n\nHere are three examples to illustrate this principle:\n\n1. Example 1: The Haber process\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g)\n\nIn the Haber process, nitrogen gas reacts with hydrogen gas to form ammonia gas. If we increase the concentration of nitrogen gas (N2) or hydrogen gas (H2), the equilibrium will shift to the right to produce more ammonia gas (NH3) to counteract the change. Conversely, if we increase the concentration of ammonia gas (NH3), the equilibrium will shift to the left to produce more nitrogen gas (N2) and hydrogen gas (H2).\n\n2. Example 2: The esterification reaction\nCH3COOH(aq) + CH3OH(aq) ⇌ CH3COOCH3(aq) + H2O(l)\n\nIn the esterification reaction, acetic acid reacts with methanol to form methyl acetate and water. If we increase the concentration of acetic acid (CH3COOH) or methanol (CH3OH), the equilibrium will shift to the right to produce more methyl acetate (CH3COOCH3) and water (H2O). On the other hand, if we increase the concentration of methyl acetate (CH3COOCH3) or water (H2O), the equilibrium will shift to the left to produce more acetic acid (CH3COOH) and methanol (CH3OH).\n\n3. Example 3: The decomposition of dinitrogen tetroxide\n2N2O4(g) ⇌ 4NO2(g)\n\nIn this reaction, dinitrogen tetroxide decomposes into nitrogen dioxide. If we increase the concentration of dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4), the equilibrium will shift to the right to produce more nitrogen dioxide (NO2) to counteract the change. Conversely, if we increase the concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), the equilibrium will shift to the left to produce more dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4).\n\nIn summary, adding more reactant or product to a chemical reaction affects the equilibrium position according to Le Chatelier's principle. The system will adjust its equilibrium position to counteract the change in concentration, either by shifting to the right (toward the products) or to the left (toward the reactants)."
