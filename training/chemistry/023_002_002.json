    "message_2": "To prepare 10 grams of benzocaine with a purity of at least 95%, we first need to determine the amount of benzocaine and the reactants required.\n\nBenzocaine is synthesized by the esterification of p-aminobenzoic acid with ethanol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst, such as sulfuric acid. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nC7H7NO2 (p-aminobenzoic acid) + C2H5OH (ethanol) â†’ C9H11NO2 (benzocaine) + H2O (water)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the number of moles of benzocaine required to obtain 10 grams of 95% pure benzocaine.\n\nMolar mass of benzocaine (C9H11NO2) = 9(12.01) + 11(1.01) + 1(14.01) + 2(16.00) = 165.19 g/mol\n\nAmount of pure benzocaine required = 10 g * 0.95 = 9.5 g\n\nNumber of moles of benzocaine = 9.5 g / 165.19 g/mol = 0.0575 mol\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, we need an equal number of moles of p-aminobenzoic acid and ethanol.\n\nMolar mass of p-aminobenzoic acid (C7H7NO2) = 7(12.01) + 7(1.01) + 1(14.01) + 2(16.00) = 137.14 g/mol\n\nAmount of p-aminobenzoic acid required = 0.0575 mol * 137.14 g/mol = 7.885 g\n\nMolar mass of ethanol (C2H5OH) = 2(12.01) + 6(1.01) + 1(16.00) = 46.07 g/mol\n\nAmount of ethanol required = 0.0575 mol * 46.07 g/mol = 2.649 g\n\nIn summary, to prepare 10 grams of benzocaine with a purity of at least 95%, you will need 7.885 grams of p-aminobenzoic acid and 2.649 grams of ethanol."
