    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the dissolution of 10 grams of potassium nitrate (KNO3) in 100 grams of water at 25°C, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the number of moles of KNO3.\n2. Multiply the moles of KNO3 by the molar enthalpy of dissolution.\n\nStep 1: Determine the number of moles of KNO3\nThe molar mass of KNO3 = 39.10 g/mol (K) + 14.01 g/mol (N) + 3 * 16.00 g/mol (O) = 101.11 g/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of moles of KNO3:\nmoles = mass / molar mass\nmoles = 10 g / 101.11 g/mol = 0.0989 mol\n\nStep 2: Multiply the moles of KNO3 by the molar enthalpy of dissolution\nEnthalpy change = moles * molar enthalpy of dissolution\nEnthalpy change = 0.0989 mol * (-34.01 kJ/mol) = -3.365 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change for the dissolution of 10 grams of potassium nitrate (KNO3) in 100 grams of water at 25°C is approximately -3.365 kJ."
