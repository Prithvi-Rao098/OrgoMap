    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change when 5 grams of sodium chloride (NaCl) dissolves in 100 mL of water at 25°C, we need to know the enthalpy of solution for NaCl. The enthalpy of solution is the amount of heat absorbed or released when a solute dissolves in a solvent at a constant pressure.\n\nThe enthalpy of solution for NaCl is approximately -3.88 kJ/mol.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of NaCl to moles:\n\n5 g NaCl * (1 mol NaCl / 58.44 g NaCl) = 0.0856 mol NaCl\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change:\n\nΔH = moles * enthalpy of solution\nΔH = 0.0856 mol * -3.88 kJ/mol = -0.332 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change when 5 grams of sodium chloride dissolves in 100 mL of water at 25°C is approximately -0.332 kJ."
