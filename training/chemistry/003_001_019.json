    "message_2": "To determine the maximum amount of work that can be obtained from the combustion of 1 mole of methane gas at 298 K and constant pressure of 1 atm, we need to calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the reaction. The Gibbs free energy change is related to the maximum work that can be obtained from a reaction under constant temperature and pressure conditions.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane is:\n\nCH₄(g) + 2O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l)\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard Gibbs free energy of formation (ΔGf°) for each compound involved in the reaction. The values are as follows:\n\nΔGf°(CH₄) = -50.8 kJ/mol\nΔGf°(O₂) = 0 kJ/mol (since it's an element in its standard state)\nΔGf°(CO₂) = -394.4 kJ/mol\nΔGf°(H₂O) = -237.1 kJ/mol\n\nNext, we can calculate the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) for the reaction using the following equation:\n\nΔG° = Σ [ΔGf°(products)] - Σ [ΔGf°(reactants)]\n\nΔG° = [1(-394.4) + 2(-237.1)] - [1(-50.8) + 2(0)]\n\nΔG° = (-394.4 - 474.2) - (-50.8)\nΔG° = -818.6 kJ/mol\n\nThe negative value of ΔG° indicates that the combustion of methane is a spontaneous reaction under these conditions. The maximum amount of work that can be obtained from the combustion of 1 mole of methane gas at 298 K and constant pressure of 1 atm is 818.6 kJ."
