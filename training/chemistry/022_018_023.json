    "message_2": "Methane (CH4) does not have a carbon-carbon single bond. It consists of one carbon atom bonded to four hydrogen atoms. The bond energy we can calculate is the carbon-hydrogen bond energy in methane.\n\nThe bond energy of a carbon-hydrogen bond in methane is approximately 414 kJ/mol. This is the energy required to break one C-H bond in a methane molecule."
