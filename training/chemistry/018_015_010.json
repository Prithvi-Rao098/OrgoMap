    "message_2": "The reaction rate of a chemical reaction is influenced by several factors, including the concentration of reactants, temperature, presence of a catalyst, and the stoichiometric ratio of the reactants. When the stoichiometric ratio of the reactants is altered, the reaction rate can be affected in different ways depending on the specific reaction and the extent of the change in the ratio.\n\n1. If the stoichiometric ratio is changed such that one of the reactants is present in excess, the reaction rate may increase initially due to the higher concentration of that reactant. However, as the reaction proceeds and the limiting reactant is consumed, the reaction rate will decrease because the concentration of the limiting reactant will be lower.\n\n2. If the stoichiometric ratio is changed such that both reactants are present in their stoichiometric amounts, the reaction rate will be optimal, as both reactants will be consumed at the same rate, and there will be no excess reactant left at the end of the reaction.\n\n3. If the stoichiometric ratio is changed such that both reactants are present in non-optimal amounts (neither in stoichiometric amounts nor in excess), the reaction rate may be slower than in the optimal case. This is because the reaction rate depends on the concentration of both reactants, and if one of them is present in a lower concentration, the reaction rate will be limited by the lower concentration reactant.\n\nIn summary, altering the stoichiometric ratio of the reactants can affect the reaction rate by changing the concentration of the reactants and the availability of the limiting reactant. For the fastest reaction rate, it is generally best to have the reactants in their stoichiometric amounts. However, the specific effect of changing the stoichiometric ratio on the reaction rate will depend on the particular reaction and the extent of the change in the ratio."
