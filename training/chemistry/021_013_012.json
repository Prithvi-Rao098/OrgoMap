    "message_2": "The Lewis structure of carbon dioxide (CO2) consists of a carbon atom (C) double bonded to two oxygen atoms (O). Here's a representation of the structure:\n\nO=C=O\n\nEach oxygen atom forms a double bond with the carbon atom, sharing two pairs of electrons. This results in a total of four electrons being shared between the carbon and each oxygen atom. The remaining four electrons on each oxygen atom form two lone pairs."
