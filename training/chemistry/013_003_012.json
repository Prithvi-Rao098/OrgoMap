The molecular weight of n-octadecane is 284.54 g/mol and its molecular area in the liquid phase is 0.219 nm². Use the Langmuir adsorption isotherm equation to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the area per molecule occupied by a monolayer of n-octadecane molecules adsorbed at the air-water interface, we need to use the Langmuir adsorption isotherm equation:\n\nΠ = (k * A * Γ) / (1 - Γ)\n\nwhere Π is the surface pressure (20 mN/m), k is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10^(-23) J/K), A is the molecular area in the liquid phase (0.219 nm²), and Γ is the surface coverage (fraction of the surface covered by the adsorbed molecules).\n\nFirst, we need to find the value of Γ. Rearrange the Langmuir equation to solve for Γ:\n\nΓ = Π / (k * A + Π)\n\nNow, we need to convert the surface pressure from mN/m to J/m²:\n\nΠ = 20 mN/m * (1 N / 1000 mN) * (1 J / 1 N*m) = 0.02 J/m²\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the equation:\n\nΓ = 0.02 J/m² / (1.38 × 10^(-23) J/K * 0.219 × 10^(-18) m² + 0.02 J/m²)\n\nΓ ≈ 0.02 J/m² / (3.02 × 10^(-22) J/m² + 0.02 J/m²)\n\nΓ ≈ 0.02 J/m² / 0.0200000302 J/m²\n\nΓ ≈ 0.99999849\n\nNow that we have the surface coverage, we can calculate the area per molecule occupied by a monolayer of n-octadecane molecules adsorbed at the air-water interface:\n\nA_adsorbed = A_liquid / (1 - Γ)\n\nA_adsorbed = 0.219 nm² / (1 - 0.99999849)\n\nA_adsorbed ≈ 0.219 nm² / 1.51 × 10^(-6)\n\nA_adsorbed ≈ 145.03 nm²\n\nSo, the area per molecule occupied by a monolayer of n-octadecane molecules adsorbed at the air-water interface is approximately 145.03 nm²."
