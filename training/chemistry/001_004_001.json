    "message_2": "The mechanism of the nucleophilic substitution reaction between an alkyl halide and an amine with the displacement of a halogen ion is called the S_N2 (Substitution Nucleophilic Bimolecular) mechanism. Here's a step-by-step description of the process:\n\n1. The nucleophile, in this case, the amine, approaches the alkyl halide from the side opposite to the leaving group (the halogen ion). This is because the nucleophile is attracted to the partially positive carbon atom bonded to the halogen.\n\n2. As the amine gets closer to the alkyl halide, it forms a partial bond with the electrophilic carbon atom. At the same time, the carbon-halogen bond starts to weaken as the halogen ion begins to leave.\n\n3. The transition state is reached when the amine is partially bonded to the electrophilic carbon, and the carbon-halogen bond is partially broken. In this state, the molecule is highly unstable and has a pentavalent carbon atom.\n\n4. The amine completes the bond formation with the electrophilic carbon, while the halogen ion fully detaches from the carbon atom, becoming a free halide ion.\n\n5. The product is formed, which is a new alkyl amine compound, and the halogen ion is displaced as a leaving group.\n\nIt's important to note that the S_N2 mechanism occurs in a single concerted step, meaning that bond formation and bond breaking happen simultaneously. This reaction is stereospecific, resulting in the inversion of configuration at the electrophilic carbon center (Walden inversion). Factors that favor S_N2 reactions include a good nucleophile (such as an amine), a good leaving group (such as a halogen ion), and a less sterically hindered alkyl halide (methyl or primary alkyl halides)."
