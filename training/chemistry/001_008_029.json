    "message_2": "The major product formed in the dehydration of 1-methylcyclohexanol with concentrated sulfuric acid as a catalyst is 1-methylcyclohexene. This reaction involves the elimination of a water molecule (H2O) from the alcohol, resulting in the formation of a double bond (alkene) in the cyclohexane ring."
