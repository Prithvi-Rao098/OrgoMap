    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy of formation of hexane (C6H14), we can use Hess's Law, which states that the total enthalpy change for a reaction is the sum of the enthalpy changes for each step in the reaction. We can break down the formation of hexane into a series of reactions involving the given compounds.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the balanced equation for the formation of hexane from its elements in their standard states:\n\nC(s) + H2(g) → C6H14(g)\n\nBalancing the equation, we get:\n\n6C(s) + 7H2(g) → C6H14(g)\n\nNow, we can use the given information to create a series of reactions that will lead to the formation of hexane:\n\n1) 3C(s) + 3H2(g) → C3H6(g) (using ΔHf° [C2H4(g)] = +52.3 kJ/mol)\n2) 2C3H6(g) → C6H12(g) (using ΔHf° [C4H10(g)] = -126.7 kJ/mol)\n3) C6H12(g) + H2(g) → C6H14(g) (using ΔHf° [H2O(l)] = -285.8 kJ/mol)\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy changes for each reaction:\n\n1) ΔH1 = 3 * (+52.3 kJ/mol) = +156.9 kJ/mol\n2) ΔH2 = 0.5 * (-126.7 kJ/mol) = -63.35 kJ/mol (since we need to divide by 2 to get the enthalpy change for C6H12)\n3) ΔH3 = -285.8 kJ/mol (since the reaction involves the formation of 1 mole of hexane)\n\nFinally, we can use Hess's Law to find the total enthalpy change for the formation of hexane:\n\nΔHf° [C6H14(g)] = ΔH1 + ΔH2 + ΔH3\nΔHf° [C6H14(g)] = +156.9 kJ/mol - 63.35 kJ/mol - 285.8 kJ/mol\nΔHf° [C6H14(g)] = -192.25 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation of hexane (C6H14) is -192.25 kJ/mol."
