    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction, we can use the expression:\n\nKc = [N2O4] / [NO2]^2\n\nwhere [N2O4] is the equilibrium concentration of N2O4 and [NO2] is the equilibrium concentration of NO2.\n\nGiven the concentrations of N2O4 and NO2, we can plug the values into the expression:\n\nKc = (0.050 M) / (0.015 M)^2\n\nKc = 0.050 / 0.000225\n\nKc ≈ 222.22\n\nThe equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction at 25°C is approximately 222.22."
