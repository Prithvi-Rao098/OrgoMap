    "message_2": "The net ATP production per molecule of glucose during the Citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle) and oxidative phosphorylation in human cells can be broken down into several steps. Here is a detailed explanation of the energy conversion steps that lead to ATP production in these metabolic pathways:\n\n1. Glycolysis: This is the first step in glucose metabolism, where one molecule of glucose (6 carbons) is converted into two molecules of pyruvate (3 carbons each). During this process, 2 ATP molecules are consumed, and 4 ATP molecules are produced, resulting in a net gain of 2 ATP molecules. Additionally, 2 NADH molecules are generated.\n\n2. Pyruvate Decarboxylation: Each pyruvate molecule is converted into an acetyl-CoA molecule, which can enter the Citric acid cycle. During this process, 1 NADH molecule is produced for each pyruvate, resulting in a total of 2 NADH molecules (since there are two pyruvate molecules produced from one glucose molecule).\n\n3. Citric Acid Cycle: Each acetyl-CoA molecule enters the Citric acid cycle, and for each turn of the cycle, the following energy molecules are produced:\n- 1 ATP (by substrate-level phosphorylation)\n- 3 NADH\n- 1 FADH2\n\nSince there are two acetyl-CoA molecules produced from one glucose molecule, the cycle turns twice, resulting in:\n- 2 ATP\n- 6 NADH\n- 2 FADH2\n\n4. Oxidative Phosphorylation: The NADH and FADH2 molecules produced in the previous steps are used in the electron transport chain (ETC) to generate ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. The number of ATP molecules produced per NADH and FADH2 varies slightly depending on the cell type and specific conditions. However, a commonly used estimate is that each NADH produces ~2.5 ATP, and each FADH2 produces ~1.5 ATP.\n\nUsing these estimates, the ATP production from oxidative phosphorylation can be calculated as follows:\n- From Glycolysis: 2 NADH × 2.5 ATP/NADH = 5 ATP\n- From Pyruvate Decarboxylation: 2 NADH × 2.5 ATP/NADH = 5 ATP\n- From Citric Acid Cycle: 6 NADH × 2.5 ATP/NADH = 15 ATP and 2 FADH2 × 1.5 ATP/FADH2 = 3 ATP\n\nAdding up the ATP produced in each step:\n- Glycolysis: 2 ATP (net)\n- Oxidative Phosphorylation: 5 ATP (from glycolysis) + 5 ATP (from pyruvate decarboxylation) + 15 ATP (from Citric acid cycle NADH) + 3 ATP (from Citric acid cycle FADH2) = 28 ATP\n- Citric Acid Cycle: 2 ATP\n\nThe total net ATP production per molecule of glucose during the Citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation in human cells is approximately 30 ATP (2 from glycolysis, 2 from the Citric acid cycle, and 26 from oxidative phosphorylation). It is important to note that these values are not fixed and can vary depending on the specific conditions and cell types."
