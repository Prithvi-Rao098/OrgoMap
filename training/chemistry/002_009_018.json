    "message_2": "To determine the empirical formula of the compound, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Assume that we have 100 grams of the compound. This means we have 29.5 grams of sodium (Na), 41.1 grams of sulfur (S), and 29.4 grams of oxygen (O).\n2. Convert the mass of each element to moles by dividing by their respective atomic masses.\n3. Divide each mole value by the smallest mole value to get the mole ratio.\n4. Round the mole ratio to the nearest whole number to get the empirical formula.\n\nStep 1:\nMass of Na = 29.5 g\nMass of S = 41.1 g\nMass of O = 29.4 g\n\nStep 2:\nMoles of Na = 29.5 g / 22.99 g/mol (atomic mass of Na) = 1.283 moles\nMoles of S = 41.1 g / 32.07 g/mol (atomic mass of S) = 1.281 moles\nMoles of O = 29.4 g / 16.00 g/mol (atomic mass of O) = 1.838 moles\n\nStep 3:\nDivide each mole value by the smallest mole value (1.281 moles):\n\nMole ratio of Na = 1.283 / 1.281 ≈ 1\nMole ratio of S = 1.281 / 1.281 ≈ 1\nMole ratio of O = 1.838 / 1.281 ≈ 1.4\n\nStep 4:\nSince the mole ratio of O is not close to a whole number, we can try multiplying all the mole ratios by a small whole number to see if we can get whole numbers. Let's try multiplying by 2:\n\nMole ratio of Na = 1 * 2 = 2\nMole ratio of S = 1 * 2 = 2\nMole ratio of O = 1.4 * 2 = 2.8 ≈ 3\n\nNow we have whole numbers for the mole ratios. So, the empirical formula of the compound is Na2S2O3."
