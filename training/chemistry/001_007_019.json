    "message_2": "The Friedel-Crafts alkylation reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction in which a benzene ring reacts with an alkyl halide in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, such as aluminum chloride (AlCl3). In this case, the reaction involves benzene and tert-butyl chloride (t-BuCl).\n\nHere is the step-by-step mechanism for the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene with tert-butyl chloride using an aluminum chloride catalyst:\n\n1. Activation of the alkyl halide: The Lewis acid catalyst, AlCl3, coordinates with the halogen atom (chlorine) in the tert-butyl chloride molecule, forming a complex. This interaction polarizes the carbon-chlorine bond, making the carbon atom more electrophilic.\n\nt-BuCl + AlCl3 → t-BuCl···AlCl3\n\n2. Generation of the electrophile: The bond between the carbon and chlorine atoms in the tert-butyl chloride molecule breaks, resulting in the formation of a tert-butyl carbocation (t-Bu+) and an AlCl4- ion.\n\nt-BuCl···AlCl3 → t-Bu+ + AlCl4-\n\n3. Electrophilic attack on benzene: The electrophilic tert-butyl carbocation (t-Bu+) attacks the benzene ring, breaking one of the pi bonds in the aromatic ring. This results in the formation of a non-aromatic, positively charged cyclohexadienyl cation (Wheland intermediate) with the tert-butyl group attached to the ring.\n\nBenzene + t-Bu+ → t-Bu-Cyclohexadienyl cation\n\n4. Deprotonation and regeneration of the catalyst: A base, usually the AlCl4- ion, abstracts a proton from the cyclohexadienyl cation, restoring the aromaticity of the ring and generating the alkylated benzene product (tert-butylbenzene) and regenerating the AlCl3 catalyst.\n\nt-Bu-Cyclohexadienyl cation + AlCl4- → tert-butylbenzene + HCl + AlCl3\n\nOverall, the Friedel-Crafts alkylation reaction of benzene with tert-butyl chloride in the presence of an aluminum chloride catalyst results in the formation of tert-butylbenzene."
