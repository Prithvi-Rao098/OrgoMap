    "message_2": "When copper is added to a solution of silver nitrate, a redox reaction occurs. Copper (Cu) is more reactive than silver (Ag), so it displaces silver from the silver nitrate (AgNO3) solution. The reaction can be represented by the following balanced equation:\n\nCu(s) + 2AgNO3(aq) â†’ Cu(NO3)2(aq) + 2Ag(s)\n\nIn this reaction, copper metal (Cu) reacts with silver nitrate (AgNO3) to form copper nitrate (Cu(NO3)2) in solution and solid silver (Ag) precipitates out. The silver metal appears as a grayish-white deposit on the surface of the copper. This reaction is an example of a single displacement reaction in chemistry."
