    "message_2": "To calculate the zeta potential of a colloidal particle, we can use the following formula:\n\nZeta potential (ζ) = (q * η) / (ε * r)\n\nwhere:\nq = charge of the particle (-3.2 × 10^-19 C)\nη = viscosity of the solution (we don't have this value, but we can assume it's water at room temperature, which has a viscosity of ~8.9 × 10^-4 Pa·s)\nε = dielectric constant of the solution (78.3) multiplied by the vacuum permittivity constant (8.854 × 10^-12 C²/N·m²)\nr = radius of the particle (half of the diameter, so 125 nm or 125 × 10^-9 m)\n\nFirst, let's calculate ε:\nε = 78.3 * 8.854 × 10^-12 C²/N·m² = 6.93 × 10^-10 C²/N·m²\n\nNow, we can calculate the zeta potential:\nζ = (-3.2 × 10^-19 C * 8.9 × 10^-4 Pa·s) / (6.93 × 10^-10 C²/N·m² * 125 × 10^-9 m)\nζ = (-2.848 × 10^-22 C·Pa·s) / (8.66 × 10^-20 C²/N)\n\nζ ≈ -32.9 mV\n\nThe zeta potential of the colloidal particle is approximately -32.9 mV."
