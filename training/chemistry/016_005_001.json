    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat released, we first need to determine the number of moles of ethanol in 2.5 grams.\n\nNumber of moles = mass / molar mass\nNumber of moles = 2.5 g / 46.07 g/mol = 0.0542 mol\n\nNow, we can use the heat of combustion to find the amount of heat released.\n\nHeat released = number of moles × heat of combustion\nHeat released = 0.0542 mol × -1371 kJ/mol = -74.3 kJ\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the heat is released (exothermic reaction). Therefore, the amount of heat released when 2.5 grams of ethanol burns completely in excess oxygen is 74.3 kJ."
