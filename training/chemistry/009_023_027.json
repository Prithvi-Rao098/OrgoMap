    "message_2": "The half-life of Technetium-99m is approximately 6 hours. This property makes it a useful radionuclide for medical imaging and diagnostics because its relatively short half-life allows for rapid decay and clearance from the body, minimizing the patient's exposure to radiation. Additionally, the gamma radiation emitted by Technetium-99m is easily detected by gamma cameras, allowing for high-quality imaging of the distribution of the radiotracer within the body. This combination of a short half-life and effective detection makes Technetium-99m a popular choice for various diagnostic procedures, such as bone scans, heart perfusion studies, and sentinel lymph node mapping."
