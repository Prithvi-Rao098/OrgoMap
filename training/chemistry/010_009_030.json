    "message_1": "Calculate the resistance of an electrochemical cell with a cell potential of 1.5 V and current flow of 0.25 A when the concentration of copper(II) ions in the cathode compartment is 0.25 M and the concentration of zinc ions in the anode compartment is 0.50 M. The cell has two electrodes made of platinum and the temperature is 25°C. (Assume the transfer of electrons and ions is 100% efficient.)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the resistance of the electrochemical cell, we can use Ohm's Law, which states:\n\nV = I × R\n\nWhere V is the cell potential (voltage), I is the current flow, and R is the resistance. We can rearrange the formula to solve for R:\n\nR = V / I\n\nGiven the cell potential (V) is 1.5 V and the current flow (I) is 0.25 A, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nR = 1.5 V / 0.25 A\n\nR = 6 Ω\n\nThe resistance of the electrochemical cell is 6 ohms."
