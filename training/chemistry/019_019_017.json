The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is: \n\nC2H6(g) + 3.5 O2(g) → 2 CO2(g) + 3H2O(g) \n\nGiven that the standard enthalpy of formation for C2H6(g) is -84.68 kJ/mol, CO2(g) is -393.51 kJ/mol, and H2O(g) is -241.82 kJ/mol.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of ethane, we can use the following formula:\n\nΔH_combustion = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH_combustion is the standard enthalpy change for the combustion, ΔH_f(products) is the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of the products, and ΔH_f(reactants) is the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of the reactants.\n\nFor the products, we have 2 moles of CO2(g) and 3 moles of H2O(g):\nΣ ΔH_f(products) = (2 × -393.51 kJ/mol) + (3 × -241.82 kJ/mol) = -787.02 kJ/mol - 725.46 kJ/mol = -1512.48 kJ/mol\n\nFor the reactants, we have 1 mole of C2H6(g) and 3.5 moles of O2(g). The standard enthalpy of formation for O2(g) is 0 kJ/mol since it is in its elemental form:\nΣ ΔH_f(reactants) = (1 × -84.68 kJ/mol) + (3.5 × 0 kJ/mol) = -84.68 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard enthalpy change for the combustion:\nΔH_combustion = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants) = -1512.48 kJ/mol - (-84.68 kJ/mol) = -1427.80 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of ethane (C2H6) gas to form carbon dioxide (CO2) gas and water (H2O) vapor at 298 K and 1 atm is -1427.80 kJ/mol."
