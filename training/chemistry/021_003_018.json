    "message_2": "The bond angle in a water molecule (H2O) is approximately 104.5 degrees. It can be predicted using the VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) theory by following these steps:\n\n1. Determine the central atom: In H2O, the central atom is oxygen (O).\n\n2. Count the number of electron groups (lone pairs and bonding pairs) around the central atom: Oxygen has two lone pairs and two bonding pairs (one with each hydrogen atom), making a total of four electron groups.\n\n3. Determine the electron group geometry: With four electron groups, the electron group geometry is tetrahedral.\n\n4. Determine the molecular geometry: Since there are two bonding pairs and two lone pairs, the molecular geometry is bent (or angular).\n\n5. Predict the bond angle: In a tetrahedral electron group geometry, the ideal bond angle is 109.5 degrees. However, due to the presence of two lone pairs, which repel the bonding pairs more strongly, the bond angle is reduced to approximately 104.5 degrees.\n\nSo, using the VSEPR theory, we can predict that the bond angle in a water molecule is approximately 104.5 degrees."
