    "message_1": "A chemistry student wants to know how the equilibrium of a reaction will be affected by an increase in temperature. The reaction studied is N2(g) + 3H2(g) ↔ 2NH3(g) and has an equilibrium constant (Kc) of 3.5 x 10^-5 at a certain temperature. If the temperature is increased, what will happen to the concentration of NH3 at equilibrium?",
    "message_2": "To determine the effect of temperature on the equilibrium of this reaction, we need to consider the reaction's enthalpy change (ΔH). The given reaction is an exothermic reaction, meaning it releases heat (ΔH < 0) when ammonia (NH3) is formed from nitrogen (N2) and hydrogen (H2).\n\nAccording to Le Chatelier's principle, if a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in temperature, pressure, or concentration of reactants and products, the system will adjust its equilibrium position to counteract the change.\n\nIn this case, when the temperature is increased, the system will try to counteract the change by shifting the equilibrium position to the endothermic side (the side that absorbs heat). For the given reaction, the endothermic side is the reverse reaction (formation of N2 and H2 from NH3).\n\nAs a result, the equilibrium will shift to the left, favoring the formation of N2 and H2. This means that the concentration of NH3 at equilibrium will decrease when the temperature is increased. Additionally, the equilibrium constant (Kc) will also decrease as the reaction shifts to favor the reactants."
