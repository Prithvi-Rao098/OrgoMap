    "message_1": "What is the mass of copper (Cu) deposited on an electrode in 60 minutes when a current of 0.4 A is passed through a solution of copper sulfate (CuSO4) using a copper electrode as the anode? (The atomic mass of copper is 63.55 amu and its charge is +2)",
    "message_2": "To find the mass of copper deposited on the electrode, we can use Faraday's laws of electrolysis. First, we need to determine the total charge passed through the solution. \n\nTotal charge (Q) = Current (I) × Time (t)\nQ = 0.4 A × 60 minutes × 60 seconds/minute\nQ = 0.4 A × 3600 s\nQ = 1440 Coulombs\n\nNow, we can use Faraday's constant (F), which is approximately 96485 Coulombs per mole of electrons, to find the moles of electrons passed through the solution.\n\nMoles of electrons = Total charge (Q) / Faraday's constant (F)\nMoles of electrons = 1440 C / 96485 C/mol\nMoles of electrons = 0.0149 mol\n\nSince copper has a charge of +2, it takes 2 moles of electrons to deposit 1 mole of copper. Therefore, we can find the moles of copper deposited.\n\nMoles of copper = Moles of electrons / 2\nMoles of copper = 0.0149 mol / 2\nMoles of copper = 0.00745 mol\n\nFinally, we can find the mass of copper deposited using the atomic mass of copper (63.55 amu).\n\nMass of copper = Moles of copper × Atomic mass of copper\nMass of copper = 0.00745 mol × 63.55 g/mol\nMass of copper ≈ 0.473 g\n\nSo, the mass of copper deposited on the electrode in 60 minutes is approximately 0.473 grams."
