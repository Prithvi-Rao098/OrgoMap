    "message_2": "Designing a sustainable and eco-friendly process for the extraction and recovery of valuable metals from electronic waste involves several steps. Here's a possible step-by-step process:\n\n1. Collection and sorting of electronic waste:\n   - Collect electronic waste from various sources such as households, businesses, and recycling centers.\n   - Sort the waste based on the type of electronic device, such as computers, mobile phones, and televisions.\n   - Dismantle the devices to separate the components containing valuable metals, such as printed circuit boards (PCBs), connectors, and wires.\n\n2. Size reduction and mechanical separation:\n   - Shred the components into small pieces to increase the surface area for further processing.\n   - Use mechanical separation techniques such as magnetic separation, air classification, and sieving to separate different materials, including metals, plastics, and glass.\n\n3. Pyrolysis:\n   - Heat the shredded components in the absence of oxygen to break down the organic materials, such as plastics and resins, into gases, oil, and char.\n   - The remaining solid residue will contain a higher concentration of metals, making it easier to extract the valuable metals in the subsequent steps.\n\n4. Leaching:\n   - Use eco-friendly leaching agents, such as citric acid, ascorbic acid, or glycine, to dissolve the metals from the solid residue.\n   - Adjust the pH, temperature, and concentration of the leaching agent to optimize the extraction process.\n\n5. Metal recovery:\n   - Use precipitation, solvent extraction, or ion exchange methods to selectively recover the valuable metals from the leachate.\n   - For example, add a precipitating agent to the leachate to selectively precipitate gold, silver, or copper, which can then be filtered and collected.\n   - Alternatively, use a selective solvent or ion exchange resin to extract the target metal ions from the leachate, followed by stripping and recovery of the metal.\n\n6. Purification and refining:\n   - Further purify the recovered metals using electrorefining, pyrometallurgical refining, or hydrometallurgical refining methods, depending on the specific metal and its desired purity level.\n   - For example, use the Wohlwill process (electrorefining) to obtain high-purity gold, or the electrolytic refining process to obtain high-purity copper.\n\n7. Waste treatment and disposal:\n   - Treat the remaining waste materials, such as leachate, sludge, and off-gases, using appropriate methods to minimize environmental impact.\n   - For example, neutralize the acidic leachate with alkaline substances, and treat the off-gases using scrubbers or filters to remove pollutants.\n   - Dispose of the treated waste materials in an environmentally responsible manner, such as landfilling or incineration, following local regulations and guidelines.\n\n8. Recycling and reuse:\n   - Recycle and reuse the recovered metals in the manufacturing of new electronic devices or other applications, thereby reducing the demand for virgin metals and contributing to a circular economy.\n\nBy following these steps, it is possible to design a sustainable and eco-friendly process for the extraction and recovery of valuable metals from electronic waste."
