    "message_2": "To apply the concepts of chemical reactions and stoichiometry to baking a cake, we first need to understand the chemical reaction between baking soda and vinegar. Baking soda is a base (sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO3) and vinegar is an acid (acetic acid, CH3COOH). When they react, they produce carbon dioxide (CO2), water (H2O), and sodium acetate (CH3COONa). The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nNaHCO3 + CH3COOH â†’ CO2 + H2O + CH3COONa\n\nNow, let's say you have a recipe that calls for a certain amount of vinegar, and you want to calculate the amount of baking soda needed to react with it completely to produce the optimal amount of CO2 for a fluffy cake.\n\n1. First, determine the amount of vinegar in the recipe (in moles). To do this, you need to know the volume of vinegar and its concentration (usually given as a percentage on the label). For example, let's say the recipe calls for 10 mL of 5% vinegar. The molar mass of acetic acid is 60.05 g/mol.\n\n(10 mL) * (1 L/1000 mL) * (5 g/100 mL) * (1 mol/60.05 g) = 0.00832 mol CH3COOH\n\n2. Use the stoichiometry of the balanced chemical equation to determine the amount of baking soda needed (in moles). Since the reaction has a 1:1 ratio between acetic acid and sodium bicarbonate, you need the same number of moles of baking soda.\n\n0.00832 mol CH3COOH * (1 mol NaHCO3/1 mol CH3COOH) = 0.00832 mol NaHCO3\n\n3. Convert the amount of baking soda needed from moles to grams. The molar mass of sodium bicarbonate is 84.01 g/mol.\n\n(0.00832 mol NaHCO3) * (84.01 g/mol) = 0.699 g NaHCO3\n\nSo, you would need 0.699 grams of baking soda to react completely with 10 mL of 5% vinegar in the recipe to produce the optimal amount of carbon dioxide for a fluffy cake."
