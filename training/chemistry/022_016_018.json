    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of 5.67 grams of methane, we will first need to determine the number of moles of methane present, and then use the standard enthalpy of combustion to find the total enthalpy change.\n\n1. Calculate the number of moles of methane (CH4):\nMolecular weight of CH4 = 12.01 g/mol (C) + 4 * 1.01 g/mol (H) = 16.05 g/mol\nNumber of moles = mass / molecular weight\nNumber of moles = 5.67 g / 16.05 g/mol = 0.353 moles\n\n2. Calculate the enthalpy change:\nEnthalpy change = number of moles * standard enthalpy of combustion\nEnthalpy change = 0.353 moles * -890.4 kJ/mol = -314.3 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change for the combustion of 5.67 grams of methane is approximately -314.3 kJ."
