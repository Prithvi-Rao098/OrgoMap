    "message_2": "In sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), the central atom is sulfur. To determine the hybridization of the central atom, we need to consider the number of electron domains around it.\n\nSulfur has 6 valence electrons, and each of the six fluorine atoms will share one electron with sulfur to form a single covalent bond. This results in a total of 6 electron domains (6 single bonds) around the sulfur atom.\n\nAccording to the VSEPR theory, the hybridization that corresponds to 6 electron domains is sp3d2. Therefore, the hybridization of the central atom (sulfur) in sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) is sp3d2."
