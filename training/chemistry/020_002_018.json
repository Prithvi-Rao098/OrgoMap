    "message_1": "Sure, here’s an example question:\n\nFor the reaction N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g), if the equilibrium constant (Kc) at 298K is 4.34 x 10^-3, and the initial concentrations of N2 and H2 are each 0.200 M, what are the equilibrium concentrations of all species in the mixture?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to keep track of the concentrations of each species. Let x represent the change in concentration of N2.\n\nInitial concentrations:\n[N2] = 0.200 M\n[H2] = 0.200 M\n[NH3] = 0 M\n\nChange in concentrations:\nΔ[N2] = -x\nΔ[H2] = -3x\nΔ[NH3] = 2x\n\nEquilibrium concentrations:\n[N2] = 0.200 - x\n[H2] = 0.200 - 3x\n[NH3] = 2x\n\nNow, we can use the equilibrium constant expression to set up an equation:\n\nKc = [NH3]^2 / ([N2] * [H2]^3)\n\n4.34 x 10^-3 = (2x)^2 / ((0.200 - x) * (0.200 - 3x)^3)\n\nNow, we need to solve for x. This equation is a bit complicated to solve algebraically, so we can use a numerical method, such as the iterative method or a calculator with a solver function.\n\nUsing a solver, we find that x ≈ 0.0147.\n\nNow, we can plug x back into the equilibrium concentrations:\n\n[N2] = 0.200 - 0.0147 ≈ 0.1853 M\n[H2] = 0.200 - 3(0.0147) ≈ 0.1561 M\n[NH3] = 2(0.0147) ≈ 0.0294 M\n\nSo, the equilibrium concentrations are approximately:\n[N2] = 0.1853 M\n[H2] = 0.1561 M\n[NH3] = 0.0294 M"
