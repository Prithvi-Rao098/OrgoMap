    "message_1": "What is the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction H2(g) + I2(g) â‡Œ 2HI(g) if the initial concentrations of H2 and I2 are both 0.05 M and the final equilibrium concentration of HI is 0.11 M at a certain temperature and pressure?",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction, we first need to determine the change in concentrations of each species during the reaction. Let's denote the change in concentration of H2, I2, and HI as x.\n\nAt equilibrium, the concentration of H2 and I2 will decrease by x, and the concentration of HI will increase by 2x. We know that the final equilibrium concentration of HI is 0.11 M, so we can write:\n\n2x = 0.11\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 0.055\n\nNow, we can find the equilibrium concentrations of H2 and I2:\n\n[H2] = 0.05 - x = 0.05 - 0.055 = -0.005\n[I2] = 0.05 - x = 0.05 - 0.055 = -0.005\n\nSince the concentrations cannot be negative, we can assume that the reaction has gone to completion and the concentrations of H2 and I2 are effectively zero. Therefore, the equilibrium concentrations are:\n\n[H2] = 0\n[I2] = 0\n[HI] = 0.11\n\nNow we can find the equilibrium constant (Kc) using the expression:\n\nKc = [HI]^2 / ([H2] * [I2])\n\nSince [H2] and [I2] are effectively zero, the denominator will be very close to zero, making Kc very large. This indicates that the reaction strongly favors the formation of HI. However, it is important to note that in reality, the concentrations of H2 and I2 would not be exactly zero, but extremely small."
