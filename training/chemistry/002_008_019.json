    "message_2": "To find the percent composition by mass of iron (Fe) in Fe2O3, we need to determine the molar mass of Fe2O3 and the mass of iron in the compound.\n\nFirst, let's find the molar mass of Fe2O3:\n- The molar mass of Fe is 55.845 g/mol.\n- The molar mass of O is 16.00 g/mol.\n\nFe2O3 has 2 moles of Fe and 3 moles of O, so its molar mass is:\n(2 × 55.845 g/mol) + (3 × 16.00 g/mol) = 111.69 g/mol + 48.00 g/mol = 159.69 g/mol\n\nNow, let's find the mass of iron in Fe2O3:\nThere are 2 moles of Fe in Fe2O3, so the mass of iron is:\n2 × 55.845 g/mol = 111.69 g\n\nFinally, let's find the percent composition by mass of iron in Fe2O3:\n(111.69 g / 159.69 g) × 100% = 69.94%\n\nSo, the percent composition by mass of iron (Fe) in Fe2O3 is approximately 69.94%."
