    "message_2": "To determine the amount of hydrogen and oxygen needed to produce 25 grams of water, we can use the balanced chemical equation for the formation of water:\n\n2H2 + O2 → 2H2O\n\nFirst, we need to find the molar mass of water (H2O):\n1 mole of H2O = (2 x 1.008 g/mol for H) + (1 x 16.00 g/mol for O) = 18.016 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find out how many moles of water are in 25 grams:\n25 g H2O × (1 mol H2O / 18.016 g H2O) = 1.387 moles H2O\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 2 moles of H2 react with 1 mole of O2 to produce 2 moles of H2O. Therefore, we need:\n\n1.387 moles H2O × (2 moles H2 / 2 moles H2O) = 1.387 moles H2\n1.387 moles H2O × (1 mole O2 / 2 moles H2O) = 0.6935 moles O2\n\nNow, we can convert moles of H2 and O2 to grams:\n\n1.387 moles H2 × (2.016 g/mol for H2) = 2.796 g H2\n0.6935 moles O2 × (32.00 g/mol for O2) = 22.20 g O2\n\nSo, the student would need 2.796 grams of hydrogen and 22.20 grams of oxygen to produce 25 grams of water."
