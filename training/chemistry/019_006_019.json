    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (K) for the given reaction, we can use the Gibbs free energy equation and the Van't Hoff equation. The Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°rxn) can be calculated using the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°rxn) and the standard entropy change (ΔS°rxn) as follows:\n\nΔG°rxn = ΔH°rxn - TΔS°rxn\n\nwhere T is the temperature in Kelvin (25°C = 298.15 K).\n\nFirst, convert ΔH°rxn and ΔS°rxn to the same units (J/mol):\n\nΔH°rxn = -92.4 kJ/mol × 1000 J/kJ = -92400 J/mol\n\nNow, calculate ΔG°rxn:\n\nΔG°rxn = -92400 J/mol - (298.15 K × -198.1 J/(mol K))\nΔG°rxn = -92400 J/mol + 59134.815 J/mol\nΔG°rxn = -33265.185 J/mol\n\nNext, we can use the Van't Hoff equation to find the equilibrium constant (K):\n\nΔG°rxn = -RT ln(K)\n\nwhere R is the gas constant (8.314 J/(mol K)) and T is the temperature in Kelvin (298.15 K).\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for K:\n\nln(K) = -ΔG°rxn / (RT)\nK = e^(-ΔG°rxn / (RT))\n\nNow, plug in the values:\n\nK = e^(-(-33265.185 J/mol) / (8.314 J/(mol K) × 298.15 K))\nK = e^(33265.185 J/mol / 2475.5041 J/mol)\nK = e^13.43\n\nK ≈ 6.8 × 10^5\n\nThe equilibrium constant (K) for the given reaction at 25°C and 1 atm pressure is approximately 6.8 × 10^5."
