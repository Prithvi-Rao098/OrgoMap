    "message_1": "What is the percentage yield of a chemical reaction if 12 grams of product are obtained when 20 grams of reactant are used and the theoretical yield is 15 grams?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the percentage yield of a chemical reaction, you can use the following formula:\n\nPercentage Yield = (Actual Yield / Theoretical Yield) x 100\n\nIn this case, the actual yield is 12 grams, and the theoretical yield is 15 grams. Plugging these values into the formula:\n\nPercentage Yield = (12 grams / 15 grams) x 100 = 0.8 x 100 = 80%\n\nSo, the percentage yield of the chemical reaction is 80%."
