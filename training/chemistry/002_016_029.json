    "message_2": "To calculate the standard entropy change (ΔS°) for the reaction, we can use the formula:\n\nΔS° = ΣnS°(products) - ΣnS°(reactants)\n\nwhere n is the stoichiometric coefficient and S° is the standard entropy of each species.\n\nFor the given reaction, 2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(g), we have:\n\nΔS° = [2 × S°(H2O(g))] - [2 × S°(H2(g)) + S°(O2(g))]\n\nNow, we can plug in the given standard entropy values:\n\nΔS° = [2 × 188.8 J/mol K] - [2 × 130.6 J/mol K + 205.0 J/mol K]\nΔS° = [377.6 J/mol K] - [466.2 J/mol K]\nΔS° = -88.6 J/mol K\n\nThe standard entropy change for the reaction is -88.6 J/mol K.\n\nTo determine whether the reaction is spontaneous or not at 298 K, we need to calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) using the formula:\n\nΔG = ΔH - TΔS\n\nHowever, we don't have the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the reaction. Instead, we can use the fact that a reaction is spontaneous if ΔG < 0, and the sign of ΔG depends on the signs of ΔH and ΔS.\n\nIn this case, since ΔS is negative, the reaction will be spontaneous if ΔH is also negative and sufficiently large in magnitude to overcome the positive TΔS term. Without the value of ΔH, we cannot definitively determine whether the reaction is spontaneous or not at 298 K."
