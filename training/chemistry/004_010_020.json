    "message_2": "To find the concentration of copper sulfate in the solution, we can use the Beer-Lambert Law, which states:\n\nA = ε * c * l\n\nwhere A is the absorbance, ε is the molar absorptivity, c is the concentration of the solute (in this case, copper sulfate), and l is the path length (in cm) through which the light passes.\n\nWe are given the absorbance (A = 0.332), the molar absorptivity (ε = 8.8 x 10^3 L/(mol cm)), and the wavelength (630 nm, which is not needed in this calculation). We will assume the path length (l) is the standard 1 cm. Now, we can solve for the concentration (c):\n\n0.332 = (8.8 x 10^3 L/(mol cm)) * c * 1 cm\n\nTo isolate c, we can divide both sides of the equation by (8.8 x 10^3 L/(mol cm)):\n\nc = 0.332 / (8.8 x 10^3 L/(mol cm))\n\nc ≈ 3.77 x 10^-5 mol/L\n\nThe concentration of copper sulfate in the solution is approximately 3.77 x 10^-5 mol/L."
