    "message_2": "Ibuprofen is a widely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with the chemical structure of 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionic acid. To propose a viable pathway for its synthesis, we can use retrosynthesis to break down the target molecule into simpler precursors that can be obtained from readily available starting materials.\n\nRetrosynthetic analysis of Ibuprofen:\n\n1. Break the molecule into two parts: the 4-isobutylphenyl group and the propionic acid group. This suggests that we can form Ibuprofen via a Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction between a 4-isobutylbenzene and a propionyl chloride.\n\n2. To synthesize 4-isobutylbenzene, we can perform a Friedel-Crafts alkylation reaction between benzene and isobutyl chloride.\n\n3. To synthesize propionyl chloride, we can treat propionic acid with thionyl chloride (SOCl2).\n\nHere is the proposed synthesis pathway:\n\nStep 1: Synthesis of 4-isobutylbenzene\nStarting materials: Benzene and isobutyl chloride\nReaction: Friedel-Crafts alkylation\nConditions: AlCl3 as a catalyst, anhydrous conditions, room temperature\nProduct: 4-isobutylbenzene\n\nStep 2: Synthesis of propionyl chloride\nStarting materials: Propionic acid and thionyl chloride (SOCl2)\nReaction: Conversion of carboxylic acid to acyl chloride\nConditions: Anhydrous conditions, room temperature\nProduct: Propionyl chloride\n\nStep 3: Synthesis of Ibuprofen\nStarting materials: 4-isobutylbenzene and propionyl chloride\nReaction: Friedel-Crafts acylation\nConditions: AlCl3 as a catalyst, anhydrous conditions, room temperature\nProduct: Ibuprofen\n\nThis synthesis pathway involves three steps and uses readily available starting materials such as benzene, isobutyl chloride, propionic acid, and thionyl chloride."
