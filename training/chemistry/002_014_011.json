    "message_2": "To calculate the formal charge on the nitrogen atom in ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the number of valence electrons for nitrogen in its neutral state.\n2. Determine the number of electrons assigned to nitrogen in the molecule.\n3. Calculate the formal charge by subtracting the assigned electrons from the valence electrons.\n\nStep 1: Valence electrons for nitrogen\nNitrogen is in Group 15 (or Group 5A) of the periodic table, so it has 5 valence electrons in its neutral state.\n\nStep 2: Assigned electrons to nitrogen in NH4Cl\nIn the NH4+ ion, nitrogen is bonded to four hydrogen atoms, each with a single covalent bond. In a covalent bond, electrons are shared between atoms. Since there are four N-H bonds, nitrogen shares 4 electrons with the hydrogen atoms. However, in calculating formal charge, we only count half of the shared electrons. So, nitrogen gets 2 electrons from these bonds (4 shared electrons / 2).\n\nStep 3: Calculate the formal charge\nFormal charge = Valence electrons - Assigned electrons\nFormal charge = 5 - 2\nFormal charge = +3\n\nTherefore, the formal charge on the nitrogen atom in the ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) compound is +3."
