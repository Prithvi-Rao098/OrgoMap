    "message_2": "To calculate the heat required to raise the temperature of a substance, we can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat required, m is the mass of the substance, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nm = 50 grams\nc = 4.18 J/g °C\nΔT = 10 °C\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nq = (50 g) × (4.18 J/g °C) × (10 °C)\n\nq = 2090 J\n\nSo, the heat required to raise the temperature of 50 grams of water by 10 degrees Celsius is 2090 Joules."
