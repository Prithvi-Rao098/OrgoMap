    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy of formation (ΔH°f) of methane (CH4), we need to use Hess's Law, which states that the enthalpy change of a reaction is the same whether it occurs in one step or several steps. We can manipulate the given reactions to create a reaction that forms methane (CH4).\n\nFirst, we need to find the reaction that forms CH4. The balanced equation for the formation of methane is:\n\nC(graphite) + 2H2(g) → CH4(g)\n\nNow, we need to manipulate the given reactions to match this equation. \n\nFor the first reaction, we need to reverse it and divide by 2 to get:\n\nH2O(l) → H2(g) + 1/2O2(g)         ΔH°rxn = +286 kJ/mol\n\nFor the second reaction, we need to reverse it and add 2 moles of hydrogen to both sides:\n\nCO2(g) + 2H2(g) → C(graphite) + 2H2O(g)   ΔH°rxn = +394 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can add these two manipulated reactions together:\n\nH2O(l) → H2(g) + 1/2O2(g)         ΔH°rxn = +286 kJ/mol\nCO2(g) + 2H2(g) → C(graphite) + 2H2O(g)   ΔH°rxn = +394 kJ/mol\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nCO2(g) + H2O(l) → CH4(g) + 1/2O2(g)         ΔH°rxn = +680 kJ/mol\n\nFinally, we can calculate the standard enthalpy of formation (ΔH°f) of methane (CH4) by subtracting the enthalpy of formation of CO2 and H2O from the enthalpy of the reaction:\n\nΔH°f(CH4) = ΔH°rxn - ΔH°f(CO2) - ΔH°f(H2O)\nΔH°f(CH4) = +680 kJ/mol - (-394 kJ/mol) - 0\nΔH°f(CH4) = +680 kJ/mol + 394 kJ/mol\nΔH°f(CH4) = +1074 kJ/mol"
