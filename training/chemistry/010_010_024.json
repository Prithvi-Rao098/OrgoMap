    "message_1": "A student wishes to determine the power output of an electrochemical cell that utilizes a half-reaction of copper oxide reducing to copper and a half-reaction of zinc oxidizing to zinc ions. The initial concentrations of the copper and zinc ions in the cell are 1.00 M and 0.10 M, respectively. The cell operates for 60 minutes at a constant rate of 0.200 A. Given that the standard cell potential is 1.10 V, calculate the power output of the electrochemical cell.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the power output of the electrochemical cell, we can use the formula:\n\nPower (P) = Voltage (V) × Current (I)\n\nWe are given the standard cell potential (voltage) as 1.10 V and the current as 0.200 A. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nP = 1.10 V × 0.200 A\nP = 0.22 W (watts)\n\nThe power output of the electrochemical cell is 0.22 watts."
