    "message_2": "In an ethene (C₂H₄) molecule, each carbon atom is sp² hybridized. The hybrid orbitals involved in the bonding of carbon atoms in ethene are:\n\n1. One s orbital from each carbon atom\n2. Two p orbitals from each carbon atom\n\nDuring sp² hybridization, one s orbital and two p orbitals from each carbon atom mix to form three sp² hybrid orbitals. These sp² hybrid orbitals form sigma (σ) bonds with two hydrogen atoms and the other carbon atom in the ethene molecule. The remaining unhybridized p orbital on each carbon atom overlaps with the unhybridized p orbital on the other carbon atom to form a pi (π) bond. This results in a double bond between the two carbon atoms in the ethene molecule, with one σ bond and one π bond."
