    "message_2": "To synthesize a novel series of compounds with potent ACE-inhibitory activity, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Literature review: Start by reviewing the existing literature on ACE inhibitors and their structure-activity relationships (SAR). This will help you understand the key functional groups and structural features that contribute to their activity.\n\n2. Design novel compounds: Based on the SAR information, design a series of novel compounds that incorporate the essential features for ACE inhibition. You can use computational tools like molecular modeling and docking studies to predict the binding affinity of these compounds to the ACE enzyme.\n\n3. Synthesize the compounds: Develop synthetic routes to prepare the designed compounds. This may involve optimizing reaction conditions, selecting appropriate starting materials, and choosing suitable protecting groups and coupling agents.\n\n4. In vitro testing: Test the synthesized compounds for their ACE-inhibitory activity using in vitro assays, such as the fluorometric or colorimetric assays. This will help you determine the potency of the compounds and identify the most promising candidates for further study.\n\n5. Structure-activity relationship analysis: Analyze the results of the in vitro testing to refine the SAR and identify any trends or correlations between the compound structures and their activity. This information can be used to guide the design of additional compounds with improved potency and selectivity.\n\n6. In vivo testing: Evaluate the most promising compounds in animal models of hypertension and heart failure to assess their efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and safety profiles.\n\n7. Lead optimization: Based on the in vivo results, optimize the lead compounds by making further modifications to their structure to improve their potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic properties.\n\n8. Preclinical and clinical development: Once a lead compound with the desired properties has been identified, proceed with preclinical toxicology studies and, if successful, advance to clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the compound in humans.\n\nBy following these steps, you can synthesize a novel series of compounds with potent ACE-inhibitory activity and contribute to the development of new treatments for cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and heart failure."
