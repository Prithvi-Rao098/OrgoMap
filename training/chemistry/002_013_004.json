    "message_2": "Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) has a central sulfur atom surrounded by six fluorine atoms. To determine the hybridization of the central sulfur atom, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Count the number of electron groups (lone pairs and bonding pairs) around the central atom.\nIn SF6, the central sulfur atom is bonded to six fluorine atoms, so there are six electron groups (bonding pairs) around the sulfur atom.\n\n2. Determine the hybridization based on the number of electron groups.\nFor two electron groups, the hybridization is sp.\nFor three electron groups, the hybridization is sp2.\nFor four electron groups, the hybridization is sp3.\nFor five electron groups, the hybridization is sp3d.\nFor six electron groups, the hybridization is sp3d2.\n\nSince there are six electron groups around the central sulfur atom in SF6, the hybridization of the central sulfur atom is sp3d2."
