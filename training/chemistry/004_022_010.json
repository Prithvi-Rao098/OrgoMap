    "message_2": "To determine the concentration of sodium ions in the solution, we can use the Nernst equation, which relates the potential of an ion-selective electrode (ISE) to the concentration of the ion in question. The Nernst equation is given by:\n\nE = E0 + (RT/nF) * ln([Na+])\n\nWhere:\nE = measured potential (0.56 V)\nE0 = standard potential of the electrode (we will assume it is 0 V for simplicity)\nR = gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\nT = temperature (assuming 298 K, which is approximately room temperature)\nn = number of electrons transferred (1 for Na+)\nF = Faraday's constant (96485 C/mol)\n[Na+] = concentration of sodium ions\n\nFirst, let's convert the Nernst equation to the base 10 logarithm:\n\nE = E0 + (2.303 * RT/nF) * log10([Na+])\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and solve for [Na+]:\n\n0.56 V = 0 V + (2.303 * (8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K) / (1 * 96485 C/mol)) * log10([Na+])\n\n0.56 V = 0 V + (0.05916 V) * log10([Na+])\n\nNow, we can isolate log10([Na+]):\n\nlog10([Na+]) = 0.56 V / 0.05916 V = 9.47\n\nNow, we can find the concentration of sodium ions:\n\n[Na+] = 10^9.47\n\nHowever, this value seems unrealistic, as it is significantly higher than the initial concentration of 0.1 M NaCl. There might be an error in the potential measurement or the standard potential of the electrode. In a 0.1 M NaCl solution, we would expect the concentration of sodium ions to be approximately 0.1 M, as NaCl dissociates into Na+ and Cl- ions in a 1:1 ratio."
