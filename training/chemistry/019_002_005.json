    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy of formation for methane (CH4), we can use the heat of combustion and the enthalpies of formation for H2O and CO2. The balanced combustion reaction for methane is:\n\nCH4 (g) + 2 O2 (g) → CO2 (g) + 2 H2O (g)\n\nUsing Hess's Law, we can write the enthalpy change for this reaction as:\n\nΔH_combustion = ΔH_f (CO2) + 2 * ΔH_f (H2O) - ΔH_f (CH4)\n\nWe are given the heat of combustion for methane (-890.4 kJ/mol), the enthalpy of formation for H2O (-285.8 kJ/mol), and the enthalpy of formation for CO2 (-393.5 kJ/mol). We can now solve for the enthalpy of formation for methane (ΔH_f (CH4)):\n\n-890.4 kJ/mol = (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 * (-285.8 kJ/mol) - ΔH_f (CH4)\n\n-890.4 kJ/mol = -393.5 kJ/mol - 571.6 kJ/mol - ΔH_f (CH4)\n\nΔH_f (CH4) = -393.5 kJ/mol - 571.6 kJ/mol + 890.4 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_f (CH4) = -74.7 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy of formation for methane gas (CH4) at 298 K and 1 atm pressure is -74.7 kJ/mol."
