    "message_2": "To prepare 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene from nitrobenzene and chlorine gas, you can follow the electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. Here is a detailed step-by-step procedure:\n\n1. Set up the apparatus: You will need a round-bottom flask, a dropping funnel, a gas inlet tube, a condenser, a thermometer, a magnetic stirrer, and an ice bath.\n\n2. Add the solvent and catalyst: In the round-bottom flask, add 100 mL of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) as the solvent and 2 g of anhydrous aluminum chloride (AlCl3) as the catalyst. The aluminum chloride will help to generate the electrophilic chlorine species required for the reaction.\n\n3. Cool the reaction mixture: Place the round-bottom flask in an ice bath to maintain the temperature between 0-5°C. This will help to control the reaction rate and minimize side reactions.\n\n4. Add nitrobenzene: Slowly add 10 g (0.081 mol) of nitrobenzene to the reaction mixture using the dropping funnel. Make sure to maintain the temperature between 0-5°C.\n\n5. Introduce chlorine gas: Pass chlorine gas through the gas inlet tube into the reaction mixture at a slow and controlled rate. The molar ratio of nitrobenzene to chlorine should be 1:2, so you will need to add 0.162 mol of chlorine gas. The reaction will produce a yellow color as the chlorination occurs.\n\n6. Monitor the reaction: Monitor the reaction using thin-layer chromatography (TLC) to check for the formation of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene. The reaction may take several hours to complete.\n\n7. Quench the reaction: Once the reaction is complete, carefully add the reaction mixture to a mixture of crushed ice and concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl) to quench the reaction and decompose the aluminum chloride catalyst.\n\n8. Extract the product: Separate the organic layer containing the product using a separatory funnel. Wash the organic layer with water and then with a saturated sodium bicarbonate solution to remove any remaining acid.\n\n9. Dry and concentrate the product: Dry the organic layer over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) and filter. Evaporate the solvent using a rotary evaporator to obtain the crude product.\n\n10. Purify the product: The crude product can be purified using recrystallization or column chromatography. For recrystallization, dissolve the crude product in a minimum amount of hot solvent (e.g., ethanol or ethyl acetate) and then cool the solution slowly to allow the formation of crystals. For column chromatography, use silica gel as the stationary phase and a suitable solvent system (e.g., hexane/ethyl acetate) as the mobile phase.\n\n11. Characterize the product: Analyze the purified product using techniques such as melting point determination, infrared spectroscopy (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and mass spectrometry (MS) to confirm the structure and purity of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene.\n\nRemember to always follow safety precautions and wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) when handling chemicals and performing experiments."
