    "message_2": "The solubility of sodium chloride (NaCl) in water at 25°C is approximately 36 grams per 100 grams of water. This means that at 25°C, you can dissolve 36 grams of NaCl in 100 grams of water to form a saturated solution.\n\nSeveral factors affect the solubility of sodium chloride in water:\n\n1. Temperature: As the temperature increases, the solubility of NaCl in water generally increases. This is because higher temperatures provide more kinetic energy to the molecules, allowing them to overcome the forces holding the NaCl crystal lattice together and dissolve in water.\n\n2. Pressure: The solubility of NaCl in water is not significantly affected by pressure, as it is a solid solute. Pressure has a more significant effect on the solubility of gases in liquids.\n\n3. Presence of other ions: The solubility of NaCl can be affected by the presence of other ions in the solution. For example, the presence of ions with similar charges can cause competition for the solvent molecules, which may decrease the solubility of NaCl. This is known as the common ion effect.\n\n4. Nature of the solvent: The solubility of NaCl is highly dependent on the solvent used. In water, NaCl is highly soluble due to the polar nature of water molecules, which can interact with the positively charged sodium ions and negatively charged chloride ions. In nonpolar solvents, NaCl is generally insoluble."
