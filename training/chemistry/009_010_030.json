    "message_2": "The energy released during the detonation of a nuclear weapon is directly related to the mass defect of the fission products through Einstein's famous equation, E=mcÂ². In a nuclear weapon, the energy comes from the fission of heavy nuclei, such as uranium-235 or plutonium-239, into smaller, lighter nuclei (fission products). \n\nThe mass defect is the difference between the mass of the original heavy nucleus and the combined mass of the fission products. This mass difference is converted into energy during the fission process. The mass defect is a result of the binding energy that holds the nucleus together, which is released when the nucleus undergoes fission.\n\nAccording to Einstein's equation, the energy (E) released is equal to the mass defect (m) multiplied by the speed of light (c) squared. Since the speed of light is a very large number (approximately 3 x 10^8 meters per second), even a small mass defect can result in a significant amount of energy being released.\n\nIn the case of a nuclear weapon, the energy released from the mass defect of the fission products is what causes the massive explosion and destruction. The energy is released in the form of kinetic energy of the fission products, radiation, and heat, which together cause the devastating effects of a nuclear detonation."
