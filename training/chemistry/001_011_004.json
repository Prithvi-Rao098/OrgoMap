    "message_2": "The most efficient method for synthesizing a carboxylic acid from an alkyl halide is through a two-step process: first, the nucleophilic substitution of the alkyl halide with a cyanide ion (CN-) to form a nitrile, followed by hydrolysis of the nitrile to form the carboxylic acid. Here is a detailed mechanism, including all reagents and reaction conditions involved:\n\nStep 1: Nucleophilic substitution of the alkyl halide with a cyanide ion\nReagents: Sodium cyanide (NaCN) or potassium cyanide (KCN)\nSolvent: Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or another polar aprotic solvent\nReaction conditions: Room temperature or slightly elevated temperature (50-60°C), under an inert atmosphere (e.g., nitrogen or argon)\n\nMechanism:\n1. The cyanide ion (CN-) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon atom of the alkyl halide (R-X, where R is an alkyl group and X is a halogen).\n2. The bond between the carbon and the halogen breaks, with the halogen leaving as a halide ion (X-).\n3. The nitrile (R-CN) is formed as the product.\n\nStep 2: Hydrolysis of the nitrile to form the carboxylic acid\nReagents: Aqueous acid (e.g., H2SO4, HCl) or base (e.g., NaOH, KOH)\nSolvent: Water\nReaction conditions: Reflux (heating under continuous condensation) at 100-110°C for several hours\n\nMechanism (under acidic conditions):\n1. The carbonyl carbon of the nitrile (R-CN) is protonated by the acid (H+), forming an iminium ion (R-CNH+).\n2. A water molecule attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon, forming a tetrahedral intermediate.\n3. The iminium ion is deprotonated, resulting in the formation of an amide (R-CONH2).\n4. The amide nitrogen is protonated by the acid (H+), forming a protonated amide (R-CONH3+).\n5. A water molecule attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon, forming a second tetrahedral intermediate.\n6. The tetrahedral intermediate collapses, releasing a water molecule and forming a protonated carboxylic acid (R-COOH2+).\n7. The protonated carboxylic acid is deprotonated, yielding the final carboxylic acid product (R-COOH).\n\nMechanism (under basic conditions):\n1. The cyanide ion (CN-) is attacked by a hydroxide ion (OH-), forming a metal cyanate intermediate (R-CNO-).\n2. The metal cyanate intermediate rearranges to form an amide (R-CONH2).\n3. The amide is attacked by a hydroxide ion (OH-), forming a tetrahedral intermediate.\n4. The tetrahedral intermediate collapses, releasing an amine (NH2-) and forming a carboxylate ion (R-COO-).\n5. The carboxylate ion is protonated by water, yielding the final carboxylic acid product (R-COOH).\n\nIn summary, the most efficient method for synthesizing a carboxylic acid from an alkyl halide involves a two-step process: nucleophilic substitution with a cyanide ion to form a nitrile, followed by hydrolysis of the nitrile to form the carboxylic acid."
