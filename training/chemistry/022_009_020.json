    "message_2": "When you mix aqueous solutions of sodium chloride (NaCl) and calcium nitrate (Ca(NO3)2), a double displacement reaction occurs. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nNaCl(aq) + Ca(NO3)2(aq) â†’ NaNO3(aq) + CaCl2(aq)\n\nThe products of this reaction are sodium nitrate (NaNO3) and calcium chloride (CaCl2), both of which remain in the aqueous solution as no precipitate is formed."
