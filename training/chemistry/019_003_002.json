    "message_2": "To calculate the heat capacity of 50 grams of water, we can use the formula:\n\nHeat capacity (Q) = mass (m) × specific heat (c) × change in temperature (ΔT)\n\nIn this case, we are given the mass (m) as 50 grams, the specific heat (c) as 4.184 J/g°C, and the change in temperature (ΔT) is not given, but we can still calculate the heat capacity per degree Celsius.\n\nHeat capacity (Q) = 50 g × 4.184 J/g°C\n\nHeat capacity (Q) = 209.2 J/°C\n\nSo, the heat capacity of 50 grams of water at 25°C is 209.2 Joules per degree Celsius."
