Given the following balanced equation and enthalpies of formation: \n\n3H2(g) + N2(g) -> 2NH3(g)     ΔHf° = -46.1 kJ/mol (NH3)\n \nAdditionally, the enthalpy of formation for H2(g) is -285.8 kJ/mol and for N2(g) is 0 kJ/mol.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the following formula:\n\nΔH = ΣnΔHf(products) - ΣnΔHf(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH is the enthalpy change, n is the stoichiometric coefficient, and ΔHf is the enthalpy of formation.\n\nFor this reaction, we have:\n\nΔH = [2 moles(NH3) × -46.1 kJ/mol(NH3)] - [3 moles(H2) × -285.8 kJ/mol(H2) + 1 mole(N2) × 0 kJ/mol(N2)]\n\nHowever, we are given 2.5 moles of H2 and 1.5 moles of N2, which means the reaction is not balanced. We need to determine the limiting reactant. \n\nFor H2: 2.5 moles H2 × (1 mole N2 / 3 moles H2) = 0.833 moles N2 required\nFor N2: 1.5 moles N2 × (3 moles H2 / 1 mole N2) = 4.5 moles H2 required\n\nSince we only have 2.5 moles of H2, H2 is the limiting reactant. Now we can determine the actual amount of NH3 produced:\n\n2.5 moles H2 × (2 moles NH3 / 3 moles H2) = 1.667 moles NH3 produced\n\nNow we can calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nΔH = [1.667 moles(NH3) × -46.1 kJ/mol(NH3)] - [2.5 moles(H2) × -285.8 kJ/mol(H2) + 0.833 moles(N2) × 0 kJ/mol(N2)]\n\nΔH = (-76.8 kJ) - (-716.5 kJ)\nΔH = 639.7 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change for the reaction between 2.5 moles of hydrogen gas and 1.5 moles of nitrogen gas to produce ammonia gas is 639.7 kJ."
