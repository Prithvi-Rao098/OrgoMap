    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) for the given electrochemical reaction, we first need to determine the overall cell potential (E°cell) for the reaction. \n\nThe given half-reactions are:\n\n1. Ag+(aq) + e- -> Ag(s) E° = +0.80 V (Reduction)\n2. Cu2+(aq) + 2e- -> Cu(s) E° = +0.34 V (Reduction)\n\nWe need to reverse the second half-reaction to match the overall reaction:\n\nCu(s) -> Cu2+(aq) + 2e- E° = -0.34 V (Oxidation)\n\nNow, we can add the two half-reactions to get the overall cell potential:\n\nE°cell = E°(reduction) + E°(oxidation)\nE°cell = (+0.80 V) + (-0.34 V)\nE°cell = +0.46 V\n\nNext, we can use the relationship between Gibbs free energy change, cell potential, and the number of electrons transferred (n) in the reaction:\n\nΔG° = -nFE°cell\n\nwhere F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol).\n\nIn this reaction, 2 electrons are transferred (from Cu to 2Ag+), so n = 2.\n\nΔG° = -2 * 96,485 C/mol * 0.46 V\nΔG° = -88,766 J/mol\n\nThe Gibbs free energy change at standard conditions for the given electrochemical reaction is -88,766 J/mol."
