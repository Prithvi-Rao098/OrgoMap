    "message_2": "To calculate the standard electrode potential for the given redox reaction, we need to determine the difference in standard reduction potentials between the two half-reactions.\n\nThe given standard reduction potentials are:\n\nZn^2+(aq) + 2e⁻ -> Zn(s)    E° = -0.76 V\nCu^2+(aq) + 2e⁻ -> Cu(s)    E° = +0.34 V\n\nWe need to reverse the first half-reaction to make it an oxidation reaction:\n\nZn(s) -> Zn^2+(aq) + 2e⁻    E° = +0.76 V\n\nNow, we can add the two half-reactions together:\n\nZn(s) + Cu^2+(aq) -> Zn^2+(aq) + Cu(s)\n\nTo find the standard electrode potential (E°) for the overall reaction, we can add the standard reduction potentials of the two half-reactions:\n\nE°(overall) = E°(Zn oxidation) + E°(Cu reduction)\nE°(overall) = (+0.76 V) + (+0.34 V)\nE°(overall) = +1.10 V\n\nSo, the standard electrode potential for the given redox reaction is +1.10 V."
