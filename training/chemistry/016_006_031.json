    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the following formula:\n\nΔH_reaction = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of methane (CH4) in 5.00 grams:\n\nMolar mass of CH4 = 12.01 g/mol (C) + 4 * 1.01 g/mol (H) = 16.05 g/mol\n\nmoles of CH4 = mass / molar mass = 5.00 g / 16.05 g/mol = 0.3115 mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nΔH_reaction = [1 * ΔH_f(CO2) + 2 * ΔH_f(H2O)] - [1 * ΔH_f(CH4) + 2 * ΔH_f(O2)]\n\nSince the heat of formation for an element in its standard state is zero, ΔH_f(O2) = 0.\n\nΔH_reaction = [1 * (-393.51 kJ/mol) + 2 * (-285.84 kJ/mol)] - [1 * (-74.81 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH_reaction = (-393.51 - 2 * 285.84 + 74.81) kJ/mol\n\nΔH_reaction = (-393.51 - 571.68 + 74.81) kJ/mol\n\nΔH_reaction = -890.38 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change for the reaction is -890.38 kJ/mol."
