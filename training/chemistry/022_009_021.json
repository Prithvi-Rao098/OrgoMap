    "message_2": "When silver nitrate (AgNO₃) solution is mixed with sodium chloride (NaCl) solution, a double replacement reaction occurs, resulting in the formation of silver chloride (AgCl) precipitate and sodium nitrate (NaNO₃) solution. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nAgNO₃(aq) + NaCl(aq) → AgCl(s) + NaNO₃(aq)\n\nTo determine the amount of product formed, we can use the concept of limiting reactant. First, we need to find the moles of each reactant:\n\nMoles of AgNO₃ = (Volume × Molarity) = (0.025 L × 0.1 mol/L) = 0.0025 mol\nMoles of NaCl = (Volume × Molarity) = (0.035 L × 0.05 mol/L) = 0.00175 mol\n\nNow, we can find the mole ratio of AgNO₃ to NaCl in the balanced equation:\n\nMole ratio = (Moles of AgNO₃) / (Moles of NaCl) = (0.0025 mol) / (0.00175 mol) = 1.43\n\nSince the mole ratio is greater than 1, NaCl is the limiting reactant. Therefore, the amount of product formed (AgCl) will be based on the moles of NaCl:\n\nMoles of AgCl = Moles of NaCl = 0.00175 mol\n\nTo find the mass of AgCl formed, we can use the molar mass of AgCl (143.32 g/mol):\n\nMass of AgCl = (Moles of AgCl × Molar mass of AgCl) = (0.00175 mol × 143.32 g/mol) = 0.25056 g\n\nSo, the product formed when 25 ml of 0.1 M silver nitrate solution is mixed with 35 ml of 0.05 M sodium chloride solution is 0.25056 g of silver chloride (AgCl) precipitate."
