    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy change for the dissolution of sodium chloride (NaCl) in water, we first need to determine the number of moles of NaCl dissolved. \n\nThe molar mass of NaCl is approximately 58.44 g/mol (22.99 g/mol for Na and 35.45 g/mol for Cl). \n\nNow, we can calculate the number of moles of NaCl dissolved:\n\nmoles of NaCl = mass of NaCl / molar mass of NaCl\nmoles of NaCl = 5.00 g / 58.44 g/mol\nmoles of NaCl ≈ 0.0856 mol\n\nNow that we have the number of moles of NaCl, we can calculate the standard enthalpy change for the dissolution using the molar enthalpy of dissolution:\n\nΔH = moles of NaCl × molar enthalpy of dissolution\nΔH = 0.0856 mol × (-3.9 kJ/mol)\nΔH ≈ -0.333 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the dissolution of sodium chloride (NaCl) in water under the given conditions is approximately -0.333 kJ."
