    "message_2": "The preparation of p-nitroaniline from aniline and nitric acid can be carried out through a nitration reaction. Here is a step-by-step procedure for this reaction:\n\n1. Safety precautions: Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, goggles, and a lab coat. Work in a well-ventilated area or fume hood, as the reaction involves corrosive and toxic chemicals.\n\n2. Prepare the nitrating mixture: Slowly add concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) to concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) with constant stirring. The mixture should be cooled in an ice bath to maintain a low temperature (around 0-5째C) to prevent the formation of undesired by-products.\n\n3. Dissolve aniline: Dissolve aniline (C6H5NH2) in a minimal amount of glacial acetic acid (CH3COOH) to form an acetanilide derivative. This step is crucial to prevent the formation of meta- and ortho-nitroaniline isomers.\n\n4. Nitration reaction: Slowly add the cold nitrating mixture to the aniline solution with constant stirring. Maintain the temperature below 10째C to ensure selective para-nitration.\n\n5. Quench the reaction: After the addition is complete, slowly pour the reaction mixture into crushed ice and water to quench the reaction. The p-nitroaniline will precipitate as a solid.\n\n6. Isolation and purification: Filter the solid p-nitroaniline using vacuum filtration. Wash the solid with cold water to remove any remaining acid. Recrystallize the product from a suitable solvent (e.g., hot water or ethanol) to obtain pure p-nitroaniline crystals.\n\n7. Drying: Dry the purified p-nitroaniline crystals in a vacuum desiccator or an oven at a low temperature (40-50째C).\n\nTo confirm the purity of the final product, various analytical techniques can be employed:\n\n1. Melting point determination: Compare the melting point of the synthesized p-nitroaniline with the literature value (147-149째C). A sharp melting point close to the literature value indicates high purity.\n\n2. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC): Perform TLC analysis to check for the presence of any impurities or unreacted starting materials. A single spot on the TLC plate indicates a pure product.\n\n3. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy: Analyze the IR spectrum of the synthesized p-nitroaniline and compare it with the reference spectrum. The presence of characteristic peaks (e.g., nitro group peak around 1530-1350 cm-1) and the absence of starting material peaks confirm the purity of the product.\n\n4. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy: Obtain 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra of the synthesized p-nitroaniline and compare them with reference spectra. The presence of characteristic signals and the absence of impurity signals confirm the purity of the product.\n\n5. Elemental analysis: Perform elemental analysis (CHN analysis) to determine the percentage of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen in the synthesized p-nitroaniline. Compare the obtained values with the theoretical values for p-nitroaniline to confirm the purity of the product."
