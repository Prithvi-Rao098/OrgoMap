    "message_2": "To determine whether a molecule exhibits geometrical or optical isomerism, you need to examine its structure and bonding. Here's how you can identify each type of isomerism:\n\n1. Geometrical isomerism (cis-trans or E-Z isomerism):\nGeometrical isomerism occurs in molecules with restricted rotation around a double bond or in cyclic compounds. To identify if a molecule exhibits geometrical isomerism, look for the following features:\n\na. The presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) or a cyclic structure that restricts rotation.\nb. Two different groups or atoms attached to each of the carbon atoms involved in the double bond or the restricted rotation.\n\nIf these conditions are met, the molecule can exhibit geometrical isomerism. For example, in but-2-ene (CH3CH=CHCH3), there is a double bond between the second and third carbon atoms, and each carbon has two different groups attached to it (a hydrogen and an ethyl group). This molecule exhibits geometrical isomerism.\n\n2. Optical isomerism (enantiomers):\nOptical isomerism occurs in molecules that have a chiral center, which means they are non-superimposable on their mirror image. To identify if a molecule exhibits optical isomerism, look for the following features:\n\na. The presence of a chiral center, which is typically a carbon atom with four different groups or atoms attached to it (called a stereocenter).\nb. The molecule should not have an internal plane of symmetry.\n\nIf these conditions are met, the molecule can exhibit optical isomerism. For example, in 2-butanol (CH3CH(OH)CH2CH3), the second carbon atom is a chiral center, as it has four different groups attached to it (a hydrogen, a hydroxyl group, a methyl group, and an ethyl group). This molecule exhibits optical isomerism.\n\nIn summary, to determine whether a molecule exhibits geometrical or optical isomerism, examine its structure for the presence of restricted rotation (for geometrical isomerism) or chiral centers (for optical isomerism)."
