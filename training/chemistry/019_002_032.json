    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy of formation (ΔH°f) for butane (C4H10), we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH°f (C4H10) = Σ ΔH°f (products) - Σ ΔH°f (reactants)\n\nThe complete combustion of butane can be represented by the following balanced chemical equation:\n\nC4H10(g) + 13/2 O2(g) → 4 CO2(g) + 5 H2O(l)\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard enthalpy of formation for butane using the given data:\n\nΔH°f (C4H10) = [4 × ΔH°f (CO2) + 5 × ΔH°f (H2O)] - [ΔH°f (C4H10) + 13/2 × ΔH°f (O2)]\n\nSince the standard enthalpy of formation for elements in their standard state is zero, ΔH°f (C(s)) = ΔH°f (H2(g)) = ΔH°f (O2(g)) = 0.\n\nWe are given the standard enthalpies of combustion for C4H10, CO2, and H2O as -2877.2, -393.5, and -285.8 kJ/mol, respectively. We can use these values to find the standard enthalpies of formation for CO2 and H2O:\n\nΔH°f (CO2) = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔH°f (H2O) = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔH°f (C4H10) = [4 × (-393.5) + 5 × (-285.8)] - [ΔH°f (C4H10)]\n\nΔH°f (C4H10) = [-1574 + (-1429)] - [ΔH°f (C4H10)]\n\nΔH°f (C4H10) = -3003 - ΔH°f (C4H10)\n\nNow, we can use the given standard enthalpy of combustion for C4H10:\n\n-2877.2 = -3003 - ΔH°f (C4H10)\n\nΔH°f (C4H10) = -3003 + 2877.2\n\nΔH°f (C4H10) = 125.8 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy of formation for butane (C4H10) is 125.8 kJ/mol."
