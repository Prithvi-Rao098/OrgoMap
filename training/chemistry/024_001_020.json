    "message_2": "To find the minimum volume required for the CSTR, we can use the following formula:\n\nVolume (V) = Flow rate (Q) × Residence time (τ)\n\nGiven the flow rate (Q) is 2 L/min and the residence time (τ) is 10 minutes, we can calculate the volume as follows:\n\nV = 2 L/min × 10 min\n\nV = 20 L\n\nHowever, this volume calculation assumes a 100% conversion. Since the desired conversion is 90%, we need to adjust the volume accordingly. We can do this by dividing the calculated volume by the desired conversion fraction:\n\nAdjusted Volume (V_adj) = V / Conversion\n\nV_adj = 20 L / 0.9\n\nV_adj ≈ 22.22 L\n\nTherefore, the minimum volume required for the CSTR to achieve a 90% conversion is approximately 22.22 L."
