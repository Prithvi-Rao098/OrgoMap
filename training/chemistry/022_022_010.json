    "message_1": "A question for the student to solve could be: \n\nIf a certain equilibrium reaction is exothermic, and the concentration of reactant A is increased while the concentration of product B is decreased, predict the change in the equilibrium constant value (K) and explain your reasoning by applying Le Chatelier's principle.",
    "message_2": "When an equilibrium reaction is exothermic, it releases heat as it proceeds from reactants to products. According to Le Chatelier's principle, if a change is made to a system at equilibrium, the system will adjust itself to counteract the change and restore a new equilibrium.\n\nIn this case, the concentration of reactant A is increased, and the concentration of product B is decreased. According to Le Chatelier's principle, the system will try to counteract these changes by shifting the equilibrium position to consume the excess reactant A and produce more product B. This means the reaction will shift to the right (toward the products).\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the equilibrium constant (K) is not affected by changes in concentration. The equilibrium constant is only affected by changes in temperature. Since there is no mention of a change in temperature in this problem, the equilibrium constant (K) will remain the same.\n\nIn summary, the equilibrium position will shift to the right, favoring the formation of more product B, but the equilibrium constant (K) will not change as it is not affected by changes in concentration."
