    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat energy released, we first need to determine the number of moles of methane (CH4) in 25 grams.\n\nThe molar mass of methane (CH4) is:\nC: 12.01 g/mol\nH: 1.01 g/mol\nTotal: 12.01 + (4 x 1.01) = 16.05 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the number of moles of methane in 25 grams:\nmoles = mass / molar mass\nmoles = 25 g / 16.05 g/mol = 1.557 moles\n\nSince the enthalpy of combustion for methane is -890.4 kJ/mol, we can now calculate the amount of heat energy released:\nheat energy = moles × enthalpy of combustion\nheat energy = 1.557 moles × -890.4 kJ/mol = -1385.6 kJ\n\nTherefore, the amount of heat energy released when 25 grams of methane is burned completely in oxygen gas is approximately -1385.6 kJ. The negative sign indicates that the reaction is exothermic and releases heat."
