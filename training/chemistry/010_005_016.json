    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant (K) for the given electrochemical reaction, we first need to determine the overall cell potential (E°) and the balanced redox reaction.\n\nThe balanced redox reaction is:\nCu(s) + 2Cr³⁺(aq) → Cu²⁺(aq) + 2Cr(s)\n\nThe cell potential (E°) can be calculated using the standard reduction potentials:\nE° = E°(cathode) - E°(anode)\n\nSince Cu²⁺/Cu has a more positive standard reduction potential, it will act as the cathode, and Cr³⁺/Cr will act as the anode.\n\nE° = (+0.34 V) - (-0.74 V) = +1.08 V\n\nNow we can use the Nernst equation to relate the cell potential to the equilibrium constant (K). The Nernst equation is:\n\nE = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\n\nAt equilibrium, the cell potential (E) is 0, and Q becomes K:\n\n0 = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(K)\n\nWe can rearrange the equation to solve for K:\n\nln(K) = nFE°/RT\n\nWhere:\nn = number of electrons transferred in the balanced redox reaction (2 in this case)\nF = Faraday's constant (96,485 C/mol)\nR = gas constant (8.314 J/mol K)\nT = temperature (298 K)\n\nln(K) = (2 * 96,485 C/mol * 1.08 V) / (8.314 J/mol K * 298 K)\n\nln(K) ≈ 52.6\n\nNow, we can take the exponent of both sides to find K:\n\nK ≈ e^52.6 ≈ 4.7 × 10^22\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (K) for the given electrochemical reaction is approximately 4.7 × 10^22."
