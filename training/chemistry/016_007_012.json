    "message_2": "The standard enthalpy of formation of ammonia gas (NH3) at 298 K is -46.11 kJ/mol. This value is found in standard thermodynamic tables and represents the enthalpy change when one mole of ammonia is formed from its constituent elements, nitrogen gas (N2) and hydrogen gas (H2), under standard conditions (298 K and 1 atm pressure)."
