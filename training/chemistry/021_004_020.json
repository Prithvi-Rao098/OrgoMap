    "message_2": "The central atom in the molecule CH3Cl is carbon (C). To determine the hybridization of the central atom, we need to consider the number of electron domains around the carbon atom. In CH3Cl, carbon is bonded to three hydrogen atoms and one chlorine atom, making a total of four electron domains.\n\nSince there are four electron domains, the hybridization of the central carbon atom in CH3Cl is sp3."
