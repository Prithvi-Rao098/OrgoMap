    "message_2": "To convert the energy of the gamma ray from keV (kilo-electron volts) to eV (electron volts), you simply multiply by 1000, as there are 1000 eV in 1 keV.\n\nSo, for a gamma ray with an energy of 511 keV:\n\nEnergy (eV) = 511 keV Ã— 1000 eV/keV = 511,000 eV\n\nThe energy of the gamma ray emitted during the decay of the radioactive nucleus is 511,000 eV."
