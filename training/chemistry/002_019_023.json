    "message_2": "The Clausius-Clapeyron equation is used to determine the relationship between the vapor pressure and temperature of a substance. However, it is not the most suitable equation for calculating the melting and boiling points of a substance directly. Instead, we can use the given information to estimate the melting and boiling points.\n\nThe melting point can be estimated using the heat of fusion (ΔHfus) and the standard entropy change for phase transition (ΔS):\n\nTm = ΔHfus / ΔS\n\nWhere Tm is the melting point in Kelvin.\n\nGiven that the heat of fusion for NaCl is 28.9 kJ/mol, we need to convert it to J/mol:\n\nΔHfus = 28.9 kJ/mol * 1000 J/kJ = 28900 J/mol\n\nNow we can calculate the melting point:\n\nTm = (28900 J/mol) / (72.14 J/K/mol) = 400.4 K\n\nThe boiling point can be estimated using the heat of vaporization (ΔHvap) and the standard entropy change for phase transition (ΔS):\n\nTb = ΔHvap / ΔS\n\nGiven that the heat of vaporization for NaCl is 163.0 kJ/mol, we need to convert it to J/mol:\n\nΔHvap = 163.0 kJ/mol * 1000 J/kJ = 163000 J/mol\n\nNow we can calculate the boiling point:\n\nTb = (163000 J/mol) / (72.14 J/K/mol) = 2259.6 K\n\nSo, the estimated melting point of Sodium Chloride (NaCl) is 400.4 K, and the estimated boiling point is 2259.6 K."
