    "message_2": "Magnesium oxide (MgO) exhibits ionic bonding. Ionic bonding occurs when there is a transfer of electrons between a metal and a non-metal atom, resulting in the formation of positive and negative ions that are attracted to each other due to their opposite charges.\n\nIn the case of magnesium oxide, magnesium (Mg) is a metal from Group 2 of the periodic table, and it has two valence electrons. Oxygen (O) is a non-metal from Group 16 and has six valence electrons. Magnesium loses its two valence electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration, forming a Mg2+ ion. Oxygen gains these two electrons to complete its octet, forming an O2- ion. The electrostatic attraction between the Mg2+ and O2- ions results in the formation of an ionic bond.\n\nThe characteristics of ionic bonding exhibited in magnesium oxide include:\n\n1. High melting and boiling points: Ionic compounds, such as MgO, generally have high melting and boiling points due to the strong electrostatic forces between the positive and negative ions. Magnesium oxide has a melting point of 2,852째C (5,166째F) and a boiling point of 3,600째C (6,512째F).\n\n2. Brittleness: Ionic compounds tend to be brittle, as the strong ionic bonds are disrupted when a force is applied, causing the compound to break apart. Magnesium oxide is a brittle, white solid.\n\n3. Electrical conductivity: In the solid state, ionic compounds like MgO do not conduct electricity, as the ions are held in a fixed lattice structure and cannot move freely. However, when dissolved in water or in a molten state, the ions become free to move, allowing the compound to conduct electricity.\n\n4. Solubility in polar solvents: Ionic compounds are generally soluble in polar solvents, such as water, due to the strong interactions between the ions and the polar solvent molecules. Magnesium oxide is moderately soluble in water."
