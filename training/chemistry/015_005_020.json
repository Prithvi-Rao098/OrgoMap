    "message_2": "To calculate the change in entropy (ΔS) for the reaction, we need to find the difference between the entropy of the products and the entropy of the reactants. We can use the standard molar entropies (S°) for each substance at 298 K and 1 atm, which can be found in standard thermodynamic tables.\n\nStandard molar entropies (S°) at 298 K and 1 atm:\nH2(g) = 130.68 J/mol·K\nCl2(g) = 223.07 J/mol·K\nHCl(g) = 186.90 J/mol·K\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\nH2(g) + Cl2(g) → 2HCl(g)\n\nNow, we can calculate the change in entropy (ΔS) using the following equation:\nΔS = ΣS°(products) - ΣS°(reactants)\n\nΔS = [2 * S°(HCl)] - [S°(H2) + S°(Cl2)]\n\nΔS = [2 * 186.90 J/mol·K] - [130.68 J/mol·K + 223.07 J/mol·K]\n\nΔS = [373.80 J/mol·K] - [353.75 J/mol·K]\n\nΔS = 20.05 J/mol·K\n\nThe change in entropy (ΔS) for the reaction is 20.05 J/mol·K."
