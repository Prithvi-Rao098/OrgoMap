    "message_2": "Potentiometry is a technique used to measure the potential (voltage) of an electrochemical cell, which can be related to the concentration of a specific ion in the solution. In this case, we are interested in the concentration of chloride ions (Cl-) in a 0.1 M sodium chloride (NaCl) solution.\n\nIn a sodium chloride solution, NaCl dissociates into sodium ions (Na+) and chloride ions (Cl-). The dissociation can be represented by the following equation:\n\nNaCl â†’ Na+ + Cl-\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, the concentration of chloride ions will be equal to the concentration of sodium chloride. Therefore, in a 0.1 M NaCl solution, the concentration of chloride ions (Cl-) will also be 0.1 M."
