    "message_2": "The coordination geometry of the central metal ion in the complex [Co(NH3)6]Cl3 is octahedral. This is because there are six ammonia (NH3) ligands surrounding the cobalt (Co) ion, forming six coordinate covalent bonds.\n\nThe oxidation state of the central metal ion (cobalt) can be determined by considering the charges of the ligands and the overall charge of the complex. Ammonia (NH3) is a neutral ligand, so it does not contribute to the charge of the complex. The complex has a charge of +3, which is balanced by the three chloride (Cl-) ions outside the coordination sphere. Therefore, the oxidation state of the cobalt ion is +3."
