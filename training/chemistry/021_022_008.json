    "message_2": "An organic molecule containing both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an amine group (-NH2) is called a zwitterion or an amphoteric molecule. The overall acidity or basicity of such a molecule depends on the relative strengths of the acidic and basic groups and their pKa values.\n\nCarboxylic acid groups are acidic in nature due to the presence of the acidic hydrogen atom in the -COOH group. When this hydrogen ion is donated to a solution, it forms a carboxylate anion (-COO-) and releases a proton (H+). The pKa value of a carboxylic acid group typically ranges from 4 to 5, which indicates its acidic strength.\n\nOn the other hand, amine groups are basic in nature. The nitrogen atom in the amine group has a lone pair of electrons, which can accept a proton (H+) from the solution, forming an ammonium ion (-NH3+). The pKa value of an amine group typically ranges from 9 to 11, which indicates its basic strength.\n\nIn an aqueous solution, the carboxylic acid group can lose a proton to form a carboxylate anion, and the amine group can accept a proton to form an ammonium ion. This results in a zwitterionic form of the molecule, which has both a positive and a negative charge. The overall charge of the molecule is neutral, but the molecule can act as either an acid or a base depending on the pH of the solution.\n\nAt a pH lower than the pKa of the carboxylic acid group, the molecule will predominantly exist in its protonated form, with the carboxylic acid group retaining its acidic hydrogen and the amine group accepting a proton. In this case, the molecule will have an overall positive charge and will act as an acid.\n\nAt a pH higher than the pKa of the amine group, the molecule will predominantly exist in its deprotonated form, with the carboxylic acid group losing its acidic hydrogen and the amine group retaining its lone pair of electrons. In this case, the molecule will have an overall negative charge and will act as a base.\n\nIn the pH range between the pKa values of the carboxylic acid and amine groups, the molecule will exist primarily in its zwitterionic form, with the carboxylic acid group deprotonated and the amine group protonated. In this case, the molecule can act as either an acid or a base depending on the specific conditions of the solution.\n\nIn summary, the expected acidity or basicity of an organic molecule containing both a carboxylic acid group and an amine group depends on the pH of the solution and the relative strengths of the acidic and basic groups. The molecule can act as an acid, a base, or a zwitterion depending on the specific conditions."
