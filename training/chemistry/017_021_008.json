    "message_2": "The chiral nature of molecules can significantly affect their photochemical properties, as the stereochemistry of a molecule can influence its interaction with light and subsequent reactivity. Chiral molecules are those that cannot be superimposed on their mirror images, and they often exist as two enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images). The relationship between stereochemistry and reactivity with light is mainly due to the different ways that enantiomers interact with plane-polarized light, which can lead to different photochemical reactions.\n\nWhen chiral molecules absorb light, they can undergo various processes, such as electronic excitation, isomerization, or bond cleavage. The stereochemistry of the molecule can influence the probability of these processes occurring, as well as the products formed. This is because the spatial arrangement of atoms in a chiral molecule can affect the distribution of electron density and the accessibility of reactive sites, which in turn can influence the molecule's reactivity with light.\n\nOne specific example of chiral molecules that exhibit different photochemical reactions depending on their stereochemistry is the photoisomerization of azobenzene derivatives. Azobenzene is a molecule that can undergo reversible photoisomerization between its cis and trans isomers. When chiral substituents are attached to the azobenzene core, the two enantiomers can exhibit different rates of photoisomerization and different quantum yields. This is because the steric interactions between the chiral substituents and the azobenzene core can influence the energy barriers for isomerization and the accessibility of the reactive sites.\n\nAnother example is the photochemical reactions of chiral cyclohexadienones. The enantiomers of these molecules can undergo different photochemical reactions, such as [2+2] cycloaddition or 1,5-hydrogen shift, depending on their stereochemistry. The stereochemistry of the molecule can influence the relative energies of the excited states and the transition states for these reactions, leading to different product distributions.\n\nIn conclusion, the chiral nature of molecules can significantly affect their photochemical properties, as the stereochemistry can influence the interaction of the molecules with light and their subsequent reactivity. This relationship between stereochemistry and reactivity with light is mainly due to the different ways that enantiomers interact with plane-polarized light and the influence of the spatial arrangement of atoms on the distribution of electron density and the accessibility of reactive sites. Examples of chiral molecules that exhibit different photochemical reactions depending on their stereochemistry include azobenzene derivatives and cyclohexadienones."
