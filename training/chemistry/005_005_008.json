    "message_2": "The three-dimensional structure of the nucleotide bases within a single strand of RNA is determined by the linear sequence of the four nucleotide bases: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and uracil (U). These bases are connected by a sugar-phosphate backbone, which forms the primary structure of RNA. However, RNA molecules can fold into more complex secondary and tertiary structures due to the hydrogen bonding between complementary bases and other interactions within the molecule.\n\nIn the secondary structure, RNA molecules can form base-pairing interactions, such as A-U and G-C pairs, which lead to the formation of double-stranded regions, loops, and hairpin structures. These structures are stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the bases and other non-covalent interactions, such as van der Waals forces and electrostatic interactions.\n\nThe tertiary structure of RNA is formed by the folding of the secondary structure into a compact, three-dimensional shape. This folding is driven by various interactions, including base stacking, hydrogen bonding, and interactions between the sugar-phosphate backbone and the bases. The tertiary structure is crucial for the function of the RNA molecule, as it determines its interaction with other molecules, such as proteins and other RNA molecules.\n\nThe three-dimensional structure of RNA affects its function in several ways:\n\n1. Specificity: The unique sequence and structure of RNA molecules allow them to recognize and bind to specific target molecules, such as mRNA, tRNA, or proteins, with high specificity.\n\n2. Catalytic activity: Some RNA molecules, known as ribozymes, can catalyze chemical reactions. The tertiary structure of these ribozymes is crucial for their catalytic activity, as it positions the reactive groups in the correct orientation for the reaction to occur.\n\n3. Stability: The secondary and tertiary structures of RNA molecules can provide stability against degradation by nucleases, which are enzymes that cleave the phosphodiester bonds in the RNA backbone.\n\n4. Regulation: The three-dimensional structure of RNA can also play a role in the regulation of gene expression. For example, small non-coding RNA molecules, such as microRNAs, can bind to complementary sequences in target mRNA molecules, leading to the inhibition of translation or degradation of the mRNA.\n\nIn summary, the three-dimensional structure of nucleotide bases within a single strand of RNA plays a crucial role in determining the function of the RNA molecule, including its specificity, catalytic activity, stability, and regulatory roles."
