    "message_1": "What mass of silver (Ag) is deposited on the cathode when a current of 5 A is passed through silver nitrate (AgNO3) solution for 20 minutes? The electrode potential of silver is +0.80 V and the Faraday constant is 96,485 C/mol. The atomic mass of silver is 107.87 g/mol.",
    "message_2": "To determine the mass of silver deposited on the cathode, we need to find the number of moles of silver reduced and then convert it to mass using the atomic mass of silver.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total charge passed through the solution. The charge (Q) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nQ = I × t\n\nwhere I is the current (5 A) and t is the time (20 minutes = 1200 seconds).\n\nQ = 5 A × 1200 s = 6000 C\n\nNow, we need to find the number of moles of electrons (n) transferred during the reaction. This can be calculated using the Faraday constant (F):\n\nn = Q / F\n\nn = 6000 C / 96,485 C/mol = 0.0622 mol\n\nSince the reduction of silver involves one electron transfer per silver atom (Ag+ + e- → Ag), the number of moles of silver reduced is equal to the number of moles of electrons transferred:\n\nn(Ag) = 0.0622 mol\n\nNow, we can find the mass of silver deposited using the atomic mass of silver (M(Ag) = 107.87 g/mol):\n\nmass(Ag) = n(Ag) × M(Ag)\n\nmass(Ag) = 0.0622 mol × 107.87 g/mol = 6.71 g\n\nTherefore, 6.71 grams of silver is deposited on the cathode when a current of 5 A is passed through the silver nitrate solution for 20 minutes."
