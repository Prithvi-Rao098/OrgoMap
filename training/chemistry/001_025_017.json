    "message_2": "Biomolecules are organic molecules that are essential for the proper functioning of living organisms. They are classified into four major types based on their chemical structures and functions: carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids.\n\n1. Carbohydrates: These are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms, and their primary function is to provide energy to living organisms. Carbohydrates are classified into three main groups: monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides.\n\n- Monosaccharides: These are the simplest carbohydrates, consisting of a single sugar unit. Examples include glucose, fructose, and galactose. They serve as the building blocks for more complex carbohydrates and are a primary source of energy for cells.\n- Disaccharides: These consist of two monosaccharide units linked together. Examples include sucrose (glucose + fructose), lactose (glucose + galactose), and maltose (glucose + glucose). They are broken down into monosaccharides during digestion to provide energy.\n- Polysaccharides: These are complex carbohydrates composed of long chains of monosaccharide units. Examples include starch, glycogen, and cellulose. They serve as energy storage molecules and provide structural support in plants (cellulose).\n\n2. Lipids: These are hydrophobic (water-insoluble) molecules composed mainly of carbon and hydrogen atoms. They are classified into several categories, including fats, phospholipids, and steroids.\n\n- Fats: These are composed of glycerol and fatty acids and serve as energy storage molecules. Examples include triglycerides, which are found in adipose tissue.\n- Phospholipids: These are composed of glycerol, fatty acids, and a phosphate group. They are the main component of cell membranes, providing a barrier between the cell and its environment.\n- Steroids: These are composed of four fused carbon rings and have various functions, including hormone production and cell membrane stability. Examples include cholesterol and steroid hormones like testosterone and estrogen.\n\n3. Proteins: These are composed of amino acids linked together by peptide bonds. They are responsible for a wide range of functions in living organisms, including catalyzing chemical reactions (enzymes), providing structural support (collagen), and facilitating cell communication (hormones).\n\n- Enzymes: These are proteins that act as biological catalysts, speeding up chemical reactions in cells. Examples include amylase, which breaks down starch, and lactase, which breaks down lactose.\n- Structural proteins: These provide support and shape to cells and tissues. Examples include collagen, which forms the extracellular matrix in connective tissues, and actin and myosin, which are involved in muscle contraction.\n- Hormones: These are proteins that act as chemical messengers, regulating various physiological processes. Examples include insulin, which regulates blood sugar levels, and growth hormone, which stimulates cell growth and division.\n\n4. Nucleic acids: These are composed of nucleotide units and are responsible for storing and transmitting genetic information. There are two main types of nucleic acids: DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid).\n\n- DNA: This is the genetic material that contains the instructions for building and maintaining an organism. It is composed of two complementary strands that form a double helix structure. DNA stores genetic information in the form of genes, which code for specific proteins.\n- RNA: This is involved in various aspects of gene expression, including transcription (copying DNA into RNA) and translation (using RNA to build proteins). There are several types of RNA, including messenger RNA (mRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), and ribosomal RNA (rRNA).\n\nIn summary, biomolecules play crucial roles in the structure, function, and regulation of living organisms. Carbohydrates provide energy and structural support, lipids store energy and form cell membranes, proteins perform a wide range of functions, and nucleic acids store and transmit genetic information."
