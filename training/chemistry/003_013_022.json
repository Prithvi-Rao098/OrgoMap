    "message_2": "To calculate the maximum work that can be obtained when a hot gas is expanded irreversibly and adiabatically, we can use the formula for work done during an irreversible process:\n\nW = -P_ext * (V_final - V_initial)\n\nFirst, we need to find the final volume (V_final) of the gas. To do this, we can use the ideal gas law:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nWhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol*K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nSince the process is adiabatic, the change in internal energy is equal to the work done:\n\nΔU = Q - W = 0 (since Q = 0 for an adiabatic process)\n\nFor an ideal gas, the change in internal energy can be expressed as:\n\nΔU = (3/2)nRΔT\n\nSince ΔU = 0, we have:\n\n0 = (3/2)nRΔT\n\nΔT = 0\n\nThis means that the temperature remains constant throughout the process. Now we can find the final volume using the initial and final pressures and the ideal gas law:\n\nP_initial * V_initial = nRT_initial\nP_final * V_final = nRT_final\n\nSince T_initial = T_final, we can write:\n\nP_initial * V_initial = P_final * V_final\n\nNow we can plug in the given values:\n\n(1.00 atm) * V_final = (3.00 moles) * (0.0821 L*atm/mol*K) * (400 K) / (2.00 atm)\n\nV_final = (3.00 * 0.0821 * 400) / 2\nV_final = 49.26 L\n\nNow we can calculate the work done during the irreversible adiabatic expansion:\n\nW = -P_ext * (V_final - V_initial)\nW = -(1.00 atm) * (49.26 L - 2.50 L)\n\nTo convert the work from L*atm to Joules, we can use the conversion factor 101.325 J/L*atm:\n\nW = - (46.76 L*atm) * (101.325 J/L*atm)\nW = -4738.57 J\n\nThe maximum work that can be obtained when the hot gas is expanded irreversibly and adiabatically is -4738.57 Joules. The negative sign indicates that the work is done by the system (the gas) on the surroundings."
