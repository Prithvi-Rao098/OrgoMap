    "message_1": "A chemistry student needs to calculate the concentration of copper(II) ions in a 250 mL solution, given that a current of 1.5 A was applied for 60 minutes to a copper electrode in contact with the solution. The initial concentration of copper(II) ions was 0.05 M, and the Faraday constant is 96,485 C/mol. What is the final concentration of copper(II) ions in the solution?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the final concentration of copper(II) ions in the solution, we need to determine the amount of copper ions that were deposited on the electrode during the electrolysis process.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total charge (Q) that passed through the solution during the electrolysis process:\n\nQ = current (I) × time (t)\nQ = 1.5 A × (60 min × 60 s/min) = 1.5 A × 3600 s = 5400 C\n\nNext, we need to find the number of moles of electrons (n) that were transferred during the electrolysis process:\n\nn = Q / Faraday constant (F)\nn = 5400 C / 96,485 C/mol = 0.056 mol\n\nSince the copper(II) ions have a charge of +2, the number of moles of copper ions that were deposited on the electrode is half the number of moles of electrons:\n\nmoles of Cu²⁺ = 0.056 mol / 2 = 0.028 mol\n\nNow, we need to find the change in concentration of copper(II) ions in the solution:\n\nΔ[Cu²⁺] = moles of Cu²⁺ / volume of solution (in L)\nΔ[Cu²⁺] = 0.028 mol / (250 mL × 0.001 L/mL) = 0.028 mol / 0.25 L = 0.112 M\n\nSince the copper ions were deposited on the electrode, the final concentration of copper(II) ions in the solution will be the initial concentration minus the change in concentration:\n\nFinal [Cu²⁺] = Initial [Cu²⁺] - Δ[Cu²⁺]\nFinal [Cu²⁺] = 0.05 M - 0.112 M = -0.062 M\n\nHowever, the concentration cannot be negative. This means that all the copper(II) ions were deposited on the electrode, and the final concentration of copper(II) ions in the solution is 0 M."
