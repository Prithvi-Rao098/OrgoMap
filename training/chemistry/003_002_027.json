    "message_2": "To determine the minimum pressure required to liquefy carbon dioxide gas at a temperature of -50°C, we need to refer to the phase diagram of CO2. A phase diagram shows the regions of stability for different phases (solid, liquid, and gas) of a substance as a function of temperature and pressure.\n\nFor carbon dioxide, the phase diagram indicates that at -50°C (223 K), the substance can exist as a gas or a liquid depending on the pressure. The transition between the gas and liquid phases occurs at the vapor pressure of CO2 at that temperature.\n\nTo find the vapor pressure of CO2 at -50°C, we can use the Antoine equation, which is an empirical relationship between vapor pressure and temperature for a pure substance:\n\nlog10(P) = A - (B / (T + C))\n\nwhere P is the vapor pressure, T is the temperature in Celsius, and A, B, and C are substance-specific constants. For carbon dioxide, the constants are:\n\nA = 6.81228\nB = 1301.679\nC = -3.494\n\nPlugging in the temperature of -50°C into the equation:\n\nlog10(P) = 6.81228 - (1301.679 / (-50 + -3.494))\nP = 10^(log10(P))\n\nSolving for P, we get:\n\nP ≈ 5.11 atm\n\nTherefore, the minimum pressure required to liquefy carbon dioxide gas at a temperature of -50°C is approximately 5.11 atmospheres."
