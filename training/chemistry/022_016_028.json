Assume a density of 1 g/mL for the solution.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to determine the amount of heat absorbed by the solution during the reaction. We can do this using the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat absorbed, m is the mass of the solution, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nGiven the density of the solution is 1 g/mL, the mass of the 50 mL solution is:\n\nm = 50 mL * 1 g/mL = 50 g\n\nThe specific heat capacity (c) is given as 4.18 J/g°C, and the change in temperature (ΔT) is:\n\nΔT = T_final - T_initial = 35°C - 25°C = 10°C\n\nNow we can calculate the heat absorbed (q):\n\nq = (50 g) * (4.18 J/g°C) * (10°C) = 2090 J\n\nNext, we need to determine the moles of HCl in the solution. We can do this using the formula:\n\nmoles = Molarity * Volume\n\nThe molarity of the HCl solution is given as 2 M, and the volume is 50 mL (0.05 L). Therefore, the moles of HCl are:\n\nmoles = 2 M * 0.05 L = 0.1 mol\n\nSince the balanced chemical equation shows a 1:1 ratio between HCl and NaOH, we can assume that 0.1 mol of NaOH also reacts.\n\nNow we can calculate the enthalpy change (ΔH) per mole of HCl and NaOH reacted. We can do this using the formula:\n\nΔH = q / moles\n\nΔH = 2090 J / 0.1 mol = 20,900 J/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change for the reaction between HCl and NaOH is 20,900 J/mol."
