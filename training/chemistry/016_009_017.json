    "message_2": "To calculate the minimum amount of heat energy required to vaporize 50 grams of water at its boiling point, we can use the formula:\n\nq = n * ΔHvap\n\nwhere q is the heat energy required, n is the number of moles of water, and ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of water (50 grams) to moles. The molar mass of water is 18.015 g/mol, so:\n\nn = mass / molar mass\nn = 50 g / 18.015 g/mol\nn ≈ 2.776 moles\n\nNow, we can use the formula to calculate the heat energy required:\n\nq = n * ΔHvap\nq = 2.776 moles * 40.7 kJ/mol\nq ≈ 112.98 kJ\n\nTherefore, the minimum amount of heat energy required to vaporize 50 grams of water at its boiling point is approximately 112.98 kJ."
