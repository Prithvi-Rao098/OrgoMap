    "message_2": "To determine the amount of nitric acid required, we need to first calculate the moles of 2,4-dinitrophenol needed and then use stoichiometry to find the moles of nitric acid required. Finally, we will convert the moles of nitric acid to mL using the concentration given.\n\n1. Calculate the moles of 2,4-dinitrophenol needed:\nMolecular weight of 2,4-dinitrophenol (C6H3N2O5) = 6(12.01) + 3(1.01) + 2(14.01) + 5(16.00) = 184.11 g/mol\n\nSince the yield is 95%, we need to find the actual amount of 2,4-dinitrophenol that will be synthesized:\nActual mass of 2,4-dinitrophenol = 25 g / 0.95 = 26.32 g\n\nNow, calculate the moles of 2,4-dinitrophenol:\nmoles = mass / molecular weight = 26.32 g / 184.11 g/mol = 0.143 mol\n\n2. Use stoichiometry to find the moles of nitric acid required:\nThe balanced chemical equation for the synthesis of 2,4-dinitrophenol from phenol is:\n\nC6H5OH + 2 HNO3 → C6H3N2O5 + 2 H2O\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 2 moles of nitric acid (HNO3) are required for every mole of 2,4-dinitrophenol produced.\n\nmoles of nitric acid = 0.143 mol (2,4-dinitrophenol) × (2 mol HNO3 / 1 mol 2,4-dinitrophenol) = 0.286 mol\n\n3. Convert the moles of nitric acid to mL using the concentration:\nThe concentration of nitric acid is given as 70%, which means there are 70 g of nitric acid in 100 mL of solution. First, we need to find the molecular weight of nitric acid (HNO3):\n\nMolecular weight of HNO3 = 1.01 + 14.01 + 3(16.00) = 63.02 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the molarity of the 70% nitric acid solution:\nmolarity = (70 g / 100 mL) / 63.02 g/mol = 1.110 mol/L\n\nFinally, we can convert the moles of nitric acid to mL:\nvolume = moles / molarity = 0.286 mol / 1.110 mol/L = 0.257 L = 257 mL\n\nTherefore, 257 mL of 70% nitric acid is required to synthesize 25 g of 2,4-dinitrophenol from phenol, assuming a yield of 95%."
