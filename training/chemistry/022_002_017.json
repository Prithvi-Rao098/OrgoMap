    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the equation:\n\nmoles of acid = moles of base\n\nSince the concentration (M) is defined as moles of solute per liter of solution, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n(concentration of acid) × (volume of acid) = (concentration of base) × (volume of base)\n\nWe are given the concentration and volume of the acid (HCl) and the concentration of the base (NaOH). We need to find the volume of the base (NaOH).\n\n(0.1 M HCl) × (25 mL HCl) = (0.2 M NaOH) × (volume of NaOH)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the volume of HCl from mL to L:\n\n25 mL = 0.025 L\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the equation:\n\n(0.1 M) × (0.025 L) = (0.2 M) × (volume of NaOH)\n\n0.0025 moles = 0.2 M × (volume of NaOH)\n\nTo find the volume of NaOH, divide both sides of the equation by 0.2 M:\n\nvolume of NaOH = 0.0025 moles / 0.2 M = 0.0125 L\n\nNow, convert the volume of NaOH from L to mL:\n\n0.0125 L = 12.5 mL\n\nSo, 12.5 mL of 0.2 M NaOH is required to completely neutralize 25 mL of 0.1 M HCl."
