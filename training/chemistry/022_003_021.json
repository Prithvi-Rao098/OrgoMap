    "message_2": "To calculate the pH of a solution with a concentration of 0.01 M HCl, we can use the formula:\n\npH = -log10[H+]\n\nHCl is a strong acid, which means it completely dissociates in water. Therefore, the concentration of H+ ions in the solution is equal to the concentration of HCl.\n\n[H+] = 0.01 M\n\nNow, we can plug this value into the pH formula:\n\npH = -log10(0.01)\n\npH = -log10(10^-2)\n\npH = 2\n\nThe pH of the solution with a concentration of 0.01 M HCl is 2."
