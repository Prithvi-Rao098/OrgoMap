    "message_2": "First, we need to find the moles of sodium (Na) in the 5.00 grams. To do this, we will use the molar mass of sodium, which is 22.99 g/mol.\n\nmoles of Na = (mass of Na) / (molar mass of Na)\nmoles of Na = 5.00 g / 22.99 g/mol = 0.217 moles\n\nAccording to the balanced chemical equation, 2 moles of Na react with 1 mole of Cl2 to produce 2 moles of NaCl. Since we have 0.217 moles of Na, we can find the moles of NaCl produced:\n\nmoles of NaCl = moles of Na = 0.217 moles\n\nNow, we can find the mass of NaCl produced by using the molar mass of NaCl, which is 58.44 g/mol (22.99 g/mol for Na + 35.45 g/mol for Cl).\n\nmass of NaCl = (moles of NaCl) * (molar mass of NaCl)\nmass of NaCl = 0.217 moles * 58.44 g/mol = 12.67 g\n\nTherefore, 12.67 grams of sodium chloride (NaCl) would be produced from the reaction of 5.00 grams of sodium (Na) with an excess of chlorine (Cl2) gas."
