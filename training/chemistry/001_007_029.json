    "message_2": "The electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction of nitration involves the addition of a nitro group (-NO2) to an aromatic ring, such as benzene. The reagents used in this reaction are nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). The detailed mechanism of this reaction can be described in the following steps:\n\n1. Generation of the electrophile (nitronium ion, NO2+):\nThe first step involves the formation of the electrophile, which is the nitronium ion (NO2+). This is formed by the protonation of nitric acid (HNO3) by sulfuric acid (H2SO4), followed by the loss of a water molecule (H2O).\n\nHNO3 + H2SO4 → NO2+ + H3O+ + HSO4-\n\n2. Electrophilic attack on the aromatic ring:\nThe electrophile, nitronium ion (NO2+), attacks the aromatic ring (benzene) at one of its carbon atoms. This leads to the formation of a positively charged intermediate called a sigma complex or arenium ion. The aromaticity of the benzene ring is disrupted during this step.\n\nBenzene + NO2+ → Sigma complex (arenium ion)\n\n3. Deprotonation and regeneration of aromaticity:\nIn the final step, a proton (H+) is removed from the sigma complex by the bisulfate ion (HSO4-) that was formed in the first step. This restores the aromaticity of the benzene ring and results in the formation of the nitrobenzene product.\n\nSigma complex + HSO4- → Nitrobenzene + H2SO4\n\nOverall, the reaction can be summarized as:\n\nBenzene + HNO3 + H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene + H2O + H2SO4\n\nThis mechanism describes the electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction of nitration using nitric acid and sulfuric acid as the reagents on benzene."
