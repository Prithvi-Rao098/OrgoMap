    "message_2": "The acid-catalyzed hydration of an alkene, such as propene, involves the addition of water across the double bond to form an alcohol. The reaction proceeds through a three-step mechanism involving the formation of a carbocation intermediate. Here is the step-by-step process of the reaction:\n\n1. Protonation of the alkene: In the first step, the alkene (propene) reacts with a strong acid, such as sulfuric acid (H2SO4), to form a protonated alkene. The double bond of the alkene attacks the proton (H+) from the acid, resulting in the formation of a carbocation intermediate. The more stable carbocation will be formed according to Markovnikov's rule, which states that the positive charge will be on the carbon atom with the most hydrogen atoms already attached.\n\nFor propene, the reaction is as follows:\n\nCH3-CH=CH2 + H+ → CH3-CH(+)-CH3\n\n2. Nucleophilic attack by water: In the second step, the carbocation intermediate formed in the first step is attacked by a water molecule, which acts as a nucleophile. The oxygen atom in the water molecule donates a pair of electrons to the positively charged carbon atom, forming a bond between them.\n\nCH3-CH(+)-CH3 + H2O → CH3-CH(OH)-CH3(+)\n\n3. Deprotonation: In the final step, the positively charged oxygen atom in the intermediate formed in the second step is deprotonated by another water molecule, which acts as a base. This results in the formation of the final alcohol product and a hydronium ion (H3O+).\n\nCH3-CH(OH)-CH3(+) + H2O → CH3-CH(OH)-CH3 + H3O+\n\nThe overall reaction is:\n\nCH3-CH=CH2 + H2O (in the presence of H2SO4) → CH3-CH(OH)-CH3\n\nRegarding stereochemistry, the acid-catalyzed hydration of alkenes does not involve any stereospecific process, as the reaction proceeds through a planar carbocation intermediate. However, if the alkene has substituents that can lead to the formation of stereoisomers, the product distribution will depend on the stability of the carbocation intermediate and the steric hindrance during the nucleophilic attack by water. In the case of propene, there is only one possible product, which is 2-propanol (isopropanol)."
