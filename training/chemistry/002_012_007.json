    "message_2": "To determine the bond order and bond length of the nitrogen and carbon atoms in HCN, we first need to analyze the molecule's structure and electron configuration.\n\nHCN has the following Lewis structure:\n\nH - C ≡ N\n\nThe carbon (C) atom forms a triple bond with the nitrogen (N) atom. In a triple bond, there are three shared electron pairs between the two atoms. The bond order can be calculated as:\n\nBond order = (Number of bonding electrons - Number of antibonding electrons) / 2\n\nIn HCN, there are 6 bonding electrons (3 pairs) in the C≡N bond and no antibonding electrons. Therefore, the bond order is:\n\nBond order = (6 - 0) / 2 = 3\n\nThe bond order between the carbon and nitrogen atoms in HCN is 3, indicating a triple bond.\n\nTo determine the bond length, we can refer to experimental data or use a general trend in bond lengths. As a general trend, single bonds are the longest, followed by double bonds, and triple bonds are the shortest. The bond length of a C≡N triple bond is approximately 1.16 Å (angstroms).\n\nIn summary, the bond order between the carbon and nitrogen atoms in HCN is 3, and the bond length is approximately 1.16 Å."
