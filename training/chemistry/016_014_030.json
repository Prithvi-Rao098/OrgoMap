    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat required to sublime 50 grams of dry ice, we need to first determine the number of moles of CO2 present in 50 grams. The molar mass of CO2 is 12.01 g/mol (for carbon) + 2 * 16.00 g/mol (for oxygen) = 44.01 g/mol.\n\nNumber of moles of CO2 = mass / molar mass\nNumber of moles of CO2 = 50 g / 44.01 g/mol = 1.136 moles\n\nNow, we can use the heat of sublimation (25.2 kJ/mol) to calculate the amount of heat required to sublime 1.136 moles of CO2.\n\nHeat required = number of moles * heat of sublimation\nHeat required = 1.136 moles * 25.2 kJ/mol = 28.62 kJ\n\nTherefore, the amount of heat required to sublime 50 grams of dry ice at -78.5°C is 28.62 kJ."
