    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the hydration of MgSO4, we need to find the enthalpy change for the following reaction:\n\nMgSO4(s) + 7H2O(l) → MgSO4 • 7H2O(s)\n\nWe can do this by using Hess's Law, which states that the enthalpy change for a reaction is the same whether it occurs in one step or several steps. In this case, we have two steps with known enthalpy changes:\n\n1) MgSO4(s) → MgSO4(aq) ΔH1 = 44.5 kJ/mol\n2) MgSO4(aq) + 7H2O(l) → MgSO4 • 7H2O(s) ΔH2 = -63.2 kJ/mol\n\nTo find the enthalpy change for the overall reaction, we can simply add the enthalpy changes for these two steps:\n\nΔH_total = ΔH1 + ΔH2\nΔH_total = 44.5 kJ/mol + (-63.2 kJ/mol)\nΔH_total = -18.7 kJ/mol\n\nSo the enthalpy change for the hydration of MgSO4 is -18.7 kJ/mol."
