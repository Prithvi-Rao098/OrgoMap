    "message_2": "To calculate the formal charge on the sulfur atom in the sulfate ion (SO₄²⁻), we can use the following formula:\n\nFormal charge = (Valence electrons of the atom) - (Non-bonding electrons) - (1/2 x Bonding electrons)\n\nSulfur is in group 16 of the periodic table, so it has 6 valence electrons. In the sulfate ion, sulfur is bonded to four oxygen atoms with double bonds. Each double bond consists of 2 bonding electrons, so there are a total of 8 bonding electrons. There are no non-bonding electrons on the sulfur atom in the sulfate ion.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nFormal charge = (6) - (0) - (1/2 x 8)\nFormal charge = 6 - 0 - 4\nFormal charge = +2\n\nThe formal charge on the sulfur atom in the sulfate ion (SO₄²⁻) is +2."
