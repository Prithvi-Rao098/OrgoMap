    "message_1": "What would be the required amount of aniline and chlorine gas to prepare 500g of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline with a yield of 85%?",
    "message_2": "To determine the required amount of aniline and chlorine gas, we need to first find the balanced chemical equation for the reaction. The reaction involves the following steps:\n\n1. Nitration of aniline to form 4-nitroaniline:\n   C6H7N + HNO3 → C6H6N2O2 + H2O\n\n2. Chlorination of 4-nitroaniline to form 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline:\n   C6H6N2O2 + Cl2 → C6H5ClN2O2 + HCl\n\nNow, let's calculate the required amount of aniline and chlorine gas.\n\nFirst, we need to find the molecular weights of the compounds involved:\n\nAniline (C6H7N): 93.13 g/mol\n4-Nitroaniline (C6H6N2O2): 138.12 g/mol\n2-Chloro-4-nitroaniline (C6H5ClN2O2): 172.57 g/mol\nChlorine gas (Cl2): 70.90 g/mol\n\nWe are given that the yield of the reaction is 85%. Therefore, to produce 500g of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline, we need to calculate the amount of reactants needed for the theoretical yield:\n\nTheoretical yield = Actual yield / % yield\nTheoretical yield = 500g / 0.85 = 588.24g\n\nNow, we can use stoichiometry to determine the required amount of aniline and chlorine gas:\n\n1 mol of aniline produces 1 mol of 4-nitroaniline, which in turn produces 1 mol of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline.\n\nMoles of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline = 588.24g / 172.57 g/mol = 3.41 mol\n\nSince the molar ratio is 1:1, we need 3.41 mol of aniline:\n\nMass of aniline = 3.41 mol × 93.13 g/mol = 317.57g\n\nFor the chlorination step, 1 mol of 4-nitroaniline reacts with 1 mol of Cl2 to produce 1 mol of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline. Therefore, we need 3.41 mol of Cl2:\n\nMass of Cl2 = 3.41 mol × 70.90 g/mol = 241.97g\n\nIn conclusion, to prepare 500g of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline with a yield of 85%, we need 317.57g of aniline and 241.97g of chlorine gas."
