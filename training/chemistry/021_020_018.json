    "message_2": "To calculate the heat of formation of methane (CH4) at standard conditions using the bond energy method, we need to consider the bond energies of the reactants and products involved in the formation reaction.\n\nThe formation reaction for methane is:\n\nC(graphite) + 2H2(g) → CH4(g)\n\nWe will use the average bond energies for the bonds involved in this reaction. The bond energies are as follows:\n\nC-H bond energy: 414 kJ/mol\nH-H bond energy: 436 kJ/mol\nC(graphite): Since it is an allotrope of carbon, its energy is considered to be zero.\n\nNow, we will calculate the energy required to break the bonds in the reactants and the energy released when the bonds in the products are formed.\n\nEnergy required to break bonds in reactants:\n2 moles of H2: 2 × 436 kJ/mol = 872 kJ\n\nEnergy released when bonds in products are formed:\n4 moles of C-H bonds: 4 × 414 kJ/mol = 1656 kJ\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat of formation (ΔHf) of methane:\n\nΔHf = Energy required to break bonds - Energy released when bonds are formed\nΔHf = 872 kJ - 1656 kJ\nΔHf = -784 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the heat of formation of methane (CH4) at standard conditions (25°C and 1 atm pressure) using the bond energy method is -784 kJ/mol."
