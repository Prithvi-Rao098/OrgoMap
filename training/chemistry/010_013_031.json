Calculate the value of the electron transfer number and show your work.",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of electrons transferred during the electrochemical reaction, we need to first write the half-reactions for the oxidation of copper and the reduction of silver ions.\n\nOxidation half-reaction (copper):\nCu(s) → Cu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻\n\nReduction half-reaction (silver):\nAg⁺(aq) + e⁻ → Ag(s)\n\nNow, we need to balance the number of electrons in both half-reactions. The least common multiple of the electrons in both half-reactions is 2. So, we will multiply the reduction half-reaction by 2 to balance the electrons:\n\n2[Ag⁺(aq) + e⁻ → Ag(s)]\n\nThis gives us the balanced reduction half-reaction:\n2Ag⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → 2Ag(s)\n\nNow, we can add the balanced half-reactions together to get the overall reaction:\n\nCu(s) + 2Ag⁺(aq) → Cu²⁺(aq) + 2Ag(s)\n\nFrom the balanced overall reaction, we can see that 2 electrons are transferred during the electrochemical reaction of the oxidation of copper metal to form copper ions and the reduction of silver ions to form silver metal. Therefore, the electron transfer number is 2."
