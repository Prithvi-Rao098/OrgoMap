    "message_2": "Le Chatelier's principle states that if a dynamic equilibrium system is subjected to a change in concentration, temperature, or pressure, the system will adjust itself to counteract the change and restore a new equilibrium state.\n\nWhen you add more reactants or products to a reversible reaction at equilibrium, the system will respond by shifting the equilibrium position to counteract the change.\n\n1. If you add more reactants:\nWhen you increase the concentration of reactants, the system will shift the equilibrium position to the right, favoring the forward reaction. This shift will consume the added reactants and produce more products until a new equilibrium is established. \n\nExample: Consider the reversible reaction of nitrogen gas (N2) and hydrogen gas (H2) to form ammonia (NH3):\n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g)\n\nIf you add more N2 or H2 to the system, the equilibrium will shift to the right, producing more NH3 to counteract the increased concentration of reactants.\n\n2. If you add more products:\nWhen you increase the concentration of products, the system will shift the equilibrium position to the left, favoring the reverse reaction. This shift will consume the added products and produce more reactants until a new equilibrium is established.\n\nExample: Using the same reaction as above:\n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g)\n\nIf you add more NH3 to the system, the equilibrium will shift to the left, consuming the added NH3 and producing more N2 and H2 to counteract the increased concentration of products.\n\nIn summary, adding more reactants or products to a reversible reaction at equilibrium will cause the system to shift its equilibrium position to counteract the change, either by favoring the forward or reverse reaction, and establish a new equilibrium state."
