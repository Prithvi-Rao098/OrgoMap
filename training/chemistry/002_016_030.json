The standard entropy change for the reaction of O2(g) to form Al2O3(s) is -159.6 J/K·mol.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change (∆H°) for the reaction, we can use the following formula:\n\n∆H° = Σ [∆Hf°(products)] - Σ [∆Hf°(reactants)]\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\n4Al(s) + 3O2(g) → 2Al2O3(s)\n\n∆H° = [2 × (-1675.7 kJ/mol)] - [4 × (-394.4 kJ/mol) + 3 × (0 kJ/mol)]\n\n∆H° = (-3351.4 kJ) - (-1577.6 kJ)\n\n∆H° = -1773.8 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the reaction is -1773.8 kJ.\n\nNow, let's calculate the standard entropy change (∆S°) for the reaction. The given information states that the standard entropy change for the reaction of O2(g) to form Al2O3(s) is -159.6 J/K·mol. Since there are 3 moles of O2(g) reacting to form 2 moles of Al2O3(s), we can calculate the total standard entropy change for the reaction as follows:\n\n∆S° = (2/3) × (-159.6 J/K·mol)\n\n∆S° = -106.4 J/K·mol\n\nThe standard entropy change for the reaction is -106.4 J/K·mol."
