    "message_2": "The balanced equation for sulfur dioxide formation is:\n\nS (s) + O2 (g) → SO2 (g)\n\nFirst, we need to determine the moles of each reactant. The molar mass of sulfur (S) is 32.07 g/mol, and the molar mass of oxygen (O2) is 32.00 g/mol.\n\nMoles of sulfur = 10 g / 32.07 g/mol = 0.312 moles\nMoles of oxygen = 15 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.469 moles\n\nNow, we need to find the limiting reactant. The stoichiometry of the balanced equation shows that 1 mole of sulfur reacts with 1 mole of oxygen. Therefore, we can compare the mole ratios:\n\nMole ratio of sulfur to oxygen = 0.312 moles / 0.469 moles = 0.665\n\nSince the mole ratio is less than 1, sulfur is the limiting reactant. \n\nNow, we can calculate the amount of sulfur dioxide that can be produced:\n\nMoles of SO2 = moles of limiting reactant (sulfur) = 0.312 moles\n\nThe molar mass of sulfur dioxide (SO2) is 64.07 g/mol.\n\nMass of SO2 = moles of SO2 × molar mass of SO2 = 0.312 moles × 64.07 g/mol = 19.99 g\n\nSo, the student can produce 19.99 grams of sulfur dioxide.\n\nTo find the amount of excess reactant (oxygen), we can use the stoichiometry of the balanced equation:\n\nMoles of oxygen used = moles of sulfur = 0.312 moles\n\nExcess moles of oxygen = initial moles of oxygen - moles of oxygen used = 0.469 moles - 0.312 moles = 0.157 moles\n\nMass of excess oxygen = moles of excess oxygen × molar mass of oxygen = 0.157 moles × 32.00 g/mol = 5.02 g\n\nThe limiting reactant is sulfur, and there are 5.02 grams of excess oxygen."
