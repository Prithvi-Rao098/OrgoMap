    "message_2": "When benzene reacts with concentrated nitric acid in the presence of sulfuric acid as a catalyst, nitrobenzene is formed as the major product. This reaction is known as nitration of benzene. The detailed mechanism for the reaction is as follows:\n\n1. Formation of the electrophile:\nThe sulfuric acid (H2SO4) protonates the nitric acid (HNO3) to form the nitronium ion (NO2+), which acts as the electrophile in this reaction.\nHNO3 + H2SO4 -> NO2+ + HSO4- + H2O\n\n2. Electrophilic aromatic substitution:\nThe electrophile, nitronium ion (NO2+), attacks the benzene ring, which is an electron-rich species due to the delocalized Ï€ electrons. This attack leads to the formation of a resonance-stabilized carbocation called the sigma complex or arenium ion.\n\n3. Deprotonation and regeneration of the catalyst:\nA base, usually the bisulfate ion (HSO4-) formed in the first step, abstracts a proton from the sigma complex, restoring the aromaticity of the benzene ring and forming nitrobenzene as the final product. The sulfuric acid catalyst is regenerated in this step.\n\nOverall reaction:\nC6H6 + HNO3 -> C6H5NO2 + H2O\n\nIn this reaction, benzene (C6H6) reacts with nitric acid (HNO3) to form nitrobenzene (C6H5NO2) and water (H2O) as products."
