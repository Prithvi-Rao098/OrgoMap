    "message_1": "What is the efficiency of an electrochemical cell with a standard potential of 1.5 V if it releases 3000 J of electrical energy during operation with a total of 3500 J of heat energy being released?",
    "message_2": "The efficiency of an electrochemical cell can be calculated using the formula:\n\nEfficiency = (Useful energy output / Total energy input) × 100\n\nIn this case, the useful energy output is the electrical energy released (3000 J), and the total energy input is the sum of the electrical energy and the heat energy released (3000 J + 3500 J = 6500 J).\n\nEfficiency = (3000 J / 6500 J) × 100 = 0.4615 × 100 = 46.15%\n\nThe efficiency of the electrochemical cell is 46.15%."
