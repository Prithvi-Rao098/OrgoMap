    "message_2": "In a molecule with the chemical formula C4H10O, there are two main types of isomerism: structural isomerism (also known as constitutional isomerism) and stereoisomerism. \n\n1. Structural Isomerism: This type of isomerism occurs when the molecules have the same molecular formula but different structural arrangements of atoms. In the case of C4H10O, there are three possible structural isomers:\n\na) Butanol isomers: These have an alcohol functional group (-OH) attached to one of the carbon atoms in a four-carbon chain. There are four possible butanol isomers: 1-butanol, 2-butanol, iso-butanol (2-methyl-1-propanol), and tert-butanol (2-methyl-2-propanol).\n\nb) Diethyl ether (C2H5OC2H5): This is an ether isomer, where an oxygen atom is connected to two ethyl groups.\n\nThe differences between these structural isomers lie in the arrangement of atoms and the functional groups present in the molecule. These differences can lead to variations in physical and chemical properties, such as boiling points, solubility, and reactivity.\n\n2. Stereoisomerism: This type of isomerism occurs when the molecules have the same structural formula but a different spatial arrangement of atoms. In the case of C4H10O, there is only one stereoisomerism possibility:\n\na) Optical isomerism in 2-butanol: 2-butanol has a chiral center at the second carbon atom, which means it can exist as two enantiomers (mirror-image isomers). These enantiomers, (R)-2-butanol and (S)-2-butanol, have the same structural formula but differ in the spatial arrangement of the atoms around the chiral center. Optical isomers can have different effects on plane-polarized light and may exhibit different biological activities.\n\nIn summary, the possible types of isomerism in a molecule with the chemical formula C4H10O are structural isomerism (butanol isomers and diethyl ether) and stereoisomerism (optical isomerism in 2-butanol). The differences between these isomers lie in the arrangement of atoms and functional groups, as well as the spatial arrangement of atoms around chiral centers."
