    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy change for the complete combustion of methane gas (CH4) at constant pressure, we need to use the standard enthalpies of formation for the reactants and products involved in the reaction. The balanced chemical equation for the complete combustion of methane is:\n\nCH4 (g) + 2 O2 (g) → CO2 (g) + 2 H2O (l)\n\nThe standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) for the substances involved are:\n\nΔHf° (CH4, g) = -74.8 kJ/mol\nΔHf° (O2, g) = 0 kJ/mol (since it is an element in its standard state)\nΔHf° (CO2, g) = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔHf° (H2O, l) = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nUsing Hess's Law, we can calculate the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the reaction:\n\nΔH° = [ΔHf° (products)] - [ΔHf° (reactants)]\n\nΔH° = [1 × (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 × (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [1 × (-74.8 kJ/mol) + 2 × 0 kJ/mol]\n\nΔH° = (-393.5 - 571.6 + 74.8) kJ/mol\n\nΔH° = -890.3 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the complete combustion of methane gas (CH4) at constant pressure is -890.3 kJ/mol."
