    "message_2": "To determine the rate of reaction, we need to first write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) and magnesium (Mg) ribbon:\n\nMg + H₂SO₄ → MgSO₄ + H₂\n\nNow, we need to determine the moles of magnesium and sulfuric acid involved in the reaction.\n\nFirst, let's find the moles of magnesium. The length of the magnesium ribbon is given as 2 cm. We need to convert this to mass using the density and molar mass of magnesium.\n\nDensity of magnesium = 1.74 g/cm³\nMolar mass of magnesium = 24.31 g/mol\n\nMass of magnesium = Length × Density\nMass of magnesium = 2 cm × 1.74 g/cm³ = 3.48 g\n\nMoles of magnesium = Mass / Molar mass\nMoles of magnesium = 3.48 g / 24.31 g/mol = 0.143 mol\n\nNext, let's find the moles of sulfuric acid. The concentration and volume of the sulfuric acid solution are given.\n\nConcentration of sulfuric acid = 0.1 M\nVolume of sulfuric acid = 50 mL = 0.050 L (converted to liters)\n\nMoles of sulfuric acid = Concentration × Volume\nMoles of sulfuric acid = 0.1 M × 0.050 L = 0.005 mol\n\nNow, we need to determine the limiting reactant. In this case, it is sulfuric acid, as there are fewer moles of it compared to magnesium.\n\nMoles of H₂SO₄ = 0.005 mol\nMoles of Mg = 0.143 mol\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, the moles of sulfuric acid will react with an equal number of moles of magnesium. Therefore, 0.005 mol of magnesium will react with 0.005 mol of sulfuric acid.\n\nNow, we can calculate the rate of reaction. The reaction takes 30 seconds to complete.\n\nRate of reaction = Moles of limiting reactant / Time\nRate of reaction = 0.005 mol / 30 s = 1.67 × 10⁻⁴ mol/s\n\nThe rate of reaction between sulfuric acid and magnesium ribbon at 25°C is 1.67 × 10⁻⁴ mol/s."
