    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of 1 mole of methane gas (CH₄) under standard conditions, we need to use the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) for each substance involved in the reaction. The standard enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when 1 mole of a substance is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation is:\n\nCH₄(g) + 2O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nThe standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) for each substance are:\n\nΔHf°(CH₄) = -74.8 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(O₂) = 0 kJ/mol (since O₂ is in its standard state)\nΔHf°(CO₂) = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(H₂O) = -241.8 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the reaction (ΔH°) can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nΔH° = Σ [ΔHf°(products)] - Σ [ΔHf°(reactants)]\n\nΔH° = [1 mol × (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 mol × (-241.8 kJ/mol)] - [1 mol × (-74.8 kJ/mol) + 2 mol × 0 kJ/mol]\n\nΔH° = (-393.5 kJ + 2 × -241.8 kJ) - (-74.8 kJ)\n\nΔH° = (-393.5 kJ - 483.6 kJ) + 74.8 kJ\n\nΔH° = -802.3 kJ + 74.8 kJ\n\nΔH° = -727.5 kJ\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of 1 mole of methane gas (CH₄) under standard conditions is -727.5 kJ."
