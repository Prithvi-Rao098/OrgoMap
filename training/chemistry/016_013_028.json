The molar heat of hydration for copper sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO4.5H2O) is -90.1 kJ/mol.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the heat of hydration for the reaction between anhydrous copper sulfate (CuSO4) and water (H2O), we need to first determine the number of moles of CuSO4 used and then use the molar heat of hydration to find the total heat released.\n\n1. Calculate the number of moles of anhydrous CuSO4 used:\n\nThe molar mass of CuSO4 = 63.5 (Cu) + 32.1 (S) + 4 * 16.0 (O) = 159.6 g/mol\n\nGiven mass of CuSO4 = 10 g\n\nNumber of moles of CuSO4 = mass / molar mass = 10 g / 159.6 g/mol = 0.0627 mol\n\n2. Calculate the heat of hydration:\n\nMolar heat of hydration for CuSO4.5H2O = -90.1 kJ/mol\n\nHeat of hydration for 0.0627 mol of CuSO4 = 0.0627 mol * (-90.1 kJ/mol) = -5.65 kJ\n\nThe heat of hydration for the reaction between anhydrous copper sulfate and water is -5.65 kJ."
