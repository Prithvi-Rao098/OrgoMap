    "message_1": "What is the concentration of a copper (II) sulfate solution if its absorbance is measured to be 0.25 using a spectrophotometer with a 1 cm cuvette and a wavelength of 620 nm, assuming a molar absorptivity of 5,400 M^-1cm^-1?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the concentration of the copper (II) sulfate solution, we can use the Beer-Lambert Law, which states:\n\nA = ε * c * l\n\nWhere:\nA = absorbance (0.25)\nε = molar absorptivity (5,400 M^-1cm^-1)\nc = concentration (unknown)\nl = path length of the cuvette (1 cm)\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for the concentration (c):\n\nc = A / (ε * l)\n\nNow, plug in the given values:\n\nc = 0.25 / (5,400 M^-1cm^-1 * 1 cm)\n\nc = 0.25 / 5,400\n\nc = 0.0000463 M\n\nSo, the concentration of the copper (II) sulfate solution is approximately 0.0000463 M or 46.3 µM."
