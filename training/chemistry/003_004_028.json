    "message_2": "To calculate the standard cell potential, we will use the Nernst equation:\n\nE_cell = E°_cell - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\n\nwhere E_cell is the cell potential, E°_cell is the standard cell potential, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin (298 K), n is the number of moles of electrons transferred, F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol), and Q is the reaction quotient.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the half-reactions and their standard reduction potentials:\n\nCu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Cu(s)  E° = +0.34 V\nAg⁺(aq) + e⁻ → Ag(s)  E° = +0.80 V\n\nSince we want the Cu to be oxidized and Ag to be reduced, we will reverse the first half-reaction and subtract its standard reduction potential:\n\nCu(s) → Cu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻  E° = -0.34 V\n\nNow, we can add the two half-reactions to get the overall reaction:\n\nCu(s) + 2Ag⁺(aq) → Cu²⁺(aq) + 2Ag(s)\n\nNext, we can calculate the standard cell potential (E°_cell) by adding the standard reduction potentials of the two half-reactions:\n\nE°_cell = E°_red(Ag⁺) + E°_ox(Cu²⁺) = 0.80 V - 0.34 V = 0.46 V\n\nNow we can calculate the reaction quotient (Q) for the reaction:\n\nQ = [Cu²⁺]/[Ag⁺]² = (0.001 M)/(0.1 M)² = 0.001/0.01 = 0.1\n\nNow we can plug all the values into the Nernst equation:\n\nE_cell = E°_cell - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\nE_cell = 0.46 V - ((8.314 J/mol·K) * (298 K) / (2 * 96,485 C/mol)) * ln(0.1)\nE_cell = 0.46 V - (0.0129 V) * ln(0.1)\nE_cell ≈ 0.46 V + 0.0299 V\nE_cell ≈ 0.49 V\n\nThe standard cell potential of the electrochemical cell at 298 K is approximately 0.49 V."
