    "message_2": "The effect of increasing the temperature on the equilibrium constant (K) for an exothermic reaction can be explained using the Van't Hoff equation:\n\nd(lnK) / d(1/T) = -ΔH°/R\n\nwhere K is the equilibrium constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, ΔH° is the standard enthalpy change of the reaction, and R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K).\n\nFor an exothermic reaction, the enthalpy change (ΔH°) is negative. According to the Van't Hoff equation, if ΔH° is negative, then the relationship between lnK and 1/T is positive. This means that as the temperature (T) increases, the value of 1/T decreases, and the equilibrium constant (K) decreases as well.\n\nLet's consider the formation of a complex ion, such as the formation of hexaaquacopper(II) ion from copper(II) sulfate:\n\nCu²⁺(aq) + 6H₂O(l) ⇌ [Cu(H₂O)₆]²⁺(aq)\n\nAssume that the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) for this reaction is -20 kJ/mol (an arbitrary value for illustration purposes). We can use the Van't Hoff equation to calculate the effect of increasing the temperature on the equilibrium constant (K).\n\nLet's compare the equilibrium constants at two different temperatures: 298 K (25°C) and 323 K (50°C).\n\nFirst, we need to integrate the Van't Hoff equation:\n\n∫(d(lnK)) = -ΔH°/R ∫(d(1/T))\n\nln(K₂/K₁) = -ΔH°/R (1/T₂ - 1/T₁)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nln(K₂/K₁) = -(-20,000 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K) (1/323 K - 1/298 K)\n\nln(K₂/K₁) = 1.47\n\nK₂/K₁ = e¹.⁴⁷ ≈ 4.34\n\nThis result indicates that the equilibrium constant (K) at 50°C (K₂) is approximately 4.34 times smaller than the equilibrium constant at 25°C (K₁). Therefore, increasing the temperature for this exothermic reaction decreases the equilibrium constant (K), which means that the formation of the complex ion is less favorable at higher temperatures."
