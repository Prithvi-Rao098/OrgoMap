    "message_2": "To determine the concentration of chloride ions in a sample of seawater using potentiometry, you will need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Prepare the sample: Collect a representative sample of seawater and filter it to remove any suspended particles.\n\n2. Calibrate the electrode: Use a chloride ion-selective electrode (ISE) and calibrate it with standard solutions of known chloride concentrations. This will help you establish a calibration curve, which will be used to determine the concentration of chloride ions in the seawater sample.\n\n3. Measure the potential: Immerse the chloride ISE and a reference electrode (such as a silver/silver chloride electrode) into the seawater sample. Connect the electrodes to a potentiometer or an ion meter, and measure the potential difference (voltage) between the two electrodes.\n\n4. Determine the concentration: Use the calibration curve obtained in step 2 to convert the measured potential difference into the concentration of chloride ions in the seawater sample.\n\nNote that the concentration of chloride ions in seawater typically ranges from 18,000 to 20,000 mg/L (or 18-20 g/L). However, the actual concentration in your sample may vary depending on the location and time of collection."
