    "message_2": "To determine the hybridization of the central atom in the ammonium (NH4+) ion, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the central atom: In the ammonium ion, the central atom is nitrogen (N).\n\n2. Count the number of atoms bonded to the central atom: Nitrogen is bonded to four hydrogen atoms (H).\n\n3. Count the number of lone pairs on the central atom: In the ammonium ion, nitrogen has no lone pairs because it has a positive charge and has lost one electron to form the ion.\n\n4. Add the number of atoms bonded to the central atom and the number of lone pairs: In this case, 4 (number of hydrogen atoms) + 0 (number of lone pairs) = 4.\n\n5. Determine the hybridization based on the sum from step 4:\n\n- If the sum is 2, the hybridization is sp.\n- If the sum is 3, the hybridization is sp2.\n- If the sum is 4, the hybridization is sp3.\n- If the sum is 5, the hybridization is sp3d.\n- If the sum is 6, the hybridization is sp3d2.\n\nIn the case of the ammonium ion, the sum is 4, so the hybridization of the central nitrogen atom is sp3."
