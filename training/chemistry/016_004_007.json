    "message_2": "To calculate the heat required to raise the temperature of the water, we can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat required, m is the mass of the water, c is the specific heat capacity of water, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nGiven:\nm = 50 g\nc = 4.184 J/g°C\nInitial temperature (T1) = 25°C\nFinal temperature (T2) = 85°C\n\nFirst, we need to find the change in temperature (ΔT):\n\nΔT = T2 - T1\nΔT = 85°C - 25°C\nΔT = 60°C\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat required (q):\n\nq = mcΔT\nq = (50 g)(4.184 J/g°C)(60°C)\nq = 12550.4 J\n\nSo, the heat required to raise the temperature of the 50 g sample of water from 25°C to 85°C is 12,550.4 J."
