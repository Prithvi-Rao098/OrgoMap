    "message_2": "Nucleic acids, such as DNA and RNA, play essential roles in biological systems. They store, transmit, and express genetic information. The structure of nucleic acids can be classified into four levels: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary. Each level of structure has unique characteristics and contributes to the overall function of the nucleic acid.\n\n1. Primary structure: The primary structure of nucleic acids refers to the linear sequence of nucleotides, which are the building blocks of DNA and RNA. Each nucleotide consists of a sugar (deoxyribose in DNA or ribose in RNA), a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base (adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine in DNA; adenine, guanine, cytosine, and uracil in RNA). The primary structure determines the genetic code and is essential for the accurate transmission of genetic information from one generation to the next.\n\n2. Secondary structure: The secondary structure of nucleic acids refers to the local folding and base pairing interactions between nucleotides. In DNA, the secondary structure is the well-known double helix, where two complementary strands of nucleotides pair through hydrogen bonds between the bases (A-T and G-C). In RNA, the secondary structure is more diverse and can include hairpin loops, bulges, and internal loops, resulting from base pairing within a single strand. The secondary structure is crucial for the stability of the nucleic acid and plays a role in processes such as DNA replication and RNA splicing.\n\n3. Tertiary structure: The tertiary structure of nucleic acids refers to the three-dimensional folding and overall shape of the molecule. In DNA, the tertiary structure is generally constrained by the double helix, but it can also form supercoiled and compacted structures, such as chromatin in eukaryotic cells. In RNA, the tertiary structure is more complex and can involve long-range interactions between different regions of the molecule. The tertiary structure is essential for the proper function of the nucleic acid, as it can influence interactions with proteins and other molecules, as well as the accessibility of specific sequences.\n\n4. Quaternary structure: The quaternary structure of nucleic acids refers to the interactions between multiple nucleic acid molecules or between nucleic acids and proteins. Examples of quaternary structures include the ribosome (a complex of RNA and proteins involved in protein synthesis) and the nucleosome (a complex of DNA and histone proteins that helps package DNA in eukaryotic cells). The quaternary structure is critical for the regulation of gene expression and the overall organization of genetic material within cells.\n\nIn summary, the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of nucleic acids are essential for their function in biological systems. Each level of structure contributes to the stability, specificity, and regulation of genetic information, ensuring the accurate transmission and expression of genetic information in living organisms."
