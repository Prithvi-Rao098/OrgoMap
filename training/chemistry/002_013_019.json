    "message_2": "In SF6 (sulfur hexafluoride) molecule, the sulfur atom is the central atom and is surrounded by six fluorine atoms. To determine the hybridization of the sulfur atom, we need to consider its electron configuration and the number of electron domains around it.\n\nSulfur has 6 valence electrons, and each fluorine atom contributes 1 electron, making a total of 12 electrons around the sulfur atom. These 12 electrons are distributed in six electron domains, as there are six single bonds between sulfur and fluorine atoms.\n\nTo accommodate six electron domains, the sulfur atom needs to use one s orbital, three p orbitals, and two d orbitals. Therefore, the hybridization of the sulfur atom in SF6 is sp3d2."
