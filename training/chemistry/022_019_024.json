    "message_2": "To calculate the rate of reaction for the combustion of methane, we first need to determine the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nCH₄(g) + 2O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nNow, we need to find the number of moles of methane (CH₄) that reacted:\n\nMoles of CH₄ = mass of CH₄ / molar mass of CH₄\nMoles of CH₄ = 4.7 g / (12.01 g/mol (C) + 4 * 1.01 g/mol (H))\nMoles of CH₄ = 4.7 g / 16.05 g/mol\nMoles of CH₄ ≈ 0.2928 mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the rate of reaction:\n\nRate of reaction = moles of CH₄ / time\nRate of reaction = 0.2928 mol / 3.5 s\nRate of reaction ≈ 0.0837 mol/s\n\nSo, the rate of reaction for the combustion of methane is approximately 0.0837 mol/s."
