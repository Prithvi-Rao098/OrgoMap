    "message_2": "To calculate the heat of formation of methane (CH4), we need to consider the balanced chemical equation for the formation of methane from its elements in their standard states:\n\nC(graphite) + 2H2(g) → CH4(g)\n\nNow, we can use Hess's Law to find the heat of formation of methane. Hess's Law states that the total enthalpy change for a chemical reaction is the same, regardless of the pathway taken. We can use the given enthalpies of formation to create a pathway to the formation of methane.\n\nFirst, we need to form CH3(g) from its elements:\n\nC(graphite) + 1.5H2(g) → CH3(g)  ΔH1 = 120.6 kJ/mol\n\nNext, we need to add half a mole of H2(g) to CH3(g) to form CH4(g):\n\nCH3(g) + 0.5H2(g) → CH4(g)  ΔH2 = ΔHf (CH4)\n\nNow, we can add these two reactions together to get the overall reaction:\n\nC(graphite) + 2H2(g) → CH4(g)  ΔH = ΔH1 + ΔH2\n\nWe know the enthalpy of formation of H2(g) is 0 kJ/mol, so we can plug in the given values:\n\nΔH = 120.6 kJ/mol + ΔHf (CH4)\n\nNow, we need to find the enthalpy of formation of CH4 (ΔHf (CH4)). To do this, we can use the bond dissociation energies of the C-H and H-H bonds. The bond dissociation energy of a C-H bond is approximately 414 kJ/mol, and the bond dissociation energy of an H-H bond is approximately 436 kJ/mol.\n\nThe formation of CH4 involves breaking two H-H bonds and forming four C-H bonds:\n\n2H2(g) → 4H(g)  ΔH = 2 * 436 kJ/mol = 872 kJ/mol\nC(graphite) + 4H(g) → CH4(g)  ΔH = 4 * (-414 kJ/mol) = -1656 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can find the enthalpy of formation of CH4:\n\nΔHf (CH4) = -1656 kJ/mol + 872 kJ/mol = -784 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the heat of formation of methane (CH4) is -784 kJ/mol."
