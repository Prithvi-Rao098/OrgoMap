    "message_2": "To determine the rate law expression and the overall order of the reaction between iron(III) chloride (FeCl3) and sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3), we need the experimental data collected for this reaction. The experimental data should include the initial concentrations of the reactants and the initial rates of the reaction under different conditions.\n\nOnce we have the experimental data, we can use it to determine the order of the reaction with respect to each reactant and the overall order of the reaction. The rate law expression will be in the form:\n\nRate = k[FeCl3]^m[Na2S2O3]^n\n\nWhere Rate is the initial rate of the reaction, k is the rate constant, [FeCl3] and [Na2S2O3] are the initial concentrations of the reactants, and m and n are the orders of the reaction with respect to FeCl3 and Na2S2O3, respectively.\n\nTo find the values of m and n, we can compare the initial rates and concentrations of the reactants in different experiments. For example, if doubling the concentration of FeCl3 while keeping the concentration of Na2S2O3 constant results in the rate doubling, then the reaction is first order with respect to FeCl3 (m = 1). Similarly, we can determine the order of the reaction with respect to Na2S2O3.\n\nThe overall order of the reaction is the sum of the individual orders (m + n).\n\nPlease provide the experimental data to determine the rate law expression and the overall order of the reaction."
