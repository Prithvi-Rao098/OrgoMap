    "message_2": "To find the bond length between two hydrogen atoms in a hydrogen molecule, we can use the Morse potential equation, which relates the bond energy to the bond length. The equation is as follows:\n\nE(r) = D_e * (1 - exp(-a(r - r_e)))^2\n\nwhere E(r) is the bond energy, D_e is the dissociation energy, a is the Morse potential parameter, r is the bond length, and r_e is the equilibrium bond length.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the bond energy from kJ/mol to J:\n\n436 kJ/mol * (1 mol / 6.022 x 10^23 molecules) * (1000 J / 1 kJ) = 7.24 x 10^-19 J\n\nNext, we need to find the reduced mass (μ) of the hydrogen molecule:\n\nμ = (m1 * m2) / (m1 + m2)\n\nwhere m1 and m2 are the masses of the two hydrogen atoms. Since both hydrogen atoms have the same mass, we can simplify the equation:\n\nμ = (m * m) / (2 * m) = m / 2\n\nNow, we need to convert the mass of a hydrogen atom from atomic mass units (u) to kilograms:\n\n1.008 u * (1.66 x 10^-27 kg / 1 u) = 1.674 x 10^-27 kg\n\nSo, the reduced mass is:\n\nμ = (1.674 x 10^-27 kg) / 2 = 8.37 x 10^-28 kg\n\nNow, we can use the following equation to find the Morse potential parameter (a):\n\na = (2 * π * c * sqrt(μ / (2 * D_e))) / h\n\nwhere c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s), and h is Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 J s). Plugging in the values, we get:\n\na = (2 * π * 2.998 x 10^8 m/s * sqrt((8.37 x 10^-28 kg) / (2 * 7.24 x 10^-19 J))) / (6.626 x 10^-34 J s) = 1.067 x 10^10 m^-1\n\nFinally, we can use the Morse potential equation to find the equilibrium bond length (r_e):\n\n7.24 x 10^-19 J = 7.24 x 10^-19 J * (1 - exp(-1.067 x 10^10 m^-1 * (r - r_e)))^2\n\nSolving for r_e, we get:\n\nr_e ≈ 7.4 x 10^-11 m\n\nSo, the bond length between two hydrogen atoms in a hydrogen molecule is approximately 7.4 x 10^-11 meters or 74 picometers."
