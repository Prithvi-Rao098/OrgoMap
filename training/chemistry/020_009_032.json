    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kp) for the given reaction, we can use the expression:\n\nKp = [NH3]^2 / ([N2] * [H2]^3)\n\nwhere [NH3], [N2], and [H2] represent the partial pressures of NH3, N2, and H2, respectively, at equilibrium.\n\nGiven the partial pressures at equilibrium:\n[N2] = 0.50 atm\n[H2] = 0.50 atm\n[NH3] = 0.10 atm\n\nPlugging these values into the Kp expression:\n\nKp = (0.10)^2 / (0.50 * (0.50)^3)\nKp = 0.01 / (0.50 * 0.125)\nKp = 0.01 / 0.0625\nKp â‰ˆ 0.16\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (Kp) for the reaction at 400 K is approximately 0.16."
