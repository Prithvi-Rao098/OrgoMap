    "message_1": "Given the balanced equation for the electrochemical reaction: \nCu(s) + 2AgNO3(aq) → Cu(NO3)2(aq) + 2Ag(s)\nCalculate the number of electrons transferred per copper atom during this reaction when a current of 5.00 A is passed for 6.00 minutes through a cell containing a copper electrode and a silver electrode with a silver ion concentration of 0.100 M.",
    "message_2": "First, let's determine the number of moles of electrons transferred during the reaction. We can do this by using the formula:\n\nmoles of electrons = (current × time) / Faraday's constant\n\nwhere current is given in amperes (A), time is given in seconds, and Faraday's constant is approximately 96485 C/mol.\n\nGiven the current of 5.00 A and the time of 6.00 minutes, we can convert the time to seconds:\n\n6.00 minutes × 60 seconds/minute = 360 seconds\n\nNow, we can calculate the moles of electrons transferred:\n\nmoles of electrons = (5.00 A × 360 s) / 96485 C/mol ≈ 0.0186 mol\n\nNow, let's determine the stoichiometry of the reaction. From the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of Cu reacts with 2 moles of AgNO3 to produce 1 mole of Cu(NO3)2 and 2 moles of Ag. The number of electrons transferred per copper atom can be determined by looking at the oxidation states of copper in the reaction:\n\nCu(s) has an oxidation state of 0, while Cu(NO3)2 has an oxidation state of +2. This means that each copper atom loses 2 electrons during the reaction. Therefore, the number of electrons transferred per copper atom is 2."
