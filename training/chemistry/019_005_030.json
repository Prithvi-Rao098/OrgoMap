    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the reaction, we need the standard Gibbs free energy of formation (ΔGf°) values for H2(g), O2(g), and H2O(g). The standard Gibbs free energy of formation for H2(g) and O2(g) is zero because they are in their elemental form.\n\nThe standard Gibbs free energy of formation for H2O(g) at 25°C is -228.57 kJ/mol.\n\nUsing the stoichiometry of the balanced equation, we can calculate the Gibbs free energy change for the reaction:\n\nΔG = Σ [ΔGf°(products)] - Σ [ΔGf°(reactants)]\n\nΔG = [2 × ΔGf°(H2O(g))] - [2 × ΔGf°(H2(g)) + ΔGf°(O2(g))]\n\nΔG = [2 × (-228.57 kJ/mol)] - [2 × (0 kJ/mol) + (0 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔG = -457.14 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the reaction 2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(g) at 25°C and 1 bar is -457.14 kJ/mol."
