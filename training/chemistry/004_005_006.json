    "message_2": "To calculate the pH of a 0.1 M solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl), we need to determine the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in the solution. HCl is a strong acid, which means it dissociates completely in water, producing H+ and Cl- ions.\n\nStep 1: Write the dissociation equation for HCl:\nHCl â†’ H+ + Cl-\n\nStep 2: Determine the concentration of H+ ions:\nSince HCl dissociates completely, the concentration of H+ ions will be equal to the concentration of HCl. In this case, the concentration of H+ ions is 0.1 M.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the pH using the pH formula:\npH = -log[H+]\n\nPlug in the concentration of H+ ions:\npH = -log(0.1)\n\nStep 4: Solve for pH:\npH = 1\n\nThe pH of a 0.1 M solution of hydrochloric acid is 1 when measured using a pH meter."
