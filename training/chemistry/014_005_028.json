    "message_2": "The best spectroscopic technique for studying the electronic transitions in transition metal coordination compounds containing a ligand with significant pi-donation properties, such as ethylenediamine or bipyridine ligand, is UV-Visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. This technique is particularly useful for studying the d-d transitions, charge-transfer transitions, and ligand-to-metal charge-transfer (LMCT) transitions in these types of complexes."
