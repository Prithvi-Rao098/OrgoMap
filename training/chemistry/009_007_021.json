    "message_1": "What is the half-life of Americium-241 if it undergoes alpha decay to become Neptunium-237? Given that the initial amount of Americium-241 was 200 grams, how much Americium-241 will remain after 500 years?",
    "message_2": "The half-life of Americium-241 (Am-241) is 432.2 years. To determine how much Am-241 will remain after 500 years, we can use the formula:\n\nFinal amount = Initial amount * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial amount is 200 grams, the time elapsed is 500 years, and the half-life is 432.2 years. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal amount = 200 * (1/2)^(500 / 432.2)\n\nFinal amount ≈ 200 * (1/2)^(1.1568)\n\nFinal amount ≈ 200 * 0.4136\n\nFinal amount ≈ 82.72 grams\n\nAfter 500 years, approximately 82.72 grams of Americium-241 will remain."
