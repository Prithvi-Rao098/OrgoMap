    "message_2": "To calculate the pH of a 0.05 M solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl), we need to use the formula:\n\npH = -log10[H+]\n\nHydrochloric acid is a strong acid, which means it completely dissociates in water. Therefore, the concentration of hydrogen ions [H+] in the solution will be equal to the concentration of the HCl.\n\n[H+] = 0.05 M\n\nNow, we can plug this value into the pH formula:\n\npH = -log10(0.05)\n\npH â‰ˆ 1.3\n\nSo, the pH of a 0.05 M solution of hydrochloric acid is approximately 1.3."
