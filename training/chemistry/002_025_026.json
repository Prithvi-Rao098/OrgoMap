    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic moment of the cobalt(II) chloride complex [CoCl4]2-, we first need to determine the number of unpaired electrons in the complex.\n\nCobalt(II) has an electron configuration of [Ar] 3d7 4s2. In the [CoCl4]2- complex, cobalt is in the +2 oxidation state, which means it loses two electrons. The electron configuration of Co(II) is [Ar] 3d7.\n\nThe [CoCl4]2- complex is a tetrahedral complex, which means it has a coordination number of 4. In a tetrahedral complex, the crystal field splitting energy is not large enough to force pairing of the electrons in the 3d orbitals. Therefore, the electrons will remain unpaired.\n\nIn the 3d7 configuration, there are 3 unpaired electrons.\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic moment (µ) using the formula:\n\nµ = √(n(n+2)) µB\n\nwhere n is the number of unpaired electrons and µB is the Bohr magneton (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T).\n\nµ = √(3(3+2)) µB\nµ = √(3(5)) µB\nµ = √15 µB\n\nThe magnetic moment of the cobalt(II) chloride complex [CoCl4]2- is approximately √15 µB."
