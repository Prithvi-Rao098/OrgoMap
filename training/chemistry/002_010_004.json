    "message_2": "To find the density of aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃), we can use the formula:\n\nDensity = mass/volume\n\nGiven the mass of the sample is 25.0 g and the volume it occupies is 13.5 cm³, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nDensity = (25.0 g) / (13.5 cm³)\n\nDensity ≈ 1.85 g/cm³\n\nSo, the density of aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) is approximately 1.85 g/cm³."
