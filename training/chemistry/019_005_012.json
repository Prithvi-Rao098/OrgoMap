    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG = ΔG(products) - ΔG(reactants)\n\nFirst, we need to find the Gibbs free energy of the products and reactants. Since ΔGf°(H2) and ΔGf°(O2) are both 0 kJ/mol, we only need to consider the Gibbs free energy of formation for H2O.\n\nFor the reactants, we have 2 moles of H2O:\nΔG(reactants) = 2 * ΔGf°(H2O) = 2 * (-237.13 kJ/mol) = -474.26 kJ/mol\n\nFor the products, we have 2 moles of H2 and 1 mole of O2, but their ΔGf° values are 0, so:\nΔG(products) = 2 * ΔGf°(H2) + ΔGf°(O2) = 2 * 0 kJ/mol + 0 kJ/mol = 0 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the Gibbs free energy change for the reaction:\nΔG = ΔG(products) - ΔG(reactants) = 0 kJ/mol - (-474.26 kJ/mol) = 474.26 kJ/mol\n\nThe Gibbs free energy change for the reaction 2H2O (l) → 2H2 (g) + O2 (g) at 298 K is 474.26 kJ/mol."
