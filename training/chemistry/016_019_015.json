    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of adsorption of hydrogen gas on activated carbon, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH_ads = ΔH_gas - ΔH_abs\n\nwhere ΔH_ads is the enthalpy of adsorption, ΔH_gas is the molar enthalpy of hydrogen gas, and ΔH_abs is the enthalpy of absorption.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the enthalpy of absorption (ΔH_abs). We can use the ideal gas law to find the work done by the gas during the absorption process:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for V:\n\nV = nRT / P\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nV = (0.025 moles) * (8.314 J/mol·K) * (298 K) / (1 atm * 101.325 J/L·atm)\n\nV ≈ 0.0614 L\n\nNow, we can calculate the work done by the gas (W):\n\nW = -PΔV\n\nSince the gas is absorbed by the activated carbon, the final volume is 0, so ΔV = -0.0614 L. Plugging in the values:\n\nW = -(1 atm * 101.325 J/L·atm) * (-0.0614 L)\n\nW ≈ 6.22 J\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy of absorption (ΔH_abs):\n\nΔH_abs = ΔU + W\n\nSince the process is isothermal (constant temperature), the change in internal energy (ΔU) is 0. Therefore:\n\nΔH_abs = 0 + 6.22 J\n\nΔH_abs ≈ 6.22 J\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy of adsorption (ΔH_ads):\n\nΔH_ads = ΔH_gas - ΔH_abs\n\nThe molar enthalpy of hydrogen gas is given as -285.8 kJ/mol, so for 0.025 moles, it is:\n\nΔH_gas = -285.8 kJ/mol * 0.025 moles = -7.145 kJ\n\nConverting ΔH_abs to kJ:\n\nΔH_abs ≈ 6.22 J * (1 kJ / 1000 J) = 0.00622 kJ\n\nNow, we can find ΔH_ads:\n\nΔH_ads = -7.145 kJ - 0.00622 kJ\n\nΔH_ads ≈ -7.151 kJ\n\nSo, the enthalpy of adsorption of hydrogen gas on activated carbon is approximately -7.151 kJ."
