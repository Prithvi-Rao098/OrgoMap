The melting point of NaCl is 801 °C and the density of the solid NaCl is 2.16 g/cm³.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the heat of crystallization for NaCl, we need to determine the heat released when NaCl transitions from its liquid state to its solid state at its melting point. We can use the following equation:\n\nΔH_crystallization = -ΔH_fusion\n\nwhere ΔH_crystallization is the heat of crystallization, and ΔH_fusion is the enthalpy of fusion.\n\nWe are given the enthalpy of fusion of NaCl as 28.3 kJ/mol. Therefore, the heat of crystallization is:\n\nΔH_crystallization = -28.3 kJ/mol\n\nThe heat of crystallization for NaCl is -28.3 kJ/mol. This means that 28.3 kJ of heat is released per mole of NaCl when it crystallizes from its liquid state to its solid state at its melting point."
