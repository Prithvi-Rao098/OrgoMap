    "message_2": "In KMnO4, the oxidation state of manganese (Mn) can be determined by considering the oxidation states of the other elements in the compound and the overall charge of the compound.\n\nPotassium (K) has an oxidation state of +1, and oxygen (O) typically has an oxidation state of -2.\n\nThe compound KMnO4 is neutral, so the sum of the oxidation states of all the elements in the compound should equal zero.\n\nLet x be the oxidation state of manganese (Mn). Then, the equation for the sum of the oxidation states is:\n\n(+1) + x + 4(-2) = 0\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx - 7 = 0\n\nx = +7\n\nSo, the oxidation state of manganese (Mn) in KMnO4 is +7."
