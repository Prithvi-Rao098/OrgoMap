    "message_1": "What is the solubility of sodium chloride (NaCl) in water at 25°C, and how does it compare to the solubility of magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) in water at the same temperature?",
    "message_2": "The solubility of sodium chloride (NaCl) in water at 25°C is approximately 36 grams per 100 grams of water. This means that at 25°C, you can dissolve 36 grams of NaCl in 100 grams of water before the solution becomes saturated.\n\nThe solubility of magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) in water at 25°C is approximately 35.1 grams per 100 grams of water. This means that at 25°C, you can dissolve 35.1 grams of MgSO4 in 100 grams of water before the solution becomes saturated.\n\nComparing the solubility of NaCl and MgSO4 at 25°C, they are quite similar, with NaCl being slightly more soluble in water than MgSO4."
