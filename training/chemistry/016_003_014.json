    "message_2": "To calculate the bond dissociation energy of the N-N bond in N2O4, we need to consider the enthalpy change for the given reaction and the bond dissociation energy of the N-O bond in NO2.\n\nThe given reaction is:\n2N2O4(g) --> 4NO2(g)  ΔH = -109.7 kJ/mol\n\nFirst, we need to find the bond dissociation energy of the N-O bond in NO2. The enthalpy change for the dissociation of one mole of NO2 is given by the following reaction:\n\nNO2(g) --> NO(g) + 0.5O2(g)  ΔH = +33.18 kJ/mol\n\nNow, let's consider the dissociation of one mole of N2O4 into NO2 and N2:\n\nN2O4(g) --> N2(g) + 2NO2(g)\n\nTo find the enthalpy change for this reaction, we can use the enthalpy change for the given reaction and the enthalpy change for the dissociation of one mole of NO2:\n\nΔH(N2O4) = 0.5 * ΔH(2N2O4) - 2 * ΔH(NO2)\nΔH(N2O4) = 0.5 * (-109.7 kJ/mol) - 2 * (+33.18 kJ/mol)\nΔH(N2O4) = -54.85 kJ/mol - 66.36 kJ/mol\nΔH(N2O4) = -121.21 kJ/mol\n\nThe bond dissociation energy of the N-N bond in N2O4 is equal to the enthalpy change for the dissociation of one mole of N2O4:\n\nBond dissociation energy (N-N) = -ΔH(N2O4) = 121.21 kJ/mol"
