    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic moment of a complex, we need to know the number of unpaired electrons present in the central metal ion. In this case, the central metal ion is iron(II), which has an oxidation state of +2.\n\nThe electronic configuration of iron (Fe) is [Ar] 3d^6 4s^2. When it forms the Fe(II) ion, it loses two electrons, resulting in the electronic configuration [Ar] 3d^6.\n\nIn an octahedral complex, the d orbitals split into two sets: the lower energy t2g orbitals (dxy, dyz, and dxz) and the higher energy eg orbitals (dz^2 and dx^2-y^2). The ligand in this complex is chloride (Cl^-), which is a weak field ligand. This means that the energy difference between the t2g and eg orbitals is relatively small, and the complex exhibits high-spin configuration.\n\nFor high-spin Fe(II), the six d-electrons will fill the orbitals as follows:\n\n1. t2g (dxy) - 1 electron\n2. t2g (dyz) - 1 electron\n3. t2g (dxz) - 1 electron\n4. eg (dz^2) - 1 electron\n5. eg (dx^2-y^2) - 1 electron\n6. t2g (dxy) - 1 electron\n\nAs we can see, there are four unpaired electrons in the high-spin Fe(II) complex.\n\nThe magnetic moment (μ) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nμ = √(n(n+2)),\n\nwhere n is the number of unpaired electrons.\n\nFor this complex, n = 4, so:\n\nμ = √(4(4+2))\nμ = √(4(6))\nμ = √(24)\n\nThe magnetic moment of the complex is √24 Bohr magnetons (BM)."
