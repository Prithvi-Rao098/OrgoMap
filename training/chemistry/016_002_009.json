Here's a question for a chemistry student to solve in the topic of Hess's Law calculations:\n\nGiven the following equations and their respective enthalpy changes:\n\n2CH4(g) + 3O2(g) → 2CO2(g) + 4H2O(g)          ∆H1 = -1652 kJ/mol \nCO2(g) + H2(g) → CH4(g) + O2(g)                   ∆H2 = 247 kJ/mol \n2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(g)                             ∆H3 = -572 kJ/mol\n\nCalculate the enthalpy change (∆H) for the reaction: \n\n2CO(g) + O2(g) → 2CO2(g)\n\nUsing the equations above and applying Hess's Law.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Hess's Law, we need to manipulate the given equations in such a way that when they are added together, they result in the target equation: 2CO(g) + O2(g) → 2CO2(g). \n\nFirst, let's reverse the second equation and change the sign of its enthalpy change:\n\nCH4(g) + O2(g) → CO2(g) + H2(g)                   ∆H2' = -247 kJ/mol\n\nNow, let's multiply the third equation by 2 to get 4 moles of H2:\n\n4H2(g) + 2O2(g) → 4H2O(g)                             ∆H3' = -1144 kJ/mol\n\nNext, we'll add the first, modified second, and modified third equations together:\n\n2CH4(g) + 3O2(g) → 2CO2(g) + 4H2O(g)          ∆H1 = -1652 kJ/mol\nCH4(g) + O2(g) → CO2(g) + H2(g)                   ∆H2' = -247 kJ/mol\n4H2(g) + 2O2(g) → 4H2O(g)                             ∆H3' = -1144 kJ/mol\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n2CH4(g) + 4H2(g) → 2CO(g) + O2(g) + 2CO2(g) \n\nNow, we can cancel out the common terms on both sides of the equation:\n\n2CH4(g) + 4H2(g) → 2CO(g) + O2(g) + 2CO2(g) \n-2CH4(g) - 4H2(g) + 2CO(g) + O2(g) + 2CO2(g) = 0\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n2CO(g) + O2(g) → 2CO2(g)\n\nNow that we have the target equation, we can add the enthalpy changes of the modified equations to find the enthalpy change for the target equation:\n\n∆H = ∆H1 + ∆H2' + ∆H3'\n∆H = -1652 kJ/mol + (-247 kJ/mol) + (-1144 kJ/mol)\n∆H = -3043 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the enthalpy change for the reaction 2CO(g) + O2(g) → 2CO2(g) is -3043 kJ/mol."
