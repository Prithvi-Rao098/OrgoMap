    "message_1": "A sample of radioactive material with an initial activity of 80 Ci has a half-life of 10 days. What will be the activity of the sample after 30 days?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the radioactive decay formula:\n\nActivity_final = Activity_initial * (1/2)^(time_elapsed / half_life)\n\nwhere Activity_final is the activity of the sample after the given time, Activity_initial is the initial activity of the sample, time_elapsed is the time that has passed, and half_life is the half-life of the radioactive material.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nActivity_initial = 80 Ci\nhalf_life = 10 days\ntime_elapsed = 30 days\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nActivity_final = 80 Ci * (1/2)^(30 days / 10 days)\n\nActivity_final = 80 Ci * (1/2)^3\n\nActivity_final = 80 Ci * (1/8)\n\nActivity_final = 10 Ci\n\nSo, the activity of the sample after 30 days will be 10 Ci."
