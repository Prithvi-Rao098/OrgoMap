    "message_2": "The addition reaction between an alkene and hydrogen bromide (HBr) in the presence of peroxide (ROOR) follows a radical mechanism known as the \"anti-Markovnikov\" addition. This reaction is also called the \"peroxide effect\" or \"Kharasch effect.\" The mechanism involves the following steps:\n\n1. Initiation: The reaction begins with the homolytic cleavage of the peroxide (ROOR) by heat or light, generating two alkoxy radicals (RO•).\n\nROOR → 2 RO•\n\n2. Reaction of the alkoxy radical with HBr: The alkoxy radical reacts with HBr, breaking the H-Br bond and generating a bromine radical (Br•) and an alcohol (ROH).\n\nRO• + HBr → ROH + Br•\n\n3. Reaction of the bromine radical with the alkene: The bromine radical reacts with the alkene, forming a new carbon-bromine bond and generating a carbon-centered radical at the less substituted carbon of the alkene (anti-Markovnikov position).\n\nBr• + RCH=CHR' → RCHBr•-CHR'\n\n4. Reaction of the carbon-centered radical with HBr: The carbon-centered radical reacts with another HBr molecule, forming a new carbon-hydrogen bond and regenerating the bromine radical.\n\nRCHBr•-CHR' + HBr → RCHBr-CH(R')Br + Br•\n\n5. Termination: The reaction can be terminated by the combination of two radicals, such as the bromine radical and the carbon-centered radical, or by the reaction of the bromine radical with the alkoxy radical.\n\nBr• + RCHBr•-CHR' → RCHBr-CH(R')Br\nBr• + RO• → ROBr\n\nOverall, the reaction results in the anti-Markovnikov addition of HBr to the alkene, with the bromine atom attaching to the less substituted carbon and the hydrogen atom attaching to the more substituted carbon."
