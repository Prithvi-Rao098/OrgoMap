    "message_2": "When hydrogen gas (H2) is reacted with an alkene or an alkyne in the presence of a platinum (Pt) catalyst, the reaction that occurs is called hydrogenation. In this reaction, the carbon-carbon double or triple bond is reduced by adding hydrogen atoms across the bond.\n\nThe difference in reactivity between an alkene and an alkyne in this reaction lies in the number of hydrogen molecules required and the number of steps involved in the reaction.\n\n1. Alkene hydrogenation: Alkenes have a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). When an alkene reacts with hydrogen gas in the presence of a platinum catalyst, one molecule of hydrogen (H2) is added across the double bond, converting it into an alkane with a single bond (C-C). This reaction is relatively fast and occurs in a single step.\n\n2. Alkyne hydrogenation: Alkynes have a carbon-carbon triple bond (Câ‰¡C). When an alkyne reacts with hydrogen gas in the presence of a platinum catalyst, two molecules of hydrogen (2 H2) are added across the triple bond. The reaction occurs in two steps: first, the triple bond is reduced to a double bond (forming an alkene), and then the double bond is further reduced to a single bond (forming an alkane). The hydrogenation of alkynes is slower than that of alkenes due to the two-step process and the stronger carbon-carbon triple bond.\n\nIn summary, the reactivity difference between an alkene and an alkyne when reacted with hydrogen gas in the presence of a platinum catalyst is that the alkene reacts faster and requires only one hydrogen molecule, while the alkyne reacts slower and requires two hydrogen molecules."
