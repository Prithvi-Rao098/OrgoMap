    "message_2": "To determine the rate law for the given reaction, we need to consider the information provided about the initial rate of disappearance of NO and the effect of changing the concentration of H2.\n\nThe general form of a rate law is:\n\nRate = k[NO]^m[H2]^n\n\nwhere k is the rate constant, m and n are the orders of the reaction with respect to NO and H2, respectively.\n\nWe are given that the initial rate of disappearance of NO is directly proportional to the concentration of NO and H2. This means that the reaction is at least first order with respect to both NO and H2. So, initially, we can write:\n\nRate = k[NO]^1[H2]^1\n\nNow, we are given that when the concentration of H2 is reduced to half while keeping the concentration of NO constant, the rate is halved. Let's analyze this situation:\n\nInitial rate: Rate₁ = k[NO]^1[H2]^1\nNew rate (halved): Rate₂ = 0.5 * Rate₁ = 0.5 * k[NO]^1[H2]^1\n\nNow, the new rate with half the concentration of H2:\nRate₂ = k[NO]^1[0.5H2]^1\n\nComparing the two expressions for Rate₂:\n\n0.5 * k[NO]^1[H2]^1 = k[NO]^1[0.5H2]^1\n\nWe can cancel out k[NO]^1 from both sides:\n\n0.5[H2]^1 = [0.5H2]^1\n\nThis confirms that the reaction is first order with respect to both NO and H2. Therefore, the rate law for the given reaction is:\n\nRate = k[NO]^1[H2]^1 or Rate = k[NO][H2]"
