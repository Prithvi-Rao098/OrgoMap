    "message_2": "To find the percent composition of the compound, we first need to determine the molar mass of the empirical formula CCl.\n\nMolar mass of Carbon (C) = 12.01 g/mol\nMolar mass of Chlorine (Cl) = 35.45 g/mol\n\nMolar mass of CCl = 12.01 g/mol (C) + 35.45 g/mol (Cl) = 47.46 g/mol\n\nNow, we need to find the ratio between the molar mass of the compound (98.96 g/mol) and the empirical formula (CCl, 47.46 g/mol).\n\nRatio = (Molar mass of compound) / (Molar mass of empirical formula)\nRatio = 98.96 g/mol / 47.46 g/mol ≈ 2.08\n\nSince the ratio is approximately 2, the molecular formula of the compound is C2Cl2.\n\nNow, we can find the percent composition of the compound.\n\nPercent composition of Carbon (C) = (2 * 12.01 g/mol) / (98.96 g/mol) * 100\nPercent composition of Carbon (C) ≈ 24.25 %\n\nPercent composition of Chlorine (Cl) = (2 * 35.45 g/mol) / (98.96 g/mol) * 100\nPercent composition of Chlorine (Cl) ≈ 75.75 %\n\nThe percent composition of the compound C2Cl2 is approximately 24.25% Carbon and 75.75% Chlorine."
