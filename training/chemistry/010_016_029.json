    "message_1": "Calculate the polarization potential in an electrochemical cell if the concentration of zinc ions in the anode compartment is 0.5 M, the concentration of copper(II) ions in the cathode compartment is 1.0 M, and the voltage of the cell is 1.1 V. The standard reduction potential of copper(II) ions is +0.34 V and the standard reduction potential of zinc ions is -0.76 V.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the polarization potential in an electrochemical cell, we need to use the Nernst equation:\n\nE_cell = E°_cell - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\n\nWhere:\nE_cell = cell potential (voltage) under non-standard conditions\nE°_cell = cell potential (voltage) under standard conditions\nR = gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\nT = temperature (in Kelvin, assuming 298 K or 25°C)\nn = number of electrons transferred in the redox reaction (2 for the Cu²⁺/Zn²⁺ redox couple)\nF = Faraday's constant (96,485 C/mol)\nQ = reaction quotient, which is the ratio of the concentrations of the products to the reactants\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard cell potential (E°_cell):\n\nE°_cell = E°_cathode - E°_anode\nE°_cell = (+0.34 V) - (-0.76 V)\nE°_cell = 1.10 V\n\nNow, we can calculate the reaction quotient (Q):\n\nQ = [Zn²⁺]/[Cu²⁺]\nQ = (0.5 M)/(1.0 M)\nQ = 0.5\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Nernst equation:\n\nE_cell = 1.10 V - (8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K) / (2 * 96,485 C/mol) * ln(0.5)\nE_cell = 1.10 V - (0.0257 V) * ln(0.5)\nE_cell = 1.10 V - (-0.0179 V)\nE_cell = 1.1179 V\n\nThe polarization potential in the electrochemical cell is approximately 0.0179 V (1.1179 V - 1.10 V)."
