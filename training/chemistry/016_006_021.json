    "message_1": "A certain chemical reaction has a delta H value of -120 kJ/mol. If 2.5 moles of this reactant undergo the reaction, how much energy is released or absorbed by the reaction?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the energy released or absorbed by the reaction, we can use the following formula:\n\nEnergy = (delta H) * (moles of reactant)\n\nIn this case, delta H is -120 kJ/mol and the number of moles of reactant is 2.5 moles. So, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nEnergy = (-120 kJ/mol) * (2.5 moles)\n\nEnergy = -300 kJ\n\nSince the energy value is negative, it indicates that the reaction is exothermic and 300 kJ of energy is released by the reaction."
