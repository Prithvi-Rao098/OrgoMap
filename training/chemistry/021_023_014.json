    "message_2": "Stereoisomers and structural isomers are two types of isomers that differ in the arrangement of atoms or groups within a molecule. Isomers are molecules with the same molecular formula but different arrangements of atoms in space.\n\n1. Structural isomers (also known as constitutional isomers) have different connectivity of atoms, meaning the order in which atoms are bonded to each other is different. They have the same molecular formula but different structural formulas. Structural isomers can be further classified into chain isomers, positional isomers, and functional group isomers.\n\n2. Stereoisomers have the same connectivity of atoms, meaning the order in which atoms are bonded to each other is the same, but they differ in the spatial arrangement of these atoms. Stereoisomers can be further classified into two main types: enantiomers and diastereomers. Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, while diastereomers are not mirror images of each other.\n\nTo determine whether a given molecule exhibits either type of isomerism, one should first analyze the connectivity of atoms within the molecule. If the connectivity is different, the molecule exhibits structural isomerism. If the connectivity is the same but the spatial arrangement of atoms is different, the molecule exhibits stereoisomerism.\n\nLet's consider a molecule with the molecular formula C4H10. There are two possible isomers for this molecule:\n\n1. n-Butane: CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3\n2. Isobutane (or 2-methylpropane): (CH3)3CH\n\nThese two molecules have the same molecular formula but different connectivity of atoms, so they are structural isomers (specifically, chain isomers).\n\nNow, let's consider a molecule with the molecular formula C4H8O2. One possible structure is a carboxylic acid, butanoic acid:\n\n1. Butanoic acid: CH3-CH2-CH2-COOH\n\nAnother possible structure is an ester, methyl ethanoate:\n\n2. Methyl ethanoate: CH3-O-CO-CH3\n\nThese two molecules have the same molecular formula but different connectivity of atoms and different functional groups (carboxylic acid and ester), so they are structural isomers (specifically, functional group isomers).\n\nFinally, let's consider a molecule with the molecular formula C4H10O. One possible structure is an alcohol, 2-butanol:\n\n1. (R)-2-butanol: CH3-CH(OH)-CH3-CH3\n2. (S)-2-butanol: CH3-CH(OH)-CH3-CH3\n\nThese two molecules have the same connectivity of atoms but differ in the spatial arrangement of the hydroxyl group (-OH) around the chiral center (the carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group). They are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they are stereoisomers (specifically, enantiomers)."
