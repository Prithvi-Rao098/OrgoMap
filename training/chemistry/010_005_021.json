Given that the standard reduction potential of Cu2+/Cu is +0.34 V and that of Zn2+/Zn is -0.76 V at 298 K.",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (K) for the electrochemical cell, we first need to determine the standard cell potential (E°cell) and then use the Nernst equation to relate it to the equilibrium constant.\n\nThe standard cell potential can be calculated by subtracting the standard reduction potential of the anode (E°anode) from the standard reduction potential of the cathode (E°cathode):\n\nE°cell = E°cathode - E°anode\n\nGiven the standard reduction potentials of Cu2+/Cu (+0.34 V) and Zn2+/Zn (-0.76 V), we can calculate the standard cell potential:\n\nE°cell = (+0.34 V) - (-0.76 V) = +1.10 V\n\nNow, we can use the Nernst equation to relate the standard cell potential to the equilibrium constant. The Nernst equation is:\n\nE°cell = (RT/nF) * ln(K)\n\nwhere R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin (298 K), n is the number of electrons transferred in the redox reaction (2 in this case), F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol), and K is the equilibrium constant.\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for K, we get:\n\nK = exp(nFE°cell/RT)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nK = exp(2 * 96,485 C/mol * 1.10 V / (8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K))\n\nK = exp(213,067 / 2,459)\n\nK = exp(86.64)\n\nK ≈ 7.9 × 10^37\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant for the given electrochemical cell is approximately 7.9 × 10^37."
