    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant (K) for the formation of the complex ion Cu(NH3)42+, we need to use the spectroscopic data provided. The spectroscopic data should include the absorbance (A) of the solution at a specific wavelength, which can be used to determine the concentration of the complex ion formed.\n\nFirst, let's write the balanced chemical equation for the formation of the complex ion:\n\nCu2+ + 4NH3 ⇌ Cu(NH3)42+\n\nNow, let's assume that x moles of Cu(NH3)42+ are formed at equilibrium. The change in concentration for each species can be represented as follows:\n\nCu2+: 0.02 - x\nNH3: 0.5 - 4x\nCu(NH3)42+: x\n\nNext, we need to use the Beer-Lambert Law to relate the absorbance (A) to the concentration of the complex ion formed. The Beer-Lambert Law is given by:\n\nA = ε * l * c\n\nwhere A is the absorbance, ε is the molar absorptivity, l is the path length, and c is the concentration of the complex ion.\n\nUsing the spectroscopic data provided, we can determine the concentration of the complex ion (x) at equilibrium. Once we have the concentration of the complex ion, we can calculate the equilibrium constant (K) using the expression:\n\nK = [Cu(NH3)42+] / ([Cu2+] * [NH3]^4)\n\nSubstitute the concentrations of the species at equilibrium:\n\nK = (x) / ((0.02 - x) * (0.5 - 4x)^4)\n\nNow, solve for K using the calculated concentration of the complex ion (x) from the spectroscopic data. This will give you the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex ion Cu(NH3)42+ in the given solution at room temperature."
