    "message_2": "Increasing the pH of a solution involves increasing the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH-) and decreasing the concentration of hydronium ions (H3O+). In the context of the equilibrium reaction Fe3+(aq) + SCN-(aq) ⇌ FeSCN2+(aq), we need to consider how the pH change affects the concentrations of the species involved in the reaction.\n\nFe3+ ions can react with hydroxide ions to form insoluble iron(III) hydroxide (Fe(OH)3) precipitate:\n\nFe3+(aq) + 3OH-(aq) ⇌ Fe(OH)3(s)\n\nAs the pH increases, the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH-) increases, which will shift the above equilibrium to the right, forming more Fe(OH)3 precipitate and decreasing the concentration of Fe3+ ions in the solution.\n\nAccording to Le Chatelier's principle, when a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in concentration, temperature, or pressure, the system will adjust itself to counteract the change and restore a new equilibrium. In this case, the decrease in Fe3+ concentration due to the formation of Fe(OH)3 will cause the equilibrium of the complex ion formation reaction to shift to the left:\n\nFe3+(aq) + SCN-(aq) ⇌ FeSCN2+(aq)\n\nThis shift to the left will result in the formation of more Fe3+ and SCN- ions and a decrease in the concentration of FeSCN2+ complex ions. Consequently, the complex ion formation between Fe3+ and SCN- will be less favored at higher pH values.\n\nIn summary, increasing the pH of the solution will decrease the formation of the complex ion between Fe3+ and SCN- due to the decrease in Fe3+ concentration caused by the formation of Fe(OH)3 precipitate. The position of the equilibrium reaction will shift to the left, resulting in a lower concentration of FeSCN2+ complex ions in the solution. This observation is in accordance with Le Chatelier's principle."
