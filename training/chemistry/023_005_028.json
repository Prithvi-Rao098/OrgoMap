    "message_2": "The synthesis of ibuprofen from 2-methylpropylbenzene and carbon dioxide involves several steps, with different conditions and catalysts required for each step. Here's an overview of the process:\n\n1. Friedel-Crafts Alkylation: The first step is the alkylation of the benzene ring in 2-methylpropylbenzene (also known as isobutylbenzene) using propionyl chloride. This reaction requires a Lewis acid catalyst, typically aluminum chloride (AlCl3) or iron(III) chloride (FeCl3). The reaction is carried out at a temperature of around 80°C. The intermediate compound produced in this step is 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanoyl chloride.\n\n2. Hydrolysis: The next step is the hydrolysis of the acyl chloride group in the intermediate compound to form a carboxylic acid. This can be achieved by adding water to the reaction mixture and heating it to around 100°C. The intermediate compound produced in this step is 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionic acid, which is also known as α-methyl-4-(2-methylpropyl)benzeneacetic acid.\n\n3. Carboxylation: In this step, carbon dioxide (CO2) is introduced to the reaction mixture to form a new carboxylic acid group. The reaction is carried out under high pressure (around 30 atm) and high temperature (around 150°C). A transition metal catalyst, such as palladium (Pd) or nickel (Ni) on a support like activated carbon or alumina, is used to facilitate the carboxylation. The intermediate compound produced in this step is 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)butyric acid.\n\n4. Decarboxylation: The final step is the decarboxylation of the 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)butyric acid to form ibuprofen. This reaction requires heating the reaction mixture to around 230°C in the presence of a strong base, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or potassium hydroxide (KOH). The decarboxylation results in the loss of a carbon dioxide molecule and the formation of the final product, ibuprofen.\n\nIn summary, the successful synthesis of ibuprofen from 2-methylpropylbenzene and carbon dioxide requires a series of reactions with different conditions and catalysts, including Lewis acids (AlCl3 or FeCl3), transition metal catalysts (Pd or Ni), and strong bases (NaOH or KOH). The intermediate compounds produced during the process are 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanoyl chloride, 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionic acid, and 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)butyric acid."
