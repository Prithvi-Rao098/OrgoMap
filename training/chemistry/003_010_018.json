    "message_2": "To calculate the weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of the polymer sample, we can use the following formula:\n\nMw = Î£(wi * Mi)\n\nwhere wi is the weight fraction of the polymer with molecular weight Mi.\n\nGiven the weight fractions and molecular weights of the two polymers in the sample:\n\nw1 = 0.2 (for M1 = 30,000 g/mol)\nw2 = 0.8 (for M2 = 10,000 g/mol)\n\nMw = (0.2 * 30,000) + (0.8 * 10,000)\nMw = 6,000 + 8,000\nMw = 14,000 g/mol\n\nNow, we can use the polydispersity index (PDI) to verify our result. The PDI is the ratio of the weight-average molecular weight (Mw) to the number-average molecular weight (Mn):\n\nPDI = Mw / Mn\n\nGiven that the PDI is 1.5 and Mn is 20,000 g/mol:\n\n1.5 = Mw / 20,000\nMw = 1.5 * 20,000\nMw = 30,000 g/mol\n\nHowever, this result contradicts our previous calculation of Mw (14,000 g/mol). There seems to be an inconsistency in the given information. Please double-check the provided data and ensure it is accurate."
