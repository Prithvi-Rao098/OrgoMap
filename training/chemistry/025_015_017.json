    "message_2": "Schools with limited resources can still provide chemistry students with engaging extracurricular activities to enhance their learning and interest in the subject by utilizing low-cost materials, collaborating with other schools or organizations, and leveraging online resources. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. Science clubs: Establish a chemistry club where students can participate in hands-on experiments and activities using low-cost and easily accessible materials. Many experiments can be conducted using household items or inexpensive chemicals.\n\n2. Collaborate with local organizations: Partner with local universities, research institutions, or industries to organize workshops, seminars, or field trips. These organizations may be willing to provide resources, expertise, or even host events for students.\n\n3. Online resources: Utilize free online resources such as educational videos, virtual labs, and interactive simulations to supplement classroom learning. Websites like Khan Academy, PhET Interactive Simulations, and the Royal Society of Chemistry offer a wealth of resources for students to explore chemistry concepts.\n\n4. Science competitions: Encourage students to participate in local, regional, or national science competitions such as science fairs, Science Olympiad, or Chemistry Olympiad. These events can motivate students to delve deeper into chemistry topics and develop their problem-solving skills.\n\n5. Guest speakers: Invite local scientists, researchers, or professionals in the field of chemistry to give talks or demonstrations at the school. This can expose students to real-world applications of chemistry and inspire them to pursue careers in the field.\n\n6. DIY lab equipment: Use everyday items or low-cost materials to create simple lab equipment for hands-on experiments. For example, students can build their own spectroscope using a cardboard box, a CD, and a small slit.\n\n7. Collaborate with other schools: Partner with nearby schools to share resources, expertise, or organize joint events. This can help reduce costs and provide students with a broader range of experiences.\n\n8. Community outreach: Organize community events or workshops where students can showcase their chemistry projects or experiments. This not only engages students but also raises awareness about the importance of chemistry in everyday life.\n\n9. Mentorship programs: Pair students with mentors from local universities or industries who can provide guidance, support, and inspiration for students interested in pursuing chemistry-related careers.\n\n10. Encourage self-directed learning: Provide students with resources and guidance to explore chemistry topics on their own, such as independent research projects or online courses. This can help foster a lifelong interest in the subject."
