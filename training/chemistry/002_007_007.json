    "message_2": "When magnesium sulfate (MgSO₄) reacts with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), the products formed are magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)₂) and sodium sulfate (Na₂SO₄). The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nMgSO₄ (aq) + 2 NaOH (aq) → Mg(OH)₂ (s) + Na₂SO₄ (aq)\n\nIn this reaction, the spectator ions are the ions that do not participate in the reaction and remain unchanged. They are sodium (Na⁺) and sulfate (SO₄²⁻) ions."
