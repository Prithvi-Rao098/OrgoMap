(Hint: The heat of sublimation of a substance is equal to the sum of its enthalpy of fusion and enthalpy of vaporization.)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the heat of sublimation of solid carbon dioxide (dry ice), we need to add the enthalpy of fusion and the enthalpy of vaporization.\n\nEnthalpy of fusion = 8.6 kJ/mol\nEnthalpy of vaporization = 22.8 kJ/mol\n\nHeat of sublimation = Enthalpy of fusion + Enthalpy of vaporization\nHeat of sublimation = 8.6 kJ/mol + 22.8 kJ/mol\nHeat of sublimation = 31.4 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the heat of sublimation of solid carbon dioxide (dry ice) is 31.4 kJ/mol."
