    "message_1": "What hybrid orbitals are present in the molecule CH4, and what is the bond angle between each of the hydrogen atoms?",
    "message_2": "In the molecule CH4 (methane), the central atom is carbon. Carbon has 4 valence electrons, and it forms 4 sigma bonds with 4 hydrogen atoms. To accommodate these 4 bonds, carbon undergoes sp3 hybridization, which means it has four sp3 hybrid orbitals.\n\nThe bond angle between each of the hydrogen atoms in a methane molecule is approximately 109.5 degrees. This is due to the tetrahedral arrangement of the sp3 hybrid orbitals, which allows for the most stable and least repulsive configuration of the electron pairs around the central carbon atom."
