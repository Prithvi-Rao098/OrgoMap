    "message_2": "To calculate the formal charge of nitrogen in ammonia (NH3), we can use the following formula:\n\nFormal charge = (Valence electrons of the atom) - (Non-bonding electrons) - 0.5 * (Bonding electrons)\n\nIn the case of nitrogen (N), it has 5 valence electrons. In ammonia, nitrogen forms 3 single covalent bonds with 3 hydrogen atoms, which means it has 6 bonding electrons (2 electrons per bond). Nitrogen has no non-bonding electrons (lone pairs) in ammonia.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nFormal charge of N = (5) - (0) - 0.5 * (6)\nFormal charge of N = 5 - 0 - 3\nFormal charge of N = 2\n\nTherefore, the formal charge of nitrogen in ammonia (NH3) is 0."
