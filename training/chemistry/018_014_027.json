    "message_2": "In a first-order reaction, the reaction rate is directly proportional to the concentration of one of the reactants. This means that if the concentration of the reactant is doubled, the reaction rate will also double. The relationship between the reaction rate and the concentration of the reactant can be represented by the following rate law equation:\n\nRate = k[A]^1\n\nwhere Rate is the reaction rate, k is the rate constant, and [A] is the concentration of the reactant.\n\nExperimental evidence supporting this relationship can be found in numerous studies. One classic example is the hydrolysis of ethyl acetate, a first-order reaction. In this reaction, ethyl acetate (CH3COOC2H5) reacts with water (H2O) to form acetic acid (CH3COOH) and ethanol (C2H5OH):\n\nCH3COOC2H5 + H2O â†’ CH3COOH + C2H5OH\n\nTo study the effect of changing the concentration of ethyl acetate on the reaction rate, a series of experiments can be performed with varying initial concentrations of ethyl acetate while keeping the concentration of water constant. The reaction rate can be monitored by measuring the formation of acetic acid or ethanol over time.\n\nThe results of these experiments would show that the reaction rate increases linearly with the increase in the concentration of ethyl acetate. This linear relationship confirms that the reaction is first-order with respect to ethyl acetate.\n\nIn conclusion, the change in concentration of reactants in a first-order reaction directly affects the reaction rate. Experimental evidence, such as the hydrolysis of ethyl acetate, supports this relationship, demonstrating that the reaction rate increases linearly with the increase in the concentration of the reactant."
