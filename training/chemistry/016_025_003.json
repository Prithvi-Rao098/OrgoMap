The density of water is 1.00 g/mL and the heat capacity of the solution is 4.18 J/g째C. The molar mass of NaCl is 58.44 g/mol and its enthalpy of dissolution is -3.9 kJ/mol.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the dissolution of 10.0 grams of sodium chloride (NaCl) in 100 mL of water at 25째C, we will first determine the number of moles of NaCl and then use the enthalpy of dissolution to find the total enthalpy change.\n\n1. Calculate the number of moles of NaCl:\nmoles of NaCl = mass of NaCl / molar mass of NaCl\nmoles of NaCl = 10.0 g / 58.44 g/mol\nmoles of NaCl = 0.171 mol\n\n2. Calculate the enthalpy change for the dissolution of NaCl:\nenthalpy change = moles of NaCl * enthalpy of dissolution\nenthalpy change = 0.171 mol * (-3.9 kJ/mol)\nenthalpy change = -0.667 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change for the dissolution of 10.0 grams of sodium chloride in 100 mL of water at 25째C is -0.667 kJ."
