    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of solution, we first need to find the heat (q) released or absorbed during the dissolving process. We can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere m is the mass of the solution (in grams), c is the heat capacity of the solution (in J/g°C), and ΔT is the change in temperature (in °C).\n\nFirst, let's find the mass of the solution. We are given the mass of NaOH (10.0 g) and the mass of water (100.0 g). The mass of the solution is the sum of these two masses:\n\nm_solution = m_NaOH + m_water\nm_solution = 10.0 g + 100.0 g\nm_solution = 110.0 g\n\nNext, we need to find the change in temperature. We are given the initial temperature (25°C) and the final temperature (28.5°C). The change in temperature is:\n\nΔT = T_final - T_initial\nΔT = 28.5°C - 25°C\nΔT = 3.5°C\n\nNow we can find the heat (q) released or absorbed during the dissolving process:\n\nq = mcΔT\nq = (110.0 g)(4.18 J/g°C)(3.5°C)\nq = 1610.3 J\n\nSince the temperature of the solution increased, the dissolving process is exothermic, and the heat is released. Therefore, q = -1610.3 J.\n\nNow we need to find the enthalpy of solution (ΔH_solution) in kJ/mol. We can use the formula:\n\nΔH_solution = q / n\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of NaOH.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of moles of NaOH. The molar mass of NaOH is:\n\nM_NaOH = 22.99 g/mol (Na) + 15.999 g/mol (O) + 1.007 g/mol (H)\nM_NaOH = 39.996 g/mol\n\nNow we can find the number of moles of NaOH:\n\nn = mass / molar_mass\nn = 10.0 g / 39.996 g/mol\nn = 0.250 mol\n\nNow we can find the enthalpy of solution:\n\nΔH_solution = q / n\nΔH_solution = -1610.3 J / 0.250 mol\nΔH_solution = -6441.2 J/mol\n\nSince we need the answer in kJ/mol, we can convert it:\n\nΔH_solution = -6.441 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy of solution for dissolving 10.0 g of NaOH in 100.0 g of water at 25°C is -6.441 kJ/mol."
