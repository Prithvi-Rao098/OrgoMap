    "message_2": "To calculate the energy of a gamma photon emitted in a gamma decay process, we need to know the frequency (ν) of the photon. However, the information provided (atomic number 68 and mass number 169) is not sufficient to determine the frequency of the emitted gamma photon. \n\nGamma decay processes involve the emission of a gamma photon from an excited nucleus, and the energy of the emitted photon depends on the specific energy levels involved in the transition. These energy levels are unique to each isotope and are not solely determined by the atomic number and mass number.\n\nIf you can provide the specific isotope and the energy levels involved in the gamma decay process, we can then calculate the energy of the emitted gamma photon using the equation E = hν, where h is Planck's constant (approximately 4.135667696 × 10^-15 eV·s)."
