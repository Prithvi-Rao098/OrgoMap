    "message_2": "To calculate the total binding energy of a Carbon-12 nucleus, we first need to find the individual binding energies for each nucleon (protons and neutrons). Carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. The atomic mass of Carbon-12 is 12.0000 amu (atomic mass units).\n\n1. First, we need to convert the atomic mass of Carbon-12 to mass in kilograms:\n1 amu = 1.66053906660 × 10^(-27) kg\n12.0000 amu × 1.66053906660 × 10^(-27) kg/amu = 1.99264687992 × 10^(-26) kg\n\n2. Next, we need to find the mass of 6 protons and 6 neutrons:\nMass of 1 proton = 1.007276466812 amu\nMass of 1 neutron = 1.008664915 amu\n\nMass of 6 protons = 6 × 1.007276466812 amu = 6.043658800872 amu\nMass of 6 neutrons = 6 × 1.008664915 amu = 6.05198949 amu\n\nTotal mass of 12 nucleons = 6.043658800872 amu + 6.05198949 amu = 12.095648290872 amu\n\n3. Convert the total mass of 12 nucleons to mass in kilograms:\n12.095648290872 amu × 1.66053906660 × 10^(-27) kg/amu = 2.00942620792 × 10^(-26) kg\n\n4. Calculate the mass defect (Δm) by subtracting the mass of Carbon-12 nucleus from the total mass of 12 nucleons:\nΔm = 2.00942620792 × 10^(-26) kg - 1.99264687992 × 10^(-26) kg = 1.67793280000 × 10^(-28) kg\n\n5. Calculate the total binding energy (E) using Einstein's mass-energy equivalence formula, E = Δm × c^2, where c is the speed of light (2.99792458 × 10^8 m/s):\nE = 1.67793280000 × 10^(-28) kg × (2.99792458 × 10^8 m/s)^2 = 4.51572000000 × 10^(-12) J\n\n6. Convert the total binding energy from joules to MeV (1 J = 6.242 × 10^12 MeV):\nE = 4.51572000000 × 10^(-12) J × 6.242 × 10^12 MeV/J = 28.194 MeV\n\n7. Calculate the binding energy per nucleon by dividing the total binding energy by the number of nucleons (12 for Carbon-12):\nBinding energy per nucleon = 28.194 MeV / 12 = 2.3495 MeV/nucleon\n\nThe total binding energy of Carbon-12 nucleus is 28.194 MeV, and the binding energy per nucleon is 2.3495 MeV/nucleon."
