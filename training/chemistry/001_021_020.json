    "message_2": "When 1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane undergoes an E1 mechanism of elimination, a carbocation is formed as an intermediate. The bromine atom leaves, creating a carbocation at the 1-position. Then, a hydrogen atom is removed from a neighboring carbon (either at the 3-position or the 6-position) by a base, leading to the formation of an alkene.\n\nThere are two possible products formed in this reaction due to the two different positions where the hydrogen can be removed:\n\n1. If the hydrogen is removed from the 3-position, the product formed is 1-methylcyclohexene.\n2. If the hydrogen is removed from the 6-position, the product formed is 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\nBoth products are formed as a mixture, with 1-methylcyclohexene being the major product due to the more stable trans-alkene configuration."
