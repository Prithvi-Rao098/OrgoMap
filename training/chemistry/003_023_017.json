    "message_2": "To calculate the heat released during the combustion of 5 grams of propane, we first need to determine the number of moles of propane in 5 grams. The molecular weight of propane (C3H8) is:\n\n(3 * 12.01) + (8 * 1.01) = 36.03 + 8.08 = 44.11 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the number of moles of propane in 5 grams:\n\n5 g / 44.11 g/mol = 0.1133 moles\n\nSince the enthalpy change of combustion of propane is -2220 kJ/mol, we can calculate the heat released during the combustion of 0.1133 moles of propane:\n\nHeat released = (0.1133 moles) * (-2220 kJ/mol) = -251.3 kJ\n\nTherefore, the heat released during the combustion of 5 grams of propane at constant volume is approximately -251.3 kJ."
