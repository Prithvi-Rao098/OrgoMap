    "message_2": "To calculate the power output of an electrochemical cell, we can use the formula:\n\nPower (P) = Voltage (V) × Current (I)\n\nGiven the standard potential (voltage) of the cell is +0.34 V and the current flowing through it is 2.5 A, we can calculate the power output as follows:\n\nP = 0.34 V × 2.5 A\nP = 0.85 W (watts)\n\nNow, we need to find the total energy output over the 3-hour period. We can do this by using the formula:\n\nEnergy (E) = Power (P) × Time (t)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the time from hours to seconds:\n\n3 hours × (60 minutes/hour) × (60 seconds/minute) = 10,800 seconds\n\nNow, we can calculate the total energy output:\n\nE = 0.85 W × 10,800 s\nE = 9,180 J (joules)\n\nSo, the power output of the electrochemical cell is 0.85 W, and the total energy output over the 3-hour period is 9,180 J."
