    "message_2": "To calculate the pH of the buffer solution, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n\nFirst, we need to find the pKa value, which is the negative logarithm of the dissociation constant (Ka):\n\npKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.8 × 10^-5) ≈ 4.74\n\nSince we are combining equal volumes of 0.1 M acetic acid (HA) and 0.1 M sodium acetate (A-), their concentrations will remain the same in the buffer solution:\n\n[HA] = 0.1 M\n[A-] = 0.1 M\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = 4.74 + log(0.1/0.1)\n\nSince the ratio of [A-] to [HA] is 1, the log term becomes 0:\n\npH = 4.74 + 0\n\nSo, the pH of the buffer solution is:\n\npH = 4.74"
