    "message_2": "To calculate the rate constant (k) for the polymerization of styrene, we can use the rate law equation for a first-order reaction:\n\nrate = k [styrene]\n\nwhere rate is the rate of polymerization, k is the rate constant, and [styrene] is the initial concentration of styrene.\n\nWe are given the rate of polymerization (2.21 x 10^-3 mol L^-1 s^-1) and the initial concentration of styrene (0.02 mol L^-1). Plugging these values into the rate law equation, we can solve for k:\n\n2.21 x 10^-3 mol L^-1 s^-1 = k (0.02 mol L^-1)\n\nk = (2.21 x 10^-3 mol L^-1 s^-1) / (0.02 mol L^-1)\nk = 1.105 x 10^-1 s^-1\n\nNow that we have the rate constant (k) at 60°C, we can calculate the activation energy (Ea) using the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk = A * exp(-Ea / R * T)\n\nwhere k is the rate constant, A is the pre-exponential factor, Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant (8.314 J mol^-1 K^-1), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nWe are given the activation energy (Ea = 101 kJ mol^-1 = 101,000 J mol^-1) and the temperature (60°C = 333.15 K). We can rearrange the Arrhenius equation to solve for A:\n\nA = k / exp(-Ea / R * T)\n\nPlugging in the values for k, Ea, R, and T:\n\nA = (1.105 x 10^-1 s^-1) / exp(-101,000 J mol^-1 / (8.314 J mol^-1 K^-1 * 333.15 K))\nA ≈ 1.105 x 10^-1 s^-1 / exp(-36.53)\nA ≈ 1.105 x 10^-1 s^-1 / 1.33 x 10^-16\nA ≈ 8.31 x 10^14 s^-1\n\nNow we have the pre-exponential factor (A) and the activation energy (Ea). The rate constant (k) for the polymerization of styrene at 60°C is 1.105 x 10^-1 s^-1, and the activation energy is 101 kJ mol^-1."
