    "message_2": "The standard enthalpy change for the fusion of solid hydrogen (H₂) at its melting point can be calculated using the given standard enthalpy of fusion. In this case, the standard enthalpy of fusion is already provided as 0.117 kJ/mol.\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the fusion of solid hydrogen (H₂) at its melting point of 13.81 K is 0.117 kJ/mol."
