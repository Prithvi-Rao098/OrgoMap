    "message_1": "What is the yield of 4-bromoacetanilide that can be obtained when 5 grams of acetanilide and 10 mL of bromine are used in the synthesis reaction?",
    "message_2": "To determine the yield of 4-bromoacetanilide, we first need to find the limiting reactant in the reaction. The balanced chemical equation for the synthesis of 4-bromoacetanilide is:\n\nC8H9NO + Br2 â†’ C8H8BrNO + HBr\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of each reactant:\n\n1. Acetanilide (C8H9NO) has a molar mass of 135.17 g/mol.\n5 g of acetanilide / 135.17 g/mol = 0.0370 mol of acetanilide\n\n2. Bromine (Br2) has a molar mass of 159.81 g/mol. The density of liquid bromine is 3.12 g/mL.\n10 mL of bromine * 3.12 g/mL = 31.2 g of bromine\n31.2 g of bromine / 159.81 g/mol = 0.195 mol of bromine\n\nNow, we need to find the limiting reactant by comparing the mole ratios:\n\nAcetanilide to bromine ratio: 0.0370 mol / 0.195 mol = 0.189\n\nSince the ratio is less than 1, acetanilide is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow, we can find the theoretical yield of 4-bromoacetanilide:\n\nThe molar mass of 4-bromoacetanilide (C8H8BrNO) is 214.06 g/mol.\n0.0370 mol of acetanilide * (1 mol of 4-bromoacetanilide / 1 mol of acetanilide) * 214.06 g/mol = 7.92 g\n\nThe theoretical yield of 4-bromoacetanilide is 7.92 g. However, the actual yield will likely be lower due to side reactions, losses during purification, and other factors. To find the actual yield, you would need to perform the reaction and measure the mass of the product obtained."
