    "message_2": "The electrophilic addition reaction of water (H2O) with propene (C3H6) is an example of acid-catalyzed hydration. The reaction involves the addition of a water molecule across the double bond of propene, resulting in the formation of a secondary alcohol, propan-2-ol (C3H8O). The mechanism of this reaction occurs in three main steps:\n\n1. Protonation of the double bond:\nThe reaction is typically carried out in the presence of a strong acid catalyst, such as sulfuric acid (H2SO4) or phosphoric acid (H3PO4). The acid donates a proton (H+) to the double bond of propene, creating a carbocation intermediate. The protonation step is regioselective and follows Markovnikov's rule, which states that the proton will add to the carbon with the most hydrogen atoms already attached. In this case, the proton adds to the terminal carbon, resulting in a secondary carbocation.\n\n2. Nucleophilic attack by water:\nThe carbocation intermediate is electrophilic and attracts the nucleophilic water molecule. The oxygen atom in water donates a pair of electrons to form a bond with the carbocation, resulting in a protonated alcohol intermediate.\n\n3. Deprotonation:\nAnother water molecule acts as a base and abstracts a proton from the protonated alcohol intermediate, regenerating the acid catalyst and forming the final product, propan-2-ol.\n\nOverall, the electrophilic addition reaction of water with propene proceeds through an acid-catalyzed mechanism, resulting in the formation of propan-2-ol as the major product."
