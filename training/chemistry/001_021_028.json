    "message_2": "The major product obtained when 1-chlorobutane is treated with sodium ethoxide in ethanol is 1-butene. This reaction is an example of an elimination reaction, specifically E2 elimination.\n\nThe reason for the formation of 1-butene predominantly is due to the strong base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), which is present in the reaction. Sodium ethoxide is an alkoxide ion (RO-) derived from ethanol (EtOH). In this reaction, the ethoxide ion acts as a base and abstracts a β-hydrogen from the 1-chlorobutane molecule. The β-hydrogen is the hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbon attached to the chlorine atom.\n\nThe E2 elimination mechanism involves a concerted process, where the ethoxide ion abstracts the β-hydrogen, and the electrons from the C-H bond form a double bond between the α- and β-carbon atoms. Simultaneously, the C-Cl bond breaks, and the electrons from the bond go to the chlorine atom, forming a chloride ion (Cl-). This leads to the formation of 1-butene as the major product.\n\nThe E2 elimination is favored in this reaction due to the strong, sterically unhindered base (ethoxide ion) and the primary alkyl halide (1-chlorobutane). The reaction conditions promote the elimination pathway over other possible substitution reactions (like SN2)."
