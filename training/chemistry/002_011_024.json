    "message_2": "The geometry of the SiCl4 (Silicon tetrachloride) molecule is tetrahedral. In a tetrahedral molecular geometry, a central atom is located at the center with four substituents (in this case, four chlorine atoms) that are located at the corners of a tetrahedron. The bond angles in a tetrahedral molecule are approximately 109.5 degrees.\n\nAs for the polarity of SiCl4, it is a nonpolar molecule. Although the Si-Cl bond is polar due to the difference in electronegativity between Silicon (1.90) and Chlorine (3.16), the overall molecule is nonpolar. This is because the four polar bonds are symmetrically arranged around the central silicon atom, and their dipoles cancel each other out, resulting in a net dipole moment of zero."
