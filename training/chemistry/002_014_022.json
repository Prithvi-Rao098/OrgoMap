    "message_2": "To calculate the formal charge of the sulfur atom in the sulfate ion (SO4^2-), we can use the following formula:\n\nFormal charge = (Valence electrons of the atom) - (Non-bonding electrons) - 0.5 * (Bonding electrons)\n\nSulfur is in group 6A of the periodic table, so it has 6 valence electrons. In the sulfate ion, sulfur is bonded to four oxygen atoms through double bonds. Each double bond consists of 2 bonding electrons, so there are a total of 8 bonding electrons involved in the double bonds.\n\nSince sulfur is using all its valence electrons for bonding, there are no non-bonding electrons.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nFormal charge of S = (6) - (0) - 0.5 * (8)\nFormal charge of S = 6 - 4\nFormal charge of S = +2\n\nSo, the formal charge of the sulfur atom in the SO4^2- ion is +2."
