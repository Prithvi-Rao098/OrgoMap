    "message_2": "To calculate the standard molar entropy change (∆S°) for the reaction, we can use the Gibbs free energy equation:\n\n∆G° = ∆H° - T∆S°\n\nWhere ∆G° is the standard Gibbs free energy change, ∆H° is the standard enthalpy change, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ∆S° is the standard entropy change.\n\nAt equilibrium, the Gibbs free energy change is zero:\n\n0 = ∆H° - T∆S°\n\nWe are given the standard molar enthalpy change (∆H°) as -572 kJ/mol and the temperature (T) as 298 K. We can rearrange the equation to solve for the standard molar entropy change (∆S°):\n\n∆S° = ∆H° / T\n\nFirst, we need to convert the enthalpy change from kJ/mol to J/mol:\n\n∆H° = -572 kJ/mol × (1000 J/1 kJ) = -572,000 J/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard molar entropy change:\n\n∆S° = (-572,000 J/mol) / (298 K) = -1919.46 J/mol·K\n\nThe standard molar entropy change for the reaction is approximately -1919.46 J/mol·K."
