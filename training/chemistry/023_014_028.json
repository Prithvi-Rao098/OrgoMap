    "message_2": "To determine the optimum amount of bromine required for the preparation of 4-bromoacetanilide from acetanilide, we need to consider the stoichiometry of the reaction. The balanced equation for the bromination of acetanilide is:\n\nC8H9NO + Br2 â†’ C8H8BrNO + HBr\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that one mole of acetanilide reacts with one mole of bromine to produce one mole of 4-bromoacetanilide.\n\nFirst, let's determine the amount of acetanilide in grams. To do this, we need to know the molecular weight of acetanilide:\n\nAcetanilide (C8H9NO) = (12.01 * 8) + (1.01 * 9) + 14.01 + 16.00 = 135.17 g/mol\n\nNow, let's assume we have 1 mole of acetanilide (135.17 g) for this reaction. According to the stoichiometry, we need 1 mole of bromine:\n\nBromine (Br2) = (79.90 * 2) = 159.80 g/mol\n\nSo, the optimum amount of bromine required for the preparation of 4-bromoacetanilide from 1 mole (135.17 g) of acetanilide is 1 mole (159.80 g) of bromine.\n\nNow, let's determine the theoretical yield of 4-bromoacetanilide. The molecular weight of 4-bromoacetanilide is:\n\n4-Bromoacetanilide (C8H8BrNO) = (12.01 * 8) + (1.01 * 8) + 79.90 + 14.01 + 16.00 = 214.07 g/mol\n\nSince the reaction has a 1:1 stoichiometry, the theoretical yield of 4-bromoacetanilide from 1 mole of acetanilide is also 1 mole:\n\n1 mole of 4-bromoacetanilide = 214.07 g\n\nHowever, in practice, the reaction may not have a 100% yield due to side reactions, loss of product during purification, or other factors. The actual yield will depend on the specific conditions and techniques used in the experiment."
