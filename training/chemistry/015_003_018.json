    "message_2": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a linear molecule with three vibrational modes: symmetric stretching, bending, and asymmetric stretching. The quantum mechanical approach to determine the vibrational frequencies and infrared spectrum involves solving the Schr√∂dinger equation for the vibrational motion of the molecule.\n\nUsing the quantum mechanical approach, the vibrational frequencies for CO2 are calculated as follows:\n\n1. Symmetric stretching (v1): ~1286 cm^-1\n2. Bending (v2): ~667 cm^-1\n3. Asymmetric stretching (v3): ~2349 cm^-1\n\nThese values are approximate and may vary depending on the specific method used for calculation.\n\nThe infrared spectrum of CO2 consists of peaks corresponding to the vibrational frequencies. However, due to the selection rules in infrared spectroscopy, only the bending mode (v2) and the asymmetric stretching mode (v3) are active, meaning they can be observed in the infrared spectrum. The symmetric stretching mode (v1) is not active and does not appear in the spectrum.\n\nWhen comparing the calculated vibrational frequencies to experimental data, there is generally good agreement. The experimental values for the vibrational frequencies of CO2 are:\n\n1. Symmetric stretching (v1): ~1286 cm^-1\n2. Bending (v2): ~667 cm^-1\n3. Asymmetric stretching (v3): ~2349 cm^-1\n\nThese values are close to the calculated values, indicating that the quantum mechanical approach provides a reasonably accurate description of the vibrational frequencies and infrared spectrum of CO2. However, more advanced computational methods and inclusion of anharmonic effects can further improve the accuracy of these calculations."
