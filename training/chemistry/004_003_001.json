    "message_2": "To determine the molecular formula of an unknown organic compound using mass spectrometry data, you will need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the molecular ion peak (M+): The molecular ion peak is the highest mass peak in the mass spectrum, which corresponds to the mass of the intact molecule. This peak will give you the molecular weight of the compound.\n\n2. Calculate the elemental composition: Using the molecular weight obtained from the molecular ion peak, you can calculate the possible elemental composition of the compound. For organic compounds, you will typically be looking for the presence of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen.\n\n3. Look for characteristic fragment peaks: Mass spectrometry data can also provide information about the structure of the compound by showing characteristic fragment peaks. These peaks can help you identify functional groups and other structural features of the molecule.\n\n4. Use isotopic patterns: The presence of isotopes in the mass spectrum can also provide valuable information about the molecular formula. For example, the presence of a peak at M+2 with approximately 1/3 the intensity of the M+ peak may indicate the presence of a chlorine atom in the molecule.\n\n5. Compare the data to known compounds: Once you have gathered all the information from the mass spectrum, you can compare it to known compounds to see if there is a match. If there is no match, you can use the data to propose a possible molecular formula for the unknown compound.\n\n6. Confirm the molecular formula: To confirm the molecular formula, you may need to use additional analytical techniques, such as infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, or X-ray crystallography. These techniques can provide further information about the structure of the compound and help you confirm the molecular formula."
