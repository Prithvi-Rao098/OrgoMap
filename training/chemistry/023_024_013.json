    "message_2": "To calculate the theoretical yield of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene, we need to use the stoichiometry of the balanced chemical equation and the molar masses of the reactants and products.\n\nFirst, let's write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nC₆H₅NO₂ (nitrobenzene) + 2 Cl₂ (chlorine gas) → C₆H₃Cl₂NO₂ (2,4-dichloronitrobenzene)\n\nNext, we need to find the molar masses of nitrobenzene and 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene:\n\nNitrobenzene (C₆H₅NO₂): (6 × 12.01) + (5 × 1.01) + (1 × 14.01) + (2 × 16.00) = 123.11 g/mol\n2,4-Dichloronitrobenzene (C₆H₃Cl₂NO₂): (6 × 12.01) + (3 × 1.01) + (2 × 35.45) + (1 × 14.01) + (2 × 16.00) = 202.02 g/mol\n\nNow, we need to convert the given mass of nitrobenzene (10 g) to moles:\n\nmoles of nitrobenzene = mass / molar mass = 10 g / 123.11 g/mol = 0.0812 mol\n\nAccording to the balanced chemical equation, 1 mole of nitrobenzene reacts with 2 moles of chlorine gas to produce 1 mole of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene. Since we have excess chlorine gas, the limiting reactant is nitrobenzene.\n\nNow, we can calculate the theoretical yield of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene:\n\nmoles of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene = moles of nitrobenzene = 0.0812 mol\n\nFinally, we convert the moles of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene to grams:\n\nmass of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene = moles × molar mass = 0.0812 mol × 202.02 g/mol = 16.39 g\n\nThe theoretical yield of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene that can be obtained from reacting 10 grams of nitrobenzene with excess chlorine gas is approximately 16.39 grams."
