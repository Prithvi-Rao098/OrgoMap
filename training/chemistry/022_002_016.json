    "message_1": "A chemist wants to produce 5 grams of ammonia (NH3) gas through the reaction of nitrogen gas (N2) and hydrogen gas (H2). What mass of hydrogen gas is needed, assuming excess nitrogen gas is provided? (Hint: balance the chemical equation and use stoichiometry to calculate the required mass)",
    "message_2": "First, we need to balance the chemical equation for the formation of ammonia:\n\nN2 + 3H2 → 2NH3\n\nNow that we have a balanced equation, we can use stoichiometry to determine the mass of hydrogen gas needed to produce 5 grams of ammonia.\n\n1. Calculate the molar mass of ammonia (NH3):\nN: 14.01 g/mol\nH: 1.01 g/mol\n\nMolar mass of NH3 = 14.01 + (3 × 1.01) = 17.03 g/mol\n\n2. Convert the mass of ammonia to moles:\n5 g NH3 × (1 mol NH3 / 17.03 g NH3) = 0.293 mol NH3\n\n3. Use the stoichiometry of the balanced equation to find the moles of hydrogen gas needed:\n0.293 mol NH3 × (3 mol H2 / 2 mol NH3) = 0.4395 mol H2\n\n4. Convert the moles of hydrogen gas to mass:\n0.4395 mol H2 × (2.02 g H2 / 1 mol H2) = 0.888 g H2\n\nTherefore, 0.888 grams of hydrogen gas is needed to produce 5 grams of ammonia, assuming excess nitrogen gas is provided."
