    "message_2": "The major product formed after the elimination of HBr from but-1-ene in the presence of a strong base is but-1-yne. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nC4H8 + 2 KOH â†’ C4H6 + 2 H2O + 2 KBr\n\nBut-1-ene (C4H8) reacts with two equivalents of a strong base, such as potassium hydroxide (KOH), to form but-1-yne (C4H6), water (H2O), and potassium bromide (KBr)."
