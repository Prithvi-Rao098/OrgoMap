    "message_2": "To determine the monolayer coverage of nitrogen gas on a silica surface using the BET theory, we need to consider the following parameters:\n\n1. Surface area (A) = 100 m²/g\n2. Temperature (T) = 25°C = 298 K\n3. Nitrogen gas pressure (P) = 1 atm\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the adsorption equilibrium constant (K) using the BET equation:\n\nK = exp[(ΔH_ads - RT) / RT]\n\nWhere:\nΔH_ads = heat of adsorption (for nitrogen, it's approximately -8 kJ/mol)\nR = gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\nT = temperature (298 K)\n\nK = exp[(-8000 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K × 298 K)] ≈ 0.034\n\nNext, we need to determine the amount of nitrogen gas adsorbed at monolayer coverage (n_m) using the BET equation:\n\nn_m = (A × N_A × P) / (K × P_0)\n\nWhere:\nA = surface area (100 m²/g)\nN_A = Avogadro's number (6.022 × 10²³ molecules/mol)\nP = nitrogen gas pressure (1 atm)\nK = adsorption equilibrium constant (0.034)\nP_0 = saturation pressure of nitrogen gas at 25°C (approximately 0.035 atm)\n\nn_m = (100 m²/g × 6.022 × 10²³ molecules/mol × 1 atm) / (0.034 × 0.035 atm) ≈ 5.08 × 10²² molecules/g\n\nTherefore, the monolayer coverage of nitrogen gas on a silica surface using the BET theory is approximately 5.08 × 10²² molecules/g."
