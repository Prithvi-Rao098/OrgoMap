    "message_2": "The standard enthalpy change for the fusion reaction of solid sulfur at its melting point to become liquid sulfur at its boiling point can be calculated by considering two separate processes: the melting of solid sulfur (fusion) and the heating of liquid sulfur from its melting point to its boiling point.\n\n1. Enthalpy change of fusion (ΔHfus): The enthalpy change when one mole of a solid substance melts at its melting point under standard conditions (1 atm pressure). For sulfur, the standard enthalpy of fusion is 1.72 kJ/mol.\n\n2. Enthalpy change of heating (ΔHheat): The enthalpy change when one mole of a substance is heated from its melting point to its boiling point. This can be calculated using the formula ΔHheat = m × C × ΔT, where m is the number of moles, C is the specific heat capacity of the substance, and ΔT is the temperature change.\n\nFor sulfur, the specific heat capacity of liquid sulfur is approximately 1.09 J/g·K. The melting point of sulfur is 115.21°C, and its boiling point is 444.6°C. The molar mass of sulfur is 32.06 g/mol.\n\nFirst, convert the temperature change from Celsius to Kelvin: ΔT = (444.6 - 115.21) K = 329.39 K.\n\nNext, calculate the number of grams in one mole of sulfur: 1 mol × 32.06 g/mol = 32.06 g.\n\nNow, calculate the enthalpy change of heating: ΔHheat = (32.06 g) × (1.09 J/g·K) × (329.39 K) = 1150.8 J = 1.15 kJ (rounded to two decimal places).\n\nFinally, add the enthalpy change of fusion and the enthalpy change of heating to find the total standard enthalpy change for the process: ΔHtotal = ΔHfus + ΔHheat = 1.72 kJ + 1.15 kJ = 2.87 kJ/mol."
