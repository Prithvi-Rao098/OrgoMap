    "message_2": "To calculate the surface area of the activated charcoal sample, we will use the BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) equation. The BET equation relates the amount of gas adsorbed on a solid surface to the pressure and the surface area.\n\nThe BET equation is:\n\nn = (n_m * C * P) / [(1 - P) * (1 + (C - 1) * P)]\n\nwhere:\nn = amount of gas adsorbed (mol/g)\nn_m = monolayer capacity (mol/g)\nC = BET constant\nP = relative pressure (P/P0)\n\nWe are given the monolayer capacity (n_m) as 0.16 mol/g and the nitrogen pressure (P) as 0.98 atm. However, we need to find the relative pressure (P/P0) to use in the BET equation. Since the saturation pressure of nitrogen (P0) at 77 K is approximately 1 atm, we can assume P/P0 = 0.98.\n\nNow, we need to find the cross-sectional area of a nitrogen molecule (A_N2). The cross-sectional area of a nitrogen molecule can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nA_N2 = (π * d_N2^2) / 4\n\nwhere d_N2 is the diameter of a nitrogen molecule, which is approximately 0.36 nm. Converting to cm, we get:\n\nd_N2 = 0.36 * 10^(-7) cm\n\nNow, we can calculate A_N2:\n\nA_N2 = (π * (0.36 * 10^(-7) cm)^2) / 4 ≈ 1.02 * 10^(-14) cm²\n\nNow, we can calculate the surface area (S) of the activated charcoal sample using the following formula:\n\nS = (n_m * A_N2 * N_A * W) / ρ\n\nwhere:\nN_A = Avogadro's number (6.022 * 10^23 mol^(-1))\nW = weight of the sample (0.25 g)\nρ = density of the charcoal (2.2 g/cm³)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nS = (0.16 mol/g * 1.02 * 10^(-14) cm² * 6.022 * 10^23 mol^(-1) * 0.25 g) / 2.2 g/cm³ ≈ 882.6 cm²\n\nTherefore, the surface area of the activated charcoal sample is approximately 882.6 cm²."
