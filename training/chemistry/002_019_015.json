    "message_2": "To determine the boiling point of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) at a pressure of 1 atm, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates the vapor pressure of a substance to its temperature and enthalpy of vaporization:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nIn this equation:\n- P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively\n- ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization\n- R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\n\nSince we want to find the boiling point of H2SO4 at a pressure of 1 atm, we can set P2 = 1 atm. The normal boiling point of a substance occurs when its vapor pressure equals the atmospheric pressure (1 atm). We don't have the information about the vapor pressure of H2SO4 at its melting point (10 °C), so we cannot directly use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to find the boiling point.\n\nHowever, we can provide an estimation based on the fact that the boiling point of sulfuric acid is significantly higher than that of water. The boiling point of concentrated sulfuric acid is around 337 °C (639.4 °F) at 1 atm pressure. This value can vary depending on the concentration of the acid, but it gives you an idea of the boiling point range for sulfuric acid at 1 atm pressure."
