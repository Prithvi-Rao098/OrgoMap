    "message_2": "To find the enthalpy change of the ionization reaction of potassium hydroxide (KOH), we first need to determine the number of moles of KOH in the 25.0 g sample. The molar mass of KOH is:\n\nK = 39.10 g/mol\nO = 16.00 g/mol\nH = 1.01 g/mol\nKOH = 39.10 + 16.00 + 1.01 = 56.11 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the number of moles of KOH in the 25.0 g sample:\n\nmoles of KOH = (25.0 g) / (56.11 g/mol) = 0.446 mol\n\nSince the enthalpy of ionization for KOH is -431 kJ/mol, we can now calculate the enthalpy change for the ionization reaction:\n\nenthalpy change = (0.446 mol) * (-431 kJ/mol) = -192.3 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change of the ionization reaction of potassium hydroxide (KOH) when 25.0 g of KOH are completely dissolved in water, giving 1.00 L of solution with a concentration of 0.500 M KOH, is -192.3 kJ."
