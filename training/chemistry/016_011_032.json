    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question for a chemistry student to solve under the subtopic Heat of Mixing Calculations in Thermochemistry:\n\nCalculate the enthalpy change of mixing when 100 mL of 0.1 M NaOH reacts with 100 mL of 0.1 M HCl at constant pressure and temperature of 25°C. The specific heat capacity of the resulting solution is 4.18 J/(g·°C) and the density of the solution is 1.00 g/mL. Assume that the volumes of the reactants are additive and that the process is exothermic.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change of mixing, we first need to determine the heat released during the reaction. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction between NaOH and HCl is:\n\nNaOH(aq) + HCl(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H2O(l)\n\nSince both reactants have the same concentration (0.1 M) and volume (100 mL), the reaction will go to completion, and all of the NaOH and HCl will react.\n\nFirst, let's find the moles of NaOH and HCl:\n\nmoles of NaOH = (0.1 M)(0.100 L) = 0.010 mol\nmoles of HCl = (0.1 M)(0.100 L) = 0.010 mol\n\nNow, let's find the heat released during the reaction. The enthalpy change for the reaction between NaOH and HCl is -57.32 kJ/mol. Since the reaction is exothermic, the heat released (q) will be negative:\n\nq = moles of NaOH × (-57.32 kJ/mol) = (0.010 mol)(-57.32 kJ/mol) = -0.5732 kJ\n\nNow, let's find the mass of the resulting solution. Since the volumes are additive, the total volume is 200 mL, and the density is 1.00 g/mL:\n\nmass of solution = (200 mL)(1.00 g/mL) = 200 g\n\nNext, we need to find the temperature change of the solution. We can use the formula q = mcΔT, where m is the mass of the solution, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the temperature change:\n\n-0.5732 kJ = (200 g)(4.18 J/g·°C)(ΔT)\n\nFirst, convert the heat released to Joules:\n\n-0.5732 kJ × (1000 J/1 kJ) = -573.2 J\n\nNow, solve for ΔT:\n\n-573.2 J = (200 g)(4.18 J/g·°C)(ΔT)\nΔT = -573.2 J / (200 g × 4.18 J/g·°C) = -0.686 °C\n\nSince the process is exothermic, the temperature of the solution will increase. The final temperature of the solution will be:\n\nT_final = T_initial + ΔT = 25°C + (-0.686°C) = 24.314°C\n\nFinally, we can calculate the enthalpy change of mixing (ΔH_mix) using the formula ΔH_mix = q / moles of solute:\n\nΔH_mix = -0.5732 kJ / 0.010 mol = -57.32 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change of mixing when 100 mL of 0.1 M NaOH reacts with 100 mL of 0.1 M HCl is -57.32 kJ/mol."
