What is the equilibrium concentration of oxygen gas in the container?",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium concentration of oxygen gas, we can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to keep track of the changes in concentration for each species involved in the reaction.\n\nInitial concentrations:\n[NO2] = 0.1 M\n[NO] = 0 M (since the reaction has not yet occurred)\n[O2] = 0 M (since the reaction has not yet occurred)\n\nChange in concentrations:\nSince 2 moles of NO2 decompose to form 2 moles of NO and 1 mole of O2, the change in concentration of NO2 is -2x, the change in concentration of NO is +2x, and the change in concentration of O2 is +x.\n\nEquilibrium concentrations:\n[NO2] = 0.1 - 2x\n[NO] = 0 + 2x = 0.05 M (given in the problem)\n[O2] = 0 + x\n\nNow we can solve for x:\n2x = 0.05 M\nx = 0.025 M\n\nSo, the equilibrium concentration of oxygen gas [O2] is:\n[O2] = 0 + x = 0.025 M"
