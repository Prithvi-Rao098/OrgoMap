    "message_2": "The reaction between copper sulfate (CuSO₄) and zinc metal (Zn) is a single displacement reaction. In this reaction, zinc displaces copper from copper sulfate, forming zinc sulfate (ZnSO₄) and copper metal (Cu). The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nCuSO₄(aq) + Zn(s) → ZnSO₄(aq) + Cu(s)\n\nThe predicted products are zinc sulfate (ZnSO₄) and copper metal (Cu)."
