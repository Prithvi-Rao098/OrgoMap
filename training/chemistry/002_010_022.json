    "message_2": "To find the density of magnesium oxide (MgO), we can use the formula:\n\nDensity = Mass / Volume\n\nGiven the mass of MgO is 10 grams and the volume is 6.2 mL, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nDensity = 10 g / 6.2 mL\n\nDensity â‰ˆ 1.61 g/mL\n\nSo, the density of magnesium oxide (MgO) at STP is approximately 1.61 g/mL."
