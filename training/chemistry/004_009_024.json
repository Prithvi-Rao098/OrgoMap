    "message_2": "As a chemist, I would need the specific X-ray diffraction data or pattern of the sample to determine its composition. X-ray diffraction patterns are unique to each crystalline material, and by analyzing the pattern, we can identify the crystal structure and composition of the sample. Please provide the X-ray diffraction data or pattern for the sample in question."
