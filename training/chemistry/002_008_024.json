    "message_2": "To find the percent composition of water (H2O), we need to determine the mass of each element (hydrogen and oxygen) and then find the percentage of each element's mass relative to the total mass of the compound.\n\nFirst, we need to find the molar mass of water:\n1. Hydrogen (H) has an atomic mass of approximately 1 g/mol. Since there are two hydrogen atoms in water, the total mass of hydrogen is 2 g/mol.\n2. Oxygen (O) has an atomic mass of approximately 16 g/mol. There is one oxygen atom in water, so the total mass of oxygen is 16 g/mol.\n\nNow, we can find the molar mass of water (H2O) by adding the mass of hydrogen and oxygen:\nMolar mass of H2O = 2 g/mol (H) + 16 g/mol (O) = 18 g/mol\n\nNext, we will find the percent composition of each element in water:\n\n1. Percent composition of hydrogen (H):\n(2 g/mol (H) / 18 g/mol (H2O)) x 100% = 11.11%\n\n2. Percent composition of oxygen (O):\n(16 g/mol (O) / 18 g/mol (H2O)) x 100% = 88.89%\n\nSo, the percent composition of water (H2O) is approximately 11.11% hydrogen and 88.89% oxygen."
