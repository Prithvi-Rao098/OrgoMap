    "message_1": "What is the expected boiling point of a substance that forms strong hydrogen bonding among its molecules compared to a substance that has weak van der Waals forces?",
    "message_2": "The expected boiling point of a substance that forms strong hydrogen bonding among its molecules would be significantly higher compared to a substance that has weak van der Waals forces. This is because strong hydrogen bonding requires more energy to break the intermolecular forces, resulting in a higher boiling point. In contrast, weak van der Waals forces can be broken more easily, leading to a lower boiling point."
