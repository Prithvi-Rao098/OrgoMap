    "message_2": "To determine the concentration of chloride ions in the salt solution using a Chloride ion-selective electrode (Cl-ISE) with a potential reading of -0.35 V, we need to use the Nernst equation. The Nernst equation relates the potential of an ion-selective electrode to the concentration of the ion being measured.\n\nThe Nernst equation for a Cl-ISE is:\n\nE = E0 + (2.303 * RT/nF) * log([Cl-])\n\nWhere:\nE = measured potential (-0.35 V)\nE0 = standard potential of the Cl-ISE (typically provided by the manufacturer or can be found in literature)\nR = gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\nT = temperature in Kelvin (assume 298 K if not provided)\nn = number of electrons transferred (1 for Cl-)\nF = Faraday's constant (96485 C/mol)\n\nFirst, we need to find the value of E0. If it's not provided, we can assume a typical value for a Cl-ISE, which is around 0.223 V. Now we can plug in the values and solve for [Cl-]:\n\n-0.35 V = 0.223 V + (2.303 * 8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K / (1 * 96485 C/mol)) * log([Cl-])\n\nSolving for [Cl-]:\n\n-0.573 V = (0.05916 V) * log([Cl-])\n-9.68 = log([Cl-])\n[Cl-] = 10^(-9.68)\n\n[Cl-] ≈ 2.07 × 10^(-10) M\n\nSo, the concentration of chloride ions in the given salt solution is approximately 2.07 × 10^(-10) M."
