    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change, we first need to determine the number of moles of NaOH in 5 grams.\n\nThe molar mass of NaOH is:\nNa = 22.99 g/mol\nO = 16.00 g/mol\nH = 1.01 g/mol\nTotal = 22.99 + 16.00 + 1.01 = 40.00 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the number of moles of NaOH in 5 grams:\nmoles = mass / molar mass\nmoles = 5 g / 40.00 g/mol = 0.125 mol\n\nNow, we can use the molar enthalpy of dissolution to find the enthalpy change:\nenthalpy change = moles × molar enthalpy of dissolution\nenthalpy change = 0.125 mol × (-44.5 kJ/mol) = -5.5625 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change of dissolving 5 grams of sodium hydroxide in 100 mL of water at 25°C is -5.5625 kJ."
