    "message_2": "To determine the empirical formula of a compound, follow these steps:\n\n1. Assume you have 100 grams of the compound. This means that the percentages can be treated as grams.\n2. Convert the grams of each element to moles by dividing by the molar mass of each element.\n3. Divide each mole value by the smallest mole value to get the mole ratio.\n4. Round the mole ratios to the nearest whole number to get the empirical formula.\n\nGiven the compound contains:\n- 12.33% sodium (Na) => 12.33 g\n- 20.71% sulfur (S) => 20.71 g\n- 66.96% oxygen (O) => 66.96 g\n\nStep 1: Convert grams to moles:\n- Moles of Na = 12.33 g / 22.99 g/mol (molar mass of Na) = 0.536 mol\n- Moles of S = 20.71 g / 32.07 g/mol (molar mass of S) = 0.646 mol\n- Moles of O = 66.96 g / 16.00 g/mol (molar mass of O) = 4.185 mol\n\nStep 2: Divide each mole value by the smallest mole value (0.536 mol):\n- Na: 0.536 / 0.536 = 1\n- S: 0.646 / 0.536 = 1.205\n- O: 4.185 / 0.536 = 7.807\n\nStep 3: Round the mole ratios to the nearest whole number:\n- Na: 1\n- S: 1\n- O: 8\n\nThe empirical formula of the compound is NaSO8."
