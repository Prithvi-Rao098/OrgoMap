    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the dissolution of 10 grams of NaCl in 100 mL of water, we need to first determine the number of moles of NaCl and then use the enthalpy of solution to find the total enthalpy change.\n\n1. Calculate the number of moles of NaCl:\nThe molar mass of NaCl = 58.44 g/mol (22.99 g/mol for Na + 35.45 g/mol for Cl)\nNumber of moles = mass / molar mass\nNumber of moles = 10 g / 58.44 g/mol = 0.171 moles\n\n2. Calculate the enthalpy change:\nEnthalpy change = number of moles × enthalpy of solution\nEnthalpy change = 0.171 moles × (-3.9 kJ/mol) = -0.667 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change for the dissolution of 10 grams of NaCl in 100 mL of water at 25°C is -0.667 kJ."
