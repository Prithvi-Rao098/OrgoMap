    "message_2": "To calculate the heat capacity of the water, we can use the formula:\n\nHeat capacity (Q) = mass (m) × specific heat (c) × change in temperature (ΔT)\n\nIn this case, the mass (m) of water is 50 grams, the specific heat (c) of water is 4.18 J/g•°C, and the change in temperature (ΔT) is not given. However, since we are asked to find the heat capacity at 25°C, we can assume that the change in temperature is not relevant to the calculation.\n\nSo, the heat capacity (Q) of the water can be calculated as:\n\nQ = m × c\nQ = 50 g × 4.18 J/g•°C\nQ = 209 J/°C\n\nTherefore, the heat capacity of 50 grams of water at a temperature of 25°C is 209 J/°C."
