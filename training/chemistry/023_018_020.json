    "message_2": "To determine the stoichiometric ratio of phenol and nitric acid required to prepare 10 grams of 2,4-dinitrophenol, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nC6H5OH (phenol) + 2 HNO3 (nitric acid) → C6H3N2O5 (2,4-dinitrophenol) + 2 H2O (water)\n\nNow, we need to find the molar masses of phenol, nitric acid, and 2,4-dinitrophenol:\n\nPhenol (C6H5OH): (6 × 12.01) + (6 × 1.01) + (1 × 16.00) + 1.01 = 94.11 g/mol\nNitric acid (HNO3): 1.01 + 14.01 + (3 × 16.00) = 63.01 g/mol\n2,4-Dinitrophenol (C6H3N2O5): (6 × 12.01) + (3 × 1.01) + (2 × 14.01) + (5 × 16.00) = 184.11 g/mol\n\nWe are given that we want to prepare 10 grams of 2,4-dinitrophenol. To find the moles of 2,4-dinitrophenol, we can use the formula:\n\nmoles = mass / molar mass\n\nmoles of 2,4-dinitrophenol = 10 g / 184.11 g/mol = 0.0543 mol\n\nFrom the balanced chemical equation, we can see that 1 mole of phenol reacts with 2 moles of nitric acid to produce 1 mole of 2,4-dinitrophenol. Therefore, the stoichiometric ratio of phenol to nitric acid is 1:2.\n\nNow, we can find the moles of phenol and nitric acid required:\n\nmoles of phenol = 0.0543 mol (since 1:1 ratio with 2,4-dinitrophenol)\nmoles of nitric acid = 0.0543 mol × 2 = 0.1086 mol (since 1:2 ratio with phenol)\n\nFinally, we can find the mass of phenol and nitric acid required:\n\nmass of phenol = moles × molar mass = 0.0543 mol × 94.11 g/mol = 5.11 g\nmass of nitric acid = moles × molar mass = 0.1086 mol × 63.01 g/mol = 6.84 g\n\nSo, to prepare 10 grams of 2,4-dinitrophenol, we need 5.11 grams of phenol and 6.84 grams of nitric acid. The correct stoichiometric ratio of phenol to nitric acid is 1:2."
