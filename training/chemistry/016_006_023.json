    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of methane, we can use Hess's Law, which states that the total enthalpy change for a reaction is the sum of the enthalpy changes for each step in the reaction. In this case, we can use the standard enthalpies of formation for the reactants and products.\n\nThe enthalpy change for the reaction can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nΔH = Σ(ΔHf(products)) - Σ(ΔHf(reactants))\n\nFor the products, we have 1 mol of CO2 and 2 mol of H2O(g). For the reactants, we have 1 mol of CH4 and 2 mol of O2. Note that the standard enthalpy of formation for O2 is 0 kJ/mol since it is in its elemental form.\n\nΔH = [(1 mol × -393.5 kJ/mol) + (2 mol × -241.8 kJ/mol)] - [(1 mol × -74.6 kJ/mol) + (2 mol × 0 kJ/mol)]\n\nHere, we used the standard enthalpy of formation for H2O(g) which is -241.8 kJ/mol instead of H2O(l) which is -285.8 kJ/mol, as the reaction produces gaseous water.\n\nΔH = (-393.5 kJ + (-483.6 kJ)) - (-74.6 kJ)\nΔH = (-877.1 kJ) - (-74.6 kJ)\nΔH = -802.5 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change for the combustion of methane to form carbon dioxide and water is -802.5 kJ/mol."
