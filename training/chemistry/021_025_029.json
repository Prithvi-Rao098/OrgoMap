    "message_1": "Identify the type of bonding in a solid having the following properties:\n- It has a high melting and boiling point\n- It is very hard and brittle\n- It does not conduct electricity in its solid state, but conducts when molten or dissolved in water\n- It has a crystal lattice structure with closely packed atoms.",
    "message_2": "The type of bonding in a solid with these properties is ionic bonding. Ionic compounds form when a metal transfers one or more electrons to a non-metal, resulting in the formation of positively charged cations and negatively charged anions. These ions are held together by strong electrostatic forces in a crystal lattice structure, which gives ionic compounds their high melting and boiling points, hardness, and brittleness. They do not conduct electricity in their solid state because the ions are fixed in place, but when molten or dissolved in water, the ions are free to move and can conduct electricity."
