    "message_2": "To determine the bond order of the nitrogen molecule (N2) using molecular orbital theory, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the total number of valence electrons in the molecule.\n2. Fill the molecular orbitals according to the Aufbau principle, Hund's rule, and Pauli exclusion principle.\n3. Calculate the bond order using the formula: Bond order = (number of electrons in bonding orbitals - number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\n\nStep 1: Determine the total number of valence electrons\nNitrogen has 5 valence electrons, and since there are two nitrogen atoms in N2, the total number of valence electrons is 5 * 2 = 10.\n\nStep 2: Fill the molecular orbitals\nThe order of filling molecular orbitals in diatomic molecules is as follows: σ1s < σ*1s < σ2s < σ*2s < π2p < σ2p < π*2p < σ*2p\nWe have 10 electrons to fill in the molecular orbitals, so we fill them in this order:\n- 2 electrons in σ1s\n- 2 electrons in σ*1s\n- 2 electrons in σ2s\n- 2 electrons in σ*2s\n- 2 electrons in π2p (one in each degenerate orbital)\n\nStep 3: Calculate the bond order\nBond order = (number of electrons in bonding orbitals - number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\nIn N2, we have:\n- Bonding orbitals: σ1s (2 electrons), σ2s (2 electrons), and π2p (2 electrons) = 6 electrons\n- Antibonding orbitals: σ*1s (2 electrons) and σ*2s (2 electrons) = 4 electrons\n\nBond order = (6 - 4) / 2 = 2\n\nSo, the bond order of the nitrogen molecule (N2) using molecular orbital theory is 2."
