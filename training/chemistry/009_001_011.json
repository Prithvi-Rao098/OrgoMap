    "message_2": "To determine the activity of the sample after 8 days, we can use the radioactive decay formula:\n\nActivity_final = Activity_initial * (1/2)^(time_elapsed / half_life)\n\nwhere\nActivity_initial = 2000 Bq (initial activity)\ntime_elapsed = 8 days\nhalf_life = 8 days (half-life of iodine-131)\n\nActivity_final = 2000 * (1/2)^(8/8)\nActivity_final = 2000 * (1/2)^1\nActivity_final = 2000 * 0.5\nActivity_final = 1000 Bq\n\nThe activity of the sample after 8 days is 1000 Bq."
