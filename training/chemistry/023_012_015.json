    "message_1": "What is the yield of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene that can be obtained if 500 mL of toluene is mixed with 700 mL of nitric acid (concentration 65%) and the reaction is carried out for 2 hours at a temperature of 60°C?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the yield of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) from the given reaction, we need to determine the limiting reactant and use stoichiometry to find the theoretical yield. Then, we can compare the theoretical yield to the actual yield to determine the percentage yield.\n\nFirst, let's find the moles of each reactant:\n\n1. Toluene (C7H8) has a density of 0.87 g/mL and a molar mass of 92.14 g/mol.\n500 mL of toluene = 500 mL * 0.87 g/mL = 435 g\nMoles of toluene = 435 g / 92.14 g/mol = 4.72 mol\n\n2. Nitric acid (HNO3) has a density of 1.51 g/mL for a 65% solution and a molar mass of 63.01 g/mol.\n700 mL of 65% nitric acid = 700 mL * 1.51 g/mL * 0.65 = 682.95 g\nMoles of nitric acid = 682.95 g / 63.01 g/mol = 10.84 mol\n\nNow, let's determine the limiting reactant using the stoichiometry of the reaction:\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the nitration of toluene to TNT is:\n\nC7H8 + 3 HNO3 → C7H5N3O6 + 3 H2O\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of toluene reacts with 3 moles of nitric acid to produce 1 mole of TNT.\n\nMoles of nitric acid required for complete reaction with toluene = 4.72 mol * 3 = 14.16 mol\n\nSince we only have 10.84 mol of nitric acid, nitric acid is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow, let's calculate the theoretical yield of TNT:\n\nMoles of TNT = (10.84 mol nitric acid) / 3 = 3.61 mol\n\nThe molar mass of TNT (C7H5N3O6) is 227.13 g/mol.\n\nMass of TNT = 3.61 mol * 227.13 g/mol = 819.93 g\n\nThe theoretical yield of TNT is 819.93 g.\n\nHowever, the actual yield of the reaction depends on various factors such as reaction efficiency, side reactions, and product loss during purification. To determine the actual yield, you would need to perform the reaction and measure the mass of the obtained TNT. Then, you can calculate the percentage yield by dividing the actual yield by the theoretical yield and multiplying by 100."
