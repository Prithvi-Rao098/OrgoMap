    "message_1": "What is the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the following chemical reaction at 298 K? \n\n2NO2(g) ⇌ N2O4(g) \n\nAt equilibrium, the concentration of NO2 is 0.50 M and the concentration of N2O4 is 0.20 M. Remember to write the expression for the equilibrium constant and make sure it is correctly dimensionless.",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction, we first need to write the expression for the equilibrium constant. The general form of the equilibrium constant expression is:\n\nKc = [products]^(coefficients) / [reactants]^(coefficients)\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\n2NO2(g) ⇌ N2O4(g)\n\nThe equilibrium constant expression will be:\n\nKc = [N2O4] / [NO2]^2\n\nNow, we are given the equilibrium concentrations of NO2 and N2O4:\n\n[NO2] = 0.50 M\n[N2O4] = 0.20 M\n\nPlug these values into the Kc expression:\n\nKc = (0.20) / (0.50)^2\n\nKc = 0.20 / 0.25\n\nKc = 0.80\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction at 298 K is 0.80."
