    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of methane, we can use Hess's Law, which states that the total enthalpy change for a reaction is the sum of the enthalpy changes for the products minus the sum of the enthalpy changes for the reactants.\n\nΔH_combustion = Σ ΔHf_products - Σ ΔHf_reactants\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\nCH4 (g) + 2O2 (g) -> CO2 (g) + 2H2O (l)\n\nThe enthalpy change for the products is:\n\nΔHf_products = (1 mol CO2 × -393.5 kJ/mol) + (2 mol H2O × -285.8 kJ/mol) = -393.5 kJ - 571.6 kJ = -965.1 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change for the reactants is:\n\nΔHf_reactants = (1 mol CH4 × -74.9 kJ/mol) + (2 mol O2 × 0 kJ/mol) = -74.9 kJ\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of methane:\n\nΔH_combustion = ΔHf_products - ΔHf_reactants = -965.1 kJ - (-74.9 kJ) = -890.2 kJ\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy change for the combustion of methane at constant pressure is -890.2 kJ/mol."
