    "message_2": "To determine the solubility of sodium chloride (NaCl) in water at 25°C, we can use the Van't Hoff equation, which relates the temperature, solubility, and thermodynamic properties of a solute:\n\nΔG = -RT ln(K)\n\nWhere:\nΔG is the Gibbs free energy change\nR is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol K)\nT is the temperature in Kelvin (25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K)\nK is the equilibrium constant (which is related to solubility)\n\nWe also know that ΔG = ΔH - TΔS, where ΔH is the enthalpy change (molar heat of solution) and ΔS is the entropy change. We are given the values for ΔH (-3.9 kJ/mol) and ΔS (3.3 J/mol K). First, we need to convert ΔH to J/mol:\n\nΔH = -3.9 kJ/mol × 1000 J/kJ = -3900 J/mol\n\nNow we can calculate ΔG:\n\nΔG = ΔH - TΔS\nΔG = -3900 J/mol - (298.15 K × 3.3 J/mol K)\nΔG = -3900 J/mol - 983.895 J/mol\nΔG = -4883.895 J/mol\n\nNow we can use the Van't Hoff equation to find the equilibrium constant K:\n\n-4883.895 J/mol = - (8.314 J/mol K) × 298.15 K × ln(K)\nln(K) = 4883.895 J/mol / (8.314 J/mol K × 298.15 K)\nln(K) = 1.976\n\nNow, we can find K:\n\nK = e^1.976 = 7.215\n\nThe solubility product constant (Ksp) for NaCl can be represented as:\n\nKsp = [Na+][Cl-]\n\nSince the stoichiometry of NaCl is 1:1, the concentration of Na+ and Cl- ions will be equal (let's call it x). Therefore:\n\nKsp = x^2\n\nNow we can solve for x (the solubility of NaCl):\n\n7.215 = x^2\nx = sqrt(7.215)\nx ≈ 2.69 mol/L\n\nSo, the solubility of sodium chloride in water at 25°C is approximately 2.69 mol/L."
