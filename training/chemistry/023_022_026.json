    "message_2": "The preparation of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid from benzoic acid and nitric acid involves a nitration reaction. The specific mechanism and reaction conditions are as follows:\n\n1. Reaction conditions:\n- Concentrated nitric acid (HNO3)\n- Concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) as a catalyst\n- Temperature: 0-5°C (ice bath) for the first nitration step, and around 50-60°C for the second nitration step\n\n2. Mechanism:\na) Formation of the nitronium ion (NO2+):\nConcentrated H2SO4 protonates HNO3, forming the nitronium ion (NO2+) and bisulfate ion (HSO4-).\nHNO3 + H2SO4 -> NO2+ + HSO4- + H2O\n\nb) First nitration step (formation of 4-nitrobenzoic acid):\nThe nitronium ion (NO2+) acts as an electrophile and attacks the aromatic ring of benzoic acid, forming an intermediate arenium ion. The most favorable position for the first nitration is the para position (4-position) due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the carboxyl group (-COOH) in benzoic acid. The intermediate then loses a proton to regenerate the aromatic ring, resulting in the formation of 4-nitrobenzoic acid.\n\nc) Second nitration step (formation of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid):\nThe 4-nitrobenzoic acid undergoes a second nitration reaction, with the nitronium ion attacking the ortho position (2-position) relative to the carboxyl group. This forms an intermediate arenium ion, which then loses a proton to regenerate the aromatic ring, resulting in the formation of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid.\n\n3. Intermediate products:\n- 4-nitrobenzoic acid\n- Arenium ion intermediates during the nitration steps\n\nOverall, the reaction can be summarized as:\nC6H5COOH (benzoic acid) + 2 HNO3 (nitric acid) -> C6H3(NO2)2COOH (2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid) + 2 H2O (water)"
