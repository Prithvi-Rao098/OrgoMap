    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the transition of ice to water, we need to consider three steps:\n\n1. Heating the ice from -10 °C to 0 °C\n2. Melting the ice at 0 °C\n3. Heating the water from 0 °C to 50 °C\n\nFirst, let's calculate the moles of water in 50 grams:\nmoles = mass / molar mass = 50 g / 18 g/mol = 2.78 mol\n\nStep 1: Heating the ice from -10 °C to 0 °C\nq1 = mass × specific heat capacity of ice × ΔT\nq1 = 50 g × 2.09 J/g°C × (0 - (-10)) °C\nq1 = 50 g × 2.09 J/g°C × 10 °C\nq1 = 1045 J\n\nStep 2: Melting the ice at 0 °C\nThe enthalpy of fusion for water is 6.01 kJ/mol. We will use this to calculate the energy required to melt the ice.\nq2 = moles × enthalpy of fusion\nq2 = 2.78 mol × 6.01 kJ/mol\nq2 = 16.7 kJ\nConvert to Joules:\nq2 = 16.7 kJ × 1000 J/kJ = 16700 J\n\nStep 3: Heating the water from 0 °C to 50 °C\nq3 = mass × specific heat capacity of water × ΔT\nq3 = 50 g × 4.18 J/g°C × (50 - 0) °C\nq3 = 50 g × 4.18 J/g°C × 50 °C\nq3 = 10450 J\n\nNow, we add up the energy for all three steps to find the total standard enthalpy change:\nTotal enthalpy change = q1 + q2 + q3\nTotal enthalpy change = 1045 J + 16700 J + 10450 J\nTotal enthalpy change = 28195 J\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the transition of 50 grams of ice to water when heated from -10 °C to 50 °C is 28,195 Joules."
