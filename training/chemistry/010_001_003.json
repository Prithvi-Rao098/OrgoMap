    "message_2": "To find the standard electrode potential of the given reaction, we need to look up the standard electrode potentials for each half-reaction involved. In this case, we have the reduction of silver ions (Ag+) to solid silver (Ag) and the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) as the reference electrode.\n\nThe standard electrode potential for the reduction of silver ions to solid silver is:\n\nAg+ (aq) + e- → Ag (s)  E° = +0.80 V\n\nThe standard hydrogen electrode has a potential of 0 V by definition:\n\n2H+ (aq) + 2e- → H2 (g)  E° = 0.00 V\n\nNow, we can use the formula Ecell = Ecathode - Eanode to find the standard electrode potential of the given reaction:\n\nEcell = E(Ag+/Ag) - E(SHE)\n\nEcell = (+0.80 V) - (0.00 V)\n\nEcell = +0.80 V\n\nSo, the standard electrode potential of the given reaction using a standard hydrogen electrode as the reference electrode is +0.80 V."
