    "message_1": "What is the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the following reaction at a temperature of 298 K, given the concentrations of the reactants and products:\n\nNOCl(g) ⇌ NO(g) + ½Cl₂(g)\n\n[NOCl] = 0.01 M\n[NO] = 0.02 M\n[Cl₂] = 0.005 M",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction, we need to use the expression for Kc, which is the ratio of the concentrations of the products raised to their stoichiometric coefficients divided by the concentrations of the reactants raised to their stoichiometric coefficients.\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\nNOCl(g) ⇌ NO(g) + ½Cl₂(g)\n\nThe expression for Kc is:\n\nKc = ([NO] * [Cl₂]^½) / [NOCl]\n\nNow, we can plug in the given concentrations:\n\nKc = (0.02 * (0.005)^½) / 0.01\n\nKc = (0.02 * 0.070710678) / 0.01\n\nKc = 1.41421356\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction at 298 K is approximately 1.41."
