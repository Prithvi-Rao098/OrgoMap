    "message_1": "A chemistry student is trying to determine the boiling point of a solution containing 30 grams of glucose (C6H12O6) dissolved in 100 grams of water. Given that the boiling point of pure water is 100°C and the elevation constant for water is 0.512°C/m, what is the boiling point of the solution?",
    "message_2": "To determine the boiling point of the solution, we can use the formula for boiling point elevation:\n\nΔTb = Kb * molality * i\n\nwhere ΔTb is the change in boiling point, Kb is the boiling point elevation constant for water (0.512°C/m), molality is the molality of the solution, and i is the van't Hoff factor (number of particles the solute dissociates into, which is 1 for glucose as it does not dissociate in water).\n\nFirst, we need to find the molality of the solution. Molality is defined as the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. \n\n1. Calculate the moles of glucose:\nMolar mass of glucose (C6H12O6) = (6 * 12.01) + (12 * 1.01) + (6 * 16.00) = 72.06 + 12.12 + 96.00 = 180.18 g/mol\n\nMoles of glucose = (30 g) / (180.18 g/mol) = 0.1666 mol\n\n2. Convert the mass of water to kilograms:\n100 g = 0.1 kg\n\n3. Calculate the molality of the solution:\nMolality = (0.1666 mol) / (0.1 kg) = 1.666 mol/kg\n\n4. Calculate the boiling point elevation:\nΔTb = Kb * molality * i\nΔTb = (0.512°C/m) * (1.666 mol/kg) * 1 = 0.853°C\n\n5. Determine the boiling point of the solution:\nBoiling point of solution = boiling point of pure water + ΔTb\nBoiling point of solution = 100°C + 0.853°C = 100.853°C\n\nThe boiling point of the solution is approximately 100.853°C."
