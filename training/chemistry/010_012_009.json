    "message_1": "Here is a precise question for the student to solve:\n\nA student performed an electroplating experiment of copper metal onto an electrode by passing a constant current of 1.5 A through a solution of copper(II) sulfate for 50 minutes. If the mass of the copper metal obtained was 1.23 grams, calculate the Faraday constant using the following formula: \n\nFaraday constant = (mass of substance plated x molar mass of substance) / (current x time)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the Faraday constant, we will use the given formula:\n\nFaraday constant = (mass of substance plated x molar mass of substance) / (current x time)\n\nFirst, we need to gather the necessary information:\n\nMass of copper plated = 1.23 grams\nMolar mass of copper = 63.55 grams/mol (rounded to two decimal places)\nCurrent = 1.5 A\nTime = 50 minutes\n\nNow, we need to convert the time from minutes to seconds, as the unit for current is in Amperes (Coulombs/second):\n\n50 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 3000 seconds\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nFaraday constant = (1.23 grams x 63.55 grams/mol) / (1.5 A x 3000 seconds)\n\nFaraday constant = (78.1605 gram·mol) / (4500 A·s)\n\nFaraday constant ≈ 17.369 mol·A·s\n\nThe calculated Faraday constant is approximately 17.369 mol·A·s. However, the actual Faraday constant is known to be around 96,485 C/mol (Coulombs per mole). The discrepancy in the calculated value could be due to experimental errors or inaccuracies in the given data."
