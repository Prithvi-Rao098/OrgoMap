    "message_1": "What is the vibrational frequency of a molecule of carbon dioxide (CO2) in its ground state? Provide your answer in units of wavenumber (cm-1).",
    "message_2": "In a carbon dioxide (CO2) molecule, there are three fundamental vibrational modes: symmetric stretching, asymmetric stretching, and bending. The vibrational frequencies for these modes are as follows:\n\n1. Symmetric stretching (ν1): 1286 cm⁻¹\n2. Asymmetric stretching (ν3): 2349 cm⁻¹\n3. Bending (ν2): 667 cm⁻¹\n\nIn the ground state, the vibrational frequency of a CO2 molecule is the lowest frequency mode, which is the bending mode (ν2). Therefore, the vibrational frequency of a CO2 molecule in its ground state is 667 cm⁻¹."
