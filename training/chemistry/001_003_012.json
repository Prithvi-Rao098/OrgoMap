    "message_2": "2,3-dibromobutane has two chiral centers, which are carbons 2 and 3. To determine the number of stereoisomers, we can use the formula 2^n, where n is the number of chiral centers. In this case, n = 2, so there are 2^2 = 4 stereoisomers.\n\nHere are the structures of the 4 stereoisomers:\n\n1. (2R,3R)-2,3-dibromobutane:\n   H H Br H\n    | | | |\nH3C-C-C-C-CH3\n    | | | |\n   Br H H Br\n\n2. (2S,3S)-2,3-dibromobutane:\n   Br H H Br\n    | | | |\nH3C-C-C-C-CH3\n    | | | |\n   H H Br H\n\n3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dibromobutane:\n   H H Br Br\n    | | | |\nH3C-C-C-C-CH3\n    | | | |\n   Br H H H\n\n4. (2S,3R)-2,3-dibromobutane:\n   Br H H H\n    | | | |\nH3C-C-C-C-CH3\n    | | | |\n   H H Br Br\n\nThese are the four possible stereoisomers of 2,3-dibromobutane: (2R,3R)-2,3-dibromobutane, (2S,3S)-2,3-dibromobutane, (2R,3S)-2,3-dibromobutane, and (2S,3R)-2,3-dibromobutane."
