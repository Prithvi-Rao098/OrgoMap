    "message_2": "To determine the percentage composition of a mixture of hydrocarbons obtained from a petroleum sample using gas chromatography analysis, you would need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Obtain the gas chromatography (GC) data: You will need the GC data, which typically includes a chromatogram showing the peaks corresponding to the different hydrocarbons present in the sample and their respective retention times.\n\n2. Identify the hydrocarbons: Using the retention times and comparing them to known standards or a reference library, identify the hydrocarbons present in the sample.\n\n3. Calculate the area under each peak: The area under each peak in the chromatogram is proportional to the concentration of the corresponding hydrocarbon in the sample. You can use specialized software or manual integration techniques to calculate the area under each peak.\n\n4. Calculate the total area: Add up the areas of all the peaks to obtain the total area.\n\n5. Calculate the percentage composition: Divide the area of each individual peak by the total area and multiply by 100 to obtain the percentage composition of each hydrocarbon in the mixture.\n\nFor example, if you have the following areas for three hydrocarbons:\n\n- Hydrocarbon A: 3000 units\n- Hydrocarbon B: 5000 units\n- Hydrocarbon C: 2000 units\n\nThe total area would be 3000 + 5000 + 2000 = 10000 units.\n\nThe percentage composition of each hydrocarbon would be:\n\n- Hydrocarbon A: (3000/10000) x 100 = 30%\n- Hydrocarbon B: (5000/10000) x 100 = 50%\n- Hydrocarbon C: (2000/10000) x 100 = 20%\n\nSo, the percentage composition of the mixture would be 30% Hydrocarbon A, 50% Hydrocarbon B, and 20% Hydrocarbon C."
