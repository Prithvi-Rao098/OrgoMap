    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) for the reaction, we first need to determine the overall cell potential (E°) for the reaction. This can be done by adding the standard electrode potentials for the two half-reactions:\n\nE°(Fe3+(aq) + e- → Fe2+(aq)) = -0.77 V\nE°(Cl2(g) + 2e- → 2Cl-(aq)) = 1.36 V\n\nSince the Fe3+/Fe2+ half-reaction needs to be reversed to match the overall reaction, we need to change the sign of its potential:\n\nE°(Fe2+(aq) → Fe3+(aq) + e-) = 0.77 V\n\nNow, we can add the potentials for the two half-reactions:\n\nE°(overall) = E°(Fe2+(aq) → Fe3+(aq) + e-) + E°(Cl2(g) + 2e- → 2Cl-(aq))\nE°(overall) = 0.77 V + 1.36 V\nE°(overall) = 2.13 V\n\nNext, we can use the Nernst equation to calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°):\n\nΔG° = -nFE°\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the reaction (in this case, 2) and F is the Faraday constant (approximately 96,485 C/mol).\n\nΔG° = -2 * 96,485 C/mol * 2.13 V\nΔG° = -411,032 J/mol\n\nSo, the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) for the reaction at 298 K is -411,032 J/mol."
