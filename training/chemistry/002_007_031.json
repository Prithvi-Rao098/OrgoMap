    "message_1": "What are the products of the reaction between hydrochloric acid and magnesium oxide? Write a balanced chemical equation for the reaction and identify the type of reaction based on the chemical equation.",
    "message_2": "When hydrochloric acid (HCl) reacts with magnesium oxide (MgO), the products formed are magnesium chloride (MgCl₂) and water (H₂O). The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nMgO + 2HCl → MgCl₂ + H₂O\n\nThis reaction is an example of an acid-base reaction, specifically a neutralization reaction, where an acid reacts with a base to produce a salt and water."
