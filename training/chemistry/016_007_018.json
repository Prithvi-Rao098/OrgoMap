    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy of formation of glucose (C6H12O6), we can use the following equation:\n\nΔHf = Σ ΔHf(products) - Σ ΔHf(reactants)\n\nThe balanced equation for the formation of glucose is:\n\n6C + 6H2 + 3O2 → C6H12O6\n\nThe standard enthalpies of combustion for glucose, carbon, and hydrogen are given as -2803.6 kJ/mol, -393.5 kJ/mol, and -285.8 kJ/mol, respectively. We can use these values to find the standard enthalpies of formation for the reactants and products.\n\nFor carbon (C), the standard enthalpy of formation is 0 kJ/mol since it is in its elemental form.\n\nFor hydrogen (H2), the standard enthalpy of formation is also 0 kJ/mol since it is in its elemental form.\n\nFor oxygen (O2), the standard enthalpy of formation is 0 kJ/mol since it is in its elemental form.\n\nNow, we can use the standard enthalpies of combustion to find the standard enthalpy of formation for glucose (C6H12O6). The balanced equation for the combustion of glucose is:\n\nC6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O\n\nUsing the given standard enthalpies of combustion:\n\n-2803.6 kJ/mol = 6(-393.5 kJ/mol) + 6(-285.8 kJ/mol) - ΔHf(C6H12O6) - 6(0 kJ/mol)\n\n-2803.6 kJ/mol = -2361 kJ/mol - 1714.8 kJ/mol - ΔHf(C6H12O6)\n\nΔHf(C6H12O6) = -2361 kJ/mol - 1714.8 kJ/mol + 2803.6 kJ/mol\n\nΔHf(C6H12O6) = -272.2 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy of formation of glucose (C6H12O6) is -272.2 kJ/mol."
