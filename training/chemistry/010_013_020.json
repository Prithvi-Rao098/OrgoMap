    "message_2": "To calculate the number of electrons transferred during the redox reaction, we need to determine the change in oxidation states for each element involved in the reaction.\n\nIn the given reaction:\n\nCu(s) + 2Ag+ --> Cu2+ + 2Ag(s)\n\nThe oxidation states of the elements are as follows:\n\nCu: 0 (in its elemental form)\nAg+: +1 (as a cation)\n\nCu2+: +2 (as a cation)\nAg: 0 (in its elemental form)\n\nNow, let's determine the change in oxidation states:\n\nFor Cu: It goes from an oxidation state of 0 to +2, which means it loses 2 electrons. This is the oxidation half-reaction: Cu --> Cu2+ + 2e-\n\nFor Ag+: It goes from an oxidation state of +1 to 0, which means it gains 1 electron. Since there are 2 moles of Ag+ in the reaction, a total of 2 electrons are gained. This is the reduction half-reaction: 2Ag+ + 2e- --> 2Ag\n\nIn this redox reaction, a total of 2 electrons are transferred from Cu to 2Ag+."
