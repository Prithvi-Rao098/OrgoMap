    "message_2": "The specific effect of increasing temperature on the reaction rate of the reaction between sodium thiosulphate (Na2S2O3) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) is that the reaction rate increases. This can be explained in terms of the collision theory.\n\nThe collision theory states that for a reaction to occur, the reactant particles must collide with each other with sufficient energy and proper orientation. The energy required for a successful collision is called the activation energy (Ea). When the temperature increases, the kinetic energy of the particles also increases. This leads to an increase in the frequency and energy of collisions between the reactant particles.\n\nIn the case of the reaction between sodium thiosulphate and hydrochloric acid, increasing the temperature causes the Na2S2O3 and HCl particles to move faster and collide more frequently. As a result, there is a higher probability of successful collisions with enough energy to overcome the activation energy barrier. This leads to an increase in the reaction rate.\n\nMoreover, the increase in temperature also affects the distribution of energy among the particles. According to the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, at higher temperatures, a greater proportion of particles have energy equal to or greater than the activation energy. This further contributes to the increase in the reaction rate.\n\nIn summary, increasing the temperature in the reaction between sodium thiosulphate and hydrochloric acid leads to an increase in the reaction rate due to more frequent and energetic collisions between the reactant particles, as explained by the collision theory."
