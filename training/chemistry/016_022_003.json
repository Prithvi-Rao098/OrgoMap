Assume that the enthalpy change of vaporization for both compounds is negligible.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change of isomerization for the reaction of cyclopropane to propene, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH_reaction = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nIn this case, the reactant is cyclopropane and the product is propene. The standard enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) for cyclopropane is -119.1 kJ/mol, and for propene, it is -103.8 kJ/mol.\n\nΔH_reaction = [(-103.8 kJ/mol) * 1] - [(-119.1 kJ/mol) * 1]\n\nΔH_reaction = -103.8 kJ/mol + 119.1 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_reaction = 15.3 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change of isomerization for the reaction of cyclopropane to propene is 15.3 kJ/mol."
