    "message_1": "A chemistry student needs to calculate the standard enthalpy change for the combustion reaction of methane gas (CH4) at 298 K and 1 atm pressure. The equation for the reaction is:\n\nCH4(g) + 2O2(g) --> CO2(g) + 2H2O(l)\n\nGiven the following standard enthalpies of formation at 298 K:\n\nΔHf(CO2) = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔHf(H2O) = -285.8 kJ/mol\nΔHf(CH4) = -74.8 kJ/mol\n\nCalculate ΔHrxn, the standard enthalpy change for the combustion reaction of methane gas.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change (ΔHrxn) for the combustion reaction of methane gas, we can use Hess's Law, which states that the total enthalpy change for a reaction is the sum of the enthalpy changes for the products minus the sum of the enthalpy changes for the reactants.\n\nΔHrxn = [ΔHf(CO2) + 2 * ΔHf(H2O)] - [ΔHf(CH4) + 2 * ΔHf(O2)]\n\nSince the standard enthalpy of formation for an element in its standard state is zero, the ΔHf(O2) term is 0.\n\nΔHrxn = [(-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 * (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [(-74.8 kJ/mol) + 2 * (0 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔHrxn = (-393.5 - 571.6 + 74.8) kJ/mol\n\nΔHrxn = -890.3 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the combustion reaction of methane gas (CH4) at 298 K and 1 atm pressure is -890.3 kJ/mol."
