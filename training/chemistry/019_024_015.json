    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the neutralization reaction, we need to use Hess's Law, which states that the total enthalpy change for a reaction is the sum of the enthalpy changes for each step in the reaction.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard enthalpy of formation for the products, NaCl and H2O. The standard enthalpy of formation for NaCl is -411.12 kJ/mol, and for H2O (l) is -285.83 kJ/mol.\n\nNow, we can use Hess's Law to calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nΔH_reaction = ΔH_products - ΔH_reactants\n\nΔH_reaction = [(-411.12 kJ/mol) + (-285.83 kJ/mol)] - [(-92.31 kJ/mol) + (-469.11 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH_reaction = (-696.95 kJ/mol) - (-561.42 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH_reaction = -135.53 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the neutralization reaction between hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide is -135.53 kJ/mol."
