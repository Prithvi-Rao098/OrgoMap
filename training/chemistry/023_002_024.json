    "message_2": "To determine the mass of benzocaine that can be synthesized from 3.50 grams of p-aminobenzoic acid and excess ethanol, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\np-aminobenzoic acid + ethanol → benzocaine + water\n\nC7H7NO2 + C2H5OH → C9H11NO2 + H2O\n\nNext, we need to find the molar mass of p-aminobenzoic acid and benzocaine:\n\nMolar mass of p-aminobenzoic acid (C7H7NO2) = (7 × 12.01) + (7 × 1.01) + (1 × 14.01) + (2 × 16.00) = 137.14 g/mol\n\nMolar mass of benzocaine (C9H11NO2) = (9 × 12.01) + (11 × 1.01) + (1 × 14.01) + (2 × 16.00) = 165.19 g/mol\n\nNow, we can use stoichiometry to find the mass of benzocaine produced:\n\n1. Convert the mass of p-aminobenzoic acid to moles:\nmoles of p-aminobenzoic acid = 3.50 g / 137.14 g/mol = 0.0255 mol\n\n2. Determine the moles of benzocaine produced:\nSince the reaction has a 1:1 stoichiometry, the moles of benzocaine produced will be equal to the moles of p-aminobenzoic acid used:\nmoles of benzocaine = 0.0255 mol\n\n3. Convert the moles of benzocaine to mass:\nmass of benzocaine = moles of benzocaine × molar mass of benzocaine\nmass of benzocaine = 0.0255 mol × 165.19 g/mol = 4.21 g\n\nTherefore, 4.21 grams of benzocaine can be synthesized from 3.50 grams of p-aminobenzoic acid and excess ethanol, assuming a 100% yield."
