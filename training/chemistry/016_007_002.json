    "message_2": "To determine the standard enthalpy of formation of methane (CH4), we need to use the information provided and apply Hess's Law. Hess's Law states that the enthalpy change of a reaction is the same, whether it occurs in one step or several steps. \n\nConsider the following reactions:\n\n1. C (graphite) + 2 H2 (g) → CH4 (g)  ΔHf° = x kJ/mol (This is the reaction we want to find the enthalpy for)\n\n2. C (graphite) + O2 (g) → CO2 (g)  ΔHf° = -393.5 kJ/mol\n\n3. 2 H2 (g) + O2 (g) → 2 H2O (l)  ΔHf° = 2 * (-285.8 kJ/mol) = -571.6 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can manipulate reactions 2 and 3 to obtain reaction 1:\n\nReverse reaction 2:\nCO2 (g) → C (graphite) + O2 (g)  ΔHf° = 393.5 kJ/mol\n\nDivide reaction 3 by 2:\nH2 (g) + 1/2 O2 (g) → H2O (l)  ΔHf° = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nNow, add the reversed reaction 2 and the divided reaction 3:\nCO2 (g) + H2 (g) + 1/2 O2 (g) → C (graphite) + O2 (g) + H2O (l)  ΔHf° = 393.5 kJ/mol - 285.8 kJ/mol = 107.7 kJ/mol\n\nFinally, subtract the enthalpy of the reaction CO2 (g) + 2 H2O (l) → CH4 (g) + 2 O2 (g) from the reaction above:\nC (graphite) + 2 H2 (g) → CH4 (g)  ΔHf° = x kJ/mol\n\nx = 107.7 kJ/mol - (-393.5 kJ/mol) = 501.2 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy of formation of methane (CH4) is 501.2 kJ/mol."
