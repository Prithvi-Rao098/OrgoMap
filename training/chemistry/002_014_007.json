    "message_2": "To calculate the formal charge of sulfur in the sulfate ion (SO₄²⁻), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the number of valence electrons for sulfur (S).\n2. Calculate the number of bonding electrons.\n3. Calculate the number of non-bonding electrons.\n4. Calculate the formal charge.\n\nStep 1: Determine the number of valence electrons for sulfur (S).\nSulfur is in group 16 (or group 6A) of the periodic table, so it has 6 valence electrons.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of bonding electrons.\nIn the sulfate ion, sulfur forms four single bonds with four oxygen atoms. Each single bond consists of 2 electrons, so there are a total of 4 bonds × 2 electrons/bond = 8 bonding electrons.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the number of non-bonding electrons.\nSince sulfur has 6 valence electrons and there are 8 bonding electrons, the number of non-bonding electrons is 6 - 8 = -2.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the formal charge.\nThe formal charge of sulfur in the sulfate ion is the difference between the number of valence electrons and the sum of the bonding and non-bonding electrons:\n\nFormal charge = Valence electrons - (Bonding electrons + Non-bonding electrons)\nFormal charge = 6 - (8 + -2)\nFormal charge = 6 - 6\nFormal charge = 0\n\nTherefore, the formal charge of sulfur in the sulfate ion (SO₄²⁻) is 0."
