    "message_2": "Sulfur dioxide (SO2) has a bent molecular geometry due to the presence of a lone pair of electrons on the sulfur atom. The sulfur atom is the central atom, and it forms two double bonds with the two oxygen atoms. The sulfur atom also has one lone pair of electrons.\n\nSO2 has a resonance structure, which means that the double bonds between sulfur and oxygen atoms can switch between the two oxygen atoms. This results in an average bond order of 1.5 for each S-O bond.\n\nBased on the VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) theory, the electron pairs around the central sulfur atom will repel each other and arrange themselves to be as far apart as possible. The molecule has three electron groups around the sulfur atom: two double bonds and one lone pair. This arrangement corresponds to a trigonal planar electron geometry.\n\nHowever, the molecular geometry is determined by the positions of the atoms, not the electron groups. Since there is a lone pair on the sulfur atom, the molecular geometry is bent or V-shaped. In a bent molecular geometry with three electron groups, the bond angle between the two oxygen atoms is slightly less than 120 degrees. The presence of the lone pair causes a greater repulsion, which pushes the oxygen atoms closer together, resulting in a smaller bond angle.\n\nTherefore, the predicted bond angle of the sulfur dioxide (SO2) molecule is slightly less than 120 degrees."
