    "message_2": "C6H5OH is the molecular formula for phenol, which is a weak acid. To justify this, let's analyze the chemical bonding and electronegativity of the atoms involved in the molecule.\n\nPhenol consists of a benzene ring (C6H5) with a hydroxyl group (OH) attached to one of the carbon atoms. The benzene ring is composed of six carbon atoms with alternating single and double bonds, creating a resonance structure that delocalizes the electrons across the entire ring. This delocalization provides stability to the molecule.\n\nThe hydroxyl group (OH) is the key to understanding the acidity of phenol. The oxygen atom in the hydroxyl group is more electronegative than the carbon and hydrogen atoms, meaning it attracts electrons more strongly. This causes the oxygen-hydrogen bond to be polar, with a partial negative charge on the oxygen atom and a partial positive charge on the hydrogen atom.\n\nWhen phenol is dissolved in water, the polar O-H bond can break, releasing a hydrogen ion (H+) and leaving behind a phenoxide ion (C6H5O-). This process is characteristic of an acidic substance. However, the acidity of phenol is weak compared to strong acids like hydrochloric acid (HCl) or sulfuric acid (H2SO4). This is because the negative charge on the phenoxide ion is delocalized across the benzene ring, which provides some stability to the ion, but not enough to make phenol a strong acid.\n\nIn summary, the expected acidity of a molecule with the formula C6H5OH (phenol) can be attributed to the presence of the polar hydroxyl group and the electronegativity of the oxygen atom. Phenol is a weak acid due to the delocalization of the negative charge on the phenoxide ion across the benzene ring."
