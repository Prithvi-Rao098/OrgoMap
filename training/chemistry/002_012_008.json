    "message_2": "To determine the bond order and bond length of N2 and NO molecules, we need to look at their molecular orbital diagrams and apply the molecular orbital theory.\n\nFor the Nitrogen molecule (N2):\n\nN2 has a total of 10 valence electrons (5 from each nitrogen atom). The molecular orbital diagram for N2 is as follows:\n\n1σ2 → 1σ*2 → 2σ2 → 2σ*2 → 2π4\n\nBond order for N2 = (number of electrons in bonding orbitals - number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\nBond order for N2 = (8 - 4) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2\n\nThe bond order for N2 is 2, which means it has a triple bond between the two nitrogen atoms. The bond length of N2 is approximately 1.10 Å (angstroms).\n\nFor the Nitric Oxide molecule (NO):\n\nNO has a total of 11 valence electrons (5 from nitrogen and 6 from oxygen). The molecular orbital diagram for NO is as follows:\n\n1σ2 → 1σ*2 → 2σ2 → 2σ*2 → 2π4 → 3σ1\n\nBond order for NO = (number of electrons in bonding orbitals - number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\nBond order for NO = (9 - 4) / 2 = 5 / 2 = 2.5\n\nThe bond order for NO is 2.5, which means it has a bond between a double and triple bond. The bond length of NO is approximately 1.15 Å (angstroms).\n\nComparison of bond lengths:\n\nThe bond length of N2 (1.10 Å) is shorter than that of NO (1.15 Å). This is because N2 has a triple bond, which is stronger and shorter than the bond in NO, which has a bond order between a double and triple bond. The stronger the bond, the shorter the bond length, as the atoms are held more closely together."
