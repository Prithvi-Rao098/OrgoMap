    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy of formation of methane (CH4), we need to use the standard enthalpies of formation for CO2 and H2O, as well as the balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane:\n\nCH4 (g) + 2 O2 (g) → CO2 (g) + 2 H2O (l)\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for this reaction (ΔH°) can be calculated using Hess's law, which states that the enthalpy change for a reaction is the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of the products minus the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of the reactants:\n\nΔH° = [ΔHf°(CO2) + 2ΔHf°(H2O)] - [ΔHf°(CH4) + 2ΔHf°(O2)]\n\nSince O2 is an element in its standard state, its standard enthalpy of formation is zero. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\nΔH° = [ΔHf°(CO2) + 2ΔHf°(H2O)] - ΔHf°(CH4)\n\nWe are given the standard enthalpies of formation for CO2 and H2O:\n\nΔHf°(CO2) = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(H2O) = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the combustion of methane (ΔH°) is also known:\n\nΔH° = -890.4 kJ/mol (This value can be found in standard chemistry reference materials.)\n\nNow we can solve for the standard enthalpy of formation of methane (ΔHf°(CH4)):\n\n-890.4 kJ/mol = [(-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2(-285.8 kJ/mol)] - ΔHf°(CH4)\n\n-890.4 kJ/mol = -965.1 kJ/mol - ΔHf°(CH4)\n\nΔHf°(CH4) = -965.1 kJ/mol + 890.4 kJ/mol\n\nΔHf°(CH4) = -74.7 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy of formation of methane (CH4) is -74.7 kJ/mol."
