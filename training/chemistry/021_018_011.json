    "message_2": "To predict the boiling point of ethanol compared to propane, we need to consider their intermolecular forces. The two main types of intermolecular forces are van der Waals forces (London dispersion forces) and hydrogen bonding.\n\nEthanol (C2H5OH) has a polar hydroxyl group (-OH) that can form hydrogen bonds with other ethanol molecules. Hydrogen bonding is a strong intermolecular force, which results in a higher boiling point.\n\nPropane (C3H8) is a nonpolar molecule, and its intermolecular forces are limited to van der Waals forces (London dispersion forces). These forces are weaker than hydrogen bonding, leading to a lower boiling point.\n\nBased on their intermolecular forces, ethanol is expected to have a higher boiling point than propane. The actual boiling points are:\n\n- Ethanol: 78.37째C (173.07째F)\n- Propane: -42째C (-44째F)\n\nAs predicted, ethanol has a higher boiling point than propane due to the presence of hydrogen bonding in ethanol."
