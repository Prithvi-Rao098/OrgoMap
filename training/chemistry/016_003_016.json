    "message_2": "The bond dissociation energy required to break the carbon-hydrogen bond in methane is already given in the problem statement. The C-H bond dissociation energy is 413 kJ/mol. There is no need to use the other bond dissociation energies (C-C, C=C, and H-H) as they are not relevant to breaking the C-H bond in methane."
