    "message_2": "To calculate the cell potential for the electrochemical reaction, we first need to balance the half-reactions and then combine them to obtain the overall balanced reaction. The given half-reactions are:\n\nFe3+(aq) + e- --> Fe2+(aq)    (E° = 0.77 V)\nMnO4-(aq) + 8H+(aq) + 5e- --> Mn2+(aq) + 4H2O (E° = 1.51 V)\n\nTo balance the electrons, we need to multiply the first half-reaction by 5 and the second half-reaction by 1:\n\n5(Fe3+(aq) + e- --> Fe2+(aq))    (E° = 0.77 V)\n1(MnO4-(aq) + 8H+(aq) + 5e- --> Mn2+(aq) + 4H2O) (E° = 1.51 V)\n\nNow the balanced half-reactions are:\n\n5Fe3+(aq) + 5e- --> 5Fe2+(aq)    (E° = 0.77 V)\nMnO4-(aq) + 8H+(aq) + 5e- --> Mn2+(aq) + 4H2O (E° = 1.51 V)\n\nNow we can combine the balanced half-reactions to obtain the overall balanced reaction:\n\n5Fe2+(aq) + MnO4-(aq) + 8H+(aq) --> 5Fe3+(aq) + Mn2+(aq) + 4H2O\n\nNext, we need to calculate the cell potential (E°cell) for the overall balanced reaction. The cell potential is the difference between the reduction potentials of the two half-reactions:\n\nE°cell = E°cathode - E°anode\n\nIn this case, the MnO4- half-reaction has a higher reduction potential, so it will act as the cathode, and the Fe3+ half-reaction will act as the anode:\n\nE°cell = 1.51 V - 0.77 V\nE°cell = 0.74 V\n\nSo, the cell potential for the electrochemical reaction of the given half-reactions at 25°C in a standard state is 0.74 V."
