    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the complete combustion of methane, we need to use the following equation:\n\nΔH_combustion = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the complete combustion of methane is:\n\nCH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l)\n\nNow, we need to find the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔH_f) for all the reactants and products involved in the reaction. We are given the ΔH_f values for CH4(g) and H2O(l), but we need to find the ΔH_f values for O2(g) and CO2(g).\n\nFor O2(g), since it is an element in its standard state, its ΔH_f value is 0 kJ/mol.\n\nFor CO2(g), the standard enthalpy of formation is -393.5 kJ/mol (you can find this value in a standard thermodynamic table or chemistry reference).\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔH_combustion = [1 × (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 × (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [1 × (-74.8 kJ/mol) + 2 × 0 kJ/mol]\n\nΔH_combustion = (-393.5 - 571.6) - (-74.8)\n\nΔH_combustion = -965.1 + 74.8\n\nΔH_combustion = -890.3 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change for the complete combustion of methane at constant pressure and 298 K is -890.3 kJ/mol."
