    "message_2": "The addition of a catalyst to a chemical reaction does not affect the equilibrium position. A catalyst works by lowering the activation energy of the reaction, which increases the rate at which the reaction proceeds in both the forward and reverse directions. However, it does not change the equilibrium constant (K) or the position of the equilibrium.\n\nLe Chatelier's principle states that if a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in concentration, temperature, or pressure, the system will adjust the position of the equilibrium to counteract the change. Since a catalyst does not change any of these factors, it does not affect the equilibrium position.\n\nLet's consider a specific reaction to illustrate this point:\n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) â‡Œ 2NH3(g)\n\nThe equilibrium constant (K) for this reaction can be expressed as:\n\nK = [NH3]^2 / ([N2] * [H2]^3)\n\nSuppose we add a catalyst to this reaction. The catalyst will increase the rate of the forward reaction (formation of NH3) and the rate of the reverse reaction (decomposition of NH3) equally. As a result, the concentrations of N2, H2, and NH3 will still follow the same equilibrium constant (K) relationship, and the position of the equilibrium will remain unchanged.\n\nIn conclusion, adding a catalyst to a chemical reaction increases the rate at which the reaction reaches equilibrium but does not change the equilibrium position or the equilibrium constant (K)."
