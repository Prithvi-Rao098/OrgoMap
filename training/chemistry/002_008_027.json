    "message_2": "To calculate the percent composition of copper sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO4•5H2O), we first need to determine the molar mass of each element in the compound and then find the percentage of each element.\n\n1. Determine the molar mass of each element in the compound:\n- Copper (Cu): 63.55 g/mol\n- Sulfur (S): 32.07 g/mol\n- Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol\n- Hydrogen (H): 1.01 g/mol\n\n2. Calculate the molar mass of the compound:\n- CuSO4: (1 x 63.55) + (1 x 32.07) + (4 x 16.00) = 63.55 + 32.07 + 64.00 = 159.62 g/mol\n- 5H2O: (5 x [(2 x 1.01) + (1 x 16.00)]) = 5 x (2.02 + 16.00) = 5 x 18.02 = 90.10 g/mol\n- CuSO4•5H2O: 159.62 + 90.10 = 249.72 g/mol\n\n3. Calculate the percent composition of each element:\n- %Cu: (63.55 g/mol / 249.72 g/mol) x 100 = 25.45%\n- %S: (32.07 g/mol / 249.72 g/mol) x 100 = 12.85%\n- %O (in CuSO4): (64.00 g/mol / 249.72 g/mol) x 100 = 25.64%\n- %H: (10.10 g/mol / 249.72 g/mol) x 100 = 4.05%\n- %O (in 5H2O): (80.00 g/mol / 249.72 g/mol) x 100 = 32.01%\n\nThe percent composition of copper sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO4•5H2O) is:\n- Copper (Cu): 25.45%\n- Sulfur (S): 12.85%\n- Oxygen (O) in CuSO4: 25.64%\n- Hydrogen (H): 4.05%\n- Oxygen (O) in 5H2O: 32.01%"
