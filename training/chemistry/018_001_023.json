    "message_2": "To determine the rate law for the reaction, we need to analyze the experimental data and find the relationship between the concentrations of the reactants and the initial reaction rate. The general rate law for a reaction is given by:\n\nRate = k [A]^m [B]^n\n\nwhere k is the rate constant, [A] and [B] are the concentrations of the reactants, and m and n are the reaction orders with respect to A and B, respectively.\n\nLet's analyze the data:\n\n1. Compare experiments 1 and 2:\n- [H₂O₂] doubles (0.100 M to 0.200 M), while [KI] remains constant (0.100 M).\n- The initial reaction rate quadruples (1.00 x 10⁻⁴ M/s to 4.00 x 10⁻⁴ M/s).\n\nThis indicates that when [H₂O₂] doubles, the rate increases by a factor of 2^2 = 4. Therefore, the reaction is second order with respect to H₂O₂ (m = 2).\n\n2. Compare experiments 2 and 3:\n- [H₂O₂] remains constant (0.200 M), while [KI] doubles (0.100 M to 0.200 M).\n- The initial reaction rate doubles (4.00 x 10⁻⁴ M/s to 8.00 x 10⁻⁴ M/s).\n\nThis indicates that when [KI] doubles, the rate increases by a factor of 2^1 = 2. Therefore, the reaction is first order with respect to KI (n = 1).\n\nNow we can write the rate law for the reaction:\n\nRate = k [H₂O₂]^2 [KI]^1"
