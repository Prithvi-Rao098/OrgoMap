    "message_1": "What is the acidity or basicity of a molecule with the chemical formula HCOOH?",
    "message_2": "HCOOH, also known as formic acid, is an acidic molecule. It is a weak acid that can donate a proton (H+) to a solution, increasing the concentration of H+ ions and thus lowering the pH. The acidic nature of formic acid is due to the presence of the carboxyl group (-COOH), which is a common feature in many organic acids."
