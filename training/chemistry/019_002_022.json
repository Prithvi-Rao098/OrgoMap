    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy of formation of sodium chloride (NaCl), we can use the given data and the Hess's Law. Hess's Law states that the total enthalpy change for a reaction is the same, regardless of the path taken.\n\nWe can use the following reactions:\n\n1) NaOH(s) → Na+(aq) + OH-(aq)      ΔH1 = -469.14 kJ/mol\n2) HCl(g) → H+(aq) + Cl-(aq)        ΔH2 = -92.31 kJ/mol\n3) H+(aq) + OH-(aq) → H2O(l)         ΔH3 = -57.24 kJ/mol\n\nWe want to find the enthalpy change for the following reaction:\n\n4) Na+(aq) + Cl-(aq) → NaCl(s)       ΔH4 = ?\n\nTo find ΔH4, we can manipulate the given reactions and add them together:\n\n1) NaOH(s) → Na+(aq) + OH-(aq)      ΔH1 = -469.14 kJ/mol\n2) HCl(g) → H+(aq) + Cl-(aq)        ΔH2 = -92.31 kJ/mol\n3) H+(aq) + OH-(aq) → H2O(l)         ΔH3 = -57.24 kJ/mol\n\nReverse reaction 3:\n3') H2O(l) → H+(aq) + OH-(aq)       ΔH3' = +57.24 kJ/mol\n\nNow, add reactions 1, 2, and 3':\n\n1 + 2 + 3') NaOH(s) + HCl(g) → NaCl(s) + H2O(l)      ΔH = -469.14 + (-92.31) + 57.24\n\nΔH = -504.21 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy of formation of sodium chloride (NaCl) is -504.21 kJ/mol."
