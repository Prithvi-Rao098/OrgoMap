    "message_2": "The chemical equation for the complete combustion of propane (C3H8) is:\n\nC3H8 + 5O2 â†’ 3CO2 + 4H2O\n\nIn this reaction, one molecule of propane reacts with five molecules of oxygen (O2) to produce three molecules of carbon dioxide (CO2) and four molecules of water (H2O). Therefore, for the complete combustion of propane, five molecules of oxygen are required for each molecule of propane."
