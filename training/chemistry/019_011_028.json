    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change of the formation of water (H2O), we can use the following equation:\n\nΔHf°(H2O) = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants)\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the formation of water is:\n\nH2(g) + 1/2 O2(g) → H2O(g)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given standard enthalpies of formation:\n\nΔHf°(H2O) = [1 × ΔHf°(H2O(g))] - [1 × ΔHf°(H2(g)) + 1/2 × ΔHf°(O2(g))]\n\nSince the standard enthalpy of formation for hydrogen gas (H2) and oxygen gas (O2) are both 0 kJ/mol, the equation simplifies to:\n\nΔHf°(H2O) = [1 × (-241.8 kJ/mol)] - [0 + 0]\n\nΔHf°(H2O) = -241.8 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change of the formation of water (H2O) is -241.8 kJ/mol."
