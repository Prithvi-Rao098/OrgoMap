    "message_2": "The vibrational frequencies of a CO molecule and a CO2 molecule can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nν = (1/2π) * √(k/μ)\n\nwhere ν is the vibrational frequency, k is the force constant, and μ is the reduced mass of the molecule. The reduced mass can be calculated using the formula:\n\nμ = (m1 * m2) / (m1 + m2)\n\nwhere m1 and m2 are the masses of the two atoms in the molecule.\n\nFor CO molecule:\nm1 (C) = 12 amu, m2 (O) = 16 amu\nμ = (12 * 16) / (12 + 16) = 192 / 28 = 6.857 amu\n\nThe force constant (k) for CO is approximately 1857 N/m. Now, we can calculate the vibrational frequency:\n\nν = (1/2π) * √(1857 / (6.857 * 1.66 * 10^-27 kg/amu))\nν ≈ 2143 cm^-1\n\nFor CO2 molecule, there are two vibrational modes: symmetric stretching and asymmetric stretching.\n\nSymmetric stretching:\nμ = (m1 * m2) / (m1 + m2) = (12 * 16) / (12 + 16) = 6.857 amu\nk ≈ 534 N/m\nν ≈ 667 cm^-1\n\nAsymmetric stretching:\nμ = (m1 * m2) / (m1 + m2) = (16 * 16) / (16 + 16) = 8 amu\nk ≈ 1900 N/m\nν ≈ 2349 cm^-1\n\nTo identify these frequencies experimentally, vibrational spectroscopy techniques such as Infrared (IR) spectroscopy or Raman spectroscopy can be used.\n\nInfrared (IR) spectroscopy:\nIn this technique, a molecule is exposed to infrared radiation, and the absorption of the radiation is measured. Molecules absorb specific frequencies of IR radiation that correspond to their vibrational frequencies. By analyzing the absorption spectrum, the vibrational frequencies of the molecule can be determined.\n\nRaman spectroscopy:\nIn Raman spectroscopy, a monochromatic light (usually from a laser) is scattered off a sample, and the frequency shift of the scattered light is measured. The frequency shift corresponds to the vibrational frequencies of the molecule. Raman spectroscopy is particularly useful for molecules that do not absorb IR radiation well or for samples that have strong IR absorption from other components.\n\nBy using either of these techniques, the vibrational frequencies of CO and CO2 molecules can be identified experimentally."
