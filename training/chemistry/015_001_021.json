    "message_2": "Molecular Orbital (MO) Theory is a method for understanding the electronic structure and bonding in diatomic molecules by considering the combination of atomic orbitals to form molecular orbitals. Molecular orbitals are the allowed energy states for electrons in a molecule, and they can be bonding, non-bonding, or anti-bonding in nature.\n\nIn the case of H2 (hydrogen molecule), each hydrogen atom has one electron in its 1s atomic orbital. According to MO theory, when two hydrogen atoms approach each other, their atomic orbitals overlap and combine to form two molecular orbitals: one bonding (σ1s) and one anti-bonding (σ1s*). The bonding molecular orbital, σ1s, is lower in energy than the original atomic orbitals, while the anti-bonding molecular orbital, σ1s*, is higher in energy. The two electrons from the hydrogen atoms will occupy the lower energy bonding orbital (σ1s), resulting in a stable covalent bond between the two hydrogen atoms. The bond order, which indicates the number of chemical bonds between a pair of atoms, can be calculated as (number of electrons in bonding orbitals - number of electrons in anti-bonding orbitals)/2. In the case of H2, the bond order is (2-0)/2 = 1, indicating a single bond between the two hydrogen atoms.\n\nIn the case of N2 (nitrogen molecule), each nitrogen atom has five valence electrons: two in the 2s orbital and three in the 2p orbitals. When two nitrogen atoms approach each other, their atomic orbitals combine to form molecular orbitals. The 2s orbitals combine to form a bonding (σ2s) and an anti-bonding (σ2s*) molecular orbital, while the 2p orbitals combine to form three bonding (one σ2p and two π2p) and three anti-bonding (one σ2p* and two π2p*) molecular orbitals.\n\nThe ten valence electrons from the two nitrogen atoms will fill the molecular orbitals in the order of increasing energy: σ2s, σ2s*, σ2p, π2p, π2p, σ2p*, π2p*, and π2p*. The first eight electrons will fill the σ2s, σ2s*, σ2p, and π2p orbitals, leaving two electrons in the π2p orbitals. The bond order for N2 can be calculated as (number of electrons in bonding orbitals - number of electrons in anti-bonding orbitals)/2 = (8-2)/2 = 3, indicating a triple bond between the two nitrogen atoms.\n\nIn summary, the molecular orbital theory explains the electronic structure and bonding in diatomic molecules like H2 and N2 by considering the combination of atomic orbitals to form molecular orbitals. The distribution of electrons in these molecular orbitals determines the bond order and the nature of the bond between the atoms in the molecule."
