Unfortunately, the information provided only gives the initial concentrations. \n\nHowever, we can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to help us find the equilibrium concentrations:\n\n```\n         N2(g)   +   3H2(g)   <->   2NH3(g)\nInitial:  0.10 M        0.20 M          0.00 M\nChange:  -x M          -3x M          +2x M\nEquilibrium: 0.10-x M   0.20-3x M      2x M\n```\n\nHere, x represents the change in concentration of each species as the reaction proceeds to equilibrium.\n\nTo find the value of x, we need the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction at 298K. Unfortunately, this information is not provided. If you can provide the Kc value for this reaction at 298K, we can proceed to find the equilibrium concentrations and solve the problem."
