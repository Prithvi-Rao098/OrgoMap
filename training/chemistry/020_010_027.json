    "message_1": "If a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid (CH3COOH) has an equilibrium constant of 1.8 x 10^-5 at 25 degrees Celsius, what is the concentration of hydroxide ions ([OH-]) in the solution when 0.02 moles of sodium acetate (NaCH3COO) are added, assuming that the volume does not change?",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the concentration of acetate ions (CH3COO-) after adding sodium acetate. Since sodium acetate dissociates completely in water, the concentration of acetate ions will be equal to the moles of sodium acetate added divided by the volume of the solution. Assuming the volume of the solution is 1 L (since the concentration of acetic acid is given in molarity), the concentration of acetate ions will be:\n\n[CH3COO-] = 0.02 moles / 1 L = 0.02 M\n\nNow, we can use the equilibrium constant expression for the dissociation of acetic acid:\n\nKa = [CH3COO-][H+] / [CH3COOH]\n\nWe know the initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.1 M, and the equilibrium constant Ka is 1.8 x 10^-5. We can set up an equation to solve for the concentration of hydrogen ions [H+]:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 = (0.02)([H+]) / (0.1 - [H+])\n\nRearranging and solving for [H+]:\n\n[H+] = 9 x 10^-5 M\n\nNow, we can use the relationship between hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions in water:\n\nKw = [H+][OH-] = 1 x 10^-14\n\nWhere Kw is the ion product constant for water at 25 degrees Celsius. Solving for [OH-]:\n\n[OH-] = (1 x 10^-14) / (9 x 10^-5)\n\n[OH-] = 1.11 x 10^-10 M\n\nSo, the concentration of hydroxide ions in the solution is 1.11 x 10^-10 M."
