    "message_2": "To find the molarity of the HCl solution, we can use the concept of the balanced chemical equation and the formula for molarity. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction between HCl and NaOH is:\n\nHCl (aq) + NaOH (aq) → NaCl (aq) + H2O (l)\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of HCl reacts with 1 mole of NaOH.\n\nNow, we can use the formula for molarity:\n\nMolarity (M) = moles of solute / liters of solution\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of NaOH:\n\nMoles of NaOH = Molarity of NaOH × Volume of NaOH (in liters)\nMoles of NaOH = 0.1 M × 75 mL × (1 L / 1000 mL) = 0.0075 moles\n\nSince 1 mole of HCl reacts with 1 mole of NaOH, the moles of HCl are also 0.0075 moles.\n\nNow, we can find the molarity of the HCl solution:\n\nMolarity of HCl = moles of HCl / volume of HCl (in liters)\nMolarity of HCl = 0.0075 moles / (50 mL × 1 L / 1000 mL) = 0.0075 moles / 0.05 L = 0.15 M\n\nSo, the molarity of the HCl solution is 0.15 M."
