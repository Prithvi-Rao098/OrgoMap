    "message_2": "To determine the change in solubility of AgCl in a saturated solution when the concentration of AgNO3 is increased from 0.1 M to 0.2 M at 25°C, we need to use the solubility product constant (Ksp) and the common ion effect.\n\nThe balanced equation for the dissolution of AgCl is:\nAgCl (s) ⇌ Ag+ (aq) + Cl- (aq)\n\nThe Ksp of AgCl at 25°C is 1.77 x 10^-10.\n\nInitially, let's assume the solubility of AgCl is S mol/L in the presence of 0.1 M AgNO3. Since AgNO3 is a strong electrolyte, it will dissociate completely, and the concentration of Ag+ ions will be 0.1 M + S. The concentration of Cl- ions will be S.\n\nKsp = [Ag+] [Cl-]\n1.77 x 10^-10 = (0.1 + S)(S)\n\nNow, let's consider the new scenario where the concentration of AgNO3 is increased to 0.2 M. The concentration of Ag+ ions will be 0.2 M + S', and the concentration of Cl- ions will be S'.\n\nKsp = [Ag+] [Cl-]\n1.77 x 10^-10 = (0.2 + S')(S')\n\nNow, we need to solve these two equations to find the change in solubility (ΔS = S' - S).\n\nFrom the first equation:\nS ≈ 1.77 x 10^-9 (since S << 0.1)\n\nFrom the second equation:\nS' ≈ 8.85 x 10^-10 (since S' << 0.2)\n\nNow, find the change in solubility (ΔS):\nΔS = S' - S\nΔS ≈ 8.85 x 10^-10 - 1.77 x 10^-9\nΔS ≈ -8.85 x 10^-10\n\nThe change in solubility of AgCl when the concentration of AgNO3 is increased from 0.1 M to 0.2 M at 25°C is approximately -8.85 x 10^-10 mol/L. This means that the solubility of AgCl decreases due to the common ion effect."
