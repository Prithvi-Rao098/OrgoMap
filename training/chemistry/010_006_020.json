    "message_2": "To find the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in a solution with a pH of 3.5, we can use the pH formula:\n\npH = -log10[H+]\n\nwhere pH is the measure of acidity or alkalinity of a solution, and [H+] is the concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution.\n\nWe can rearrange the formula to solve for [H+]:\n\n[H+] = 10^(-pH)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given pH value of 3.5:\n\n[H+] = 10^(-3.5)\n\n[H+] ≈ 3.16 × 10^(-4) M\n\nSo, the concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution is approximately 3.16 × 10^(-4) M. The reduction potential of the hydrogen ion (-0.414 V) is not needed to solve this problem, as it is not directly related to the pH or hydrogen ion concentration."
