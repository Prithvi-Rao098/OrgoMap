    "message_1": "What is the bond enthalpy of the carbon-carbon double bond in ethene (C2H4) if it requires 615 kJ/mol of energy to break the bond?",
    "message_2": "The bond enthalpy of the carbon-carbon double bond in ethene (C2H4) is 615 kJ/mol. This is because bond enthalpy refers to the amount of energy required to break a specific bond in a molecule, and in this case, it is given that it takes 615 kJ/mol of energy to break the carbon-carbon double bond in ethene."
