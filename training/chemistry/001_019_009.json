    "message_2": "The reaction of 1-bromobutane (C4H9Br) with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in aqueous solution is a nucleophilic substitution reaction. In this case, it is an SN2 reaction, where the hydroxide ion (OH-) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon atom bonded to the bromine atom. The bromine atom is a good leaving group, and it leaves as a bromide ion (Br-). \n\nThe products of this reaction are 1-butanol (C4H9OH) and sodium bromide (NaBr). The overall reaction can be represented as:\n\nC4H9Br + NaOH â†’ C4H9OH + NaBr\n\nThe reason for this reaction is that the hydroxide ion is a strong nucleophile and can easily attack the electrophilic carbon atom in 1-bromobutane. The bromine atom is a good leaving group due to its relatively large size and ability to stabilize the negative charge when it leaves as a bromide ion. This results in the formation of 1-butanol and sodium bromide as the products."
