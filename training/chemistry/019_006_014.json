    "message_2": "The balanced chemical equation for the reaction between hydrogen gas (H2) and iodine gas (I2) to form hydrogen iodide (HI) is:\n\nH2(g) + I2(g) â‡Œ 2HI(g)\n\nTo find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for this reaction, we can use the equilibrium concentrations of the reactants and products. According to the problem, the initial concentrations of H2 and I2 are both 0.10 M, and at equilibrium, the concentration of HI is 0.05 M. \n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction shows that 1 mole of H2 reacts with 1 mole of I2 to produce 2 moles of HI, we can determine the change in concentrations for each species:\n\nChange in [H2] = Change in [I2] = -0.05 M (since they are being consumed)\nChange in [HI] = +0.10 M (since it is being produced)\n\nNow, we can find the equilibrium concentrations for each species:\n\n[H2]eq = 0.10 M - 0.05 M = 0.05 M\n[I2]eq = 0.10 M - 0.05 M = 0.05 M\n[HI]eq = 0.00 M + 0.10 M = 0.10 M\n\nNow we can use the equilibrium expression for Kc:\n\nKc = [HI]^2 / ([H2] * [I2])\n\nPlugging in the equilibrium concentrations:\n\nKc = (0.10)^2 / (0.05 * 0.05) = 0.01 / 0.0025 = 4\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for this reaction at 298 K is 4."
