    "message_2": "The synthesis of ibuprofen from 2-methylpropylbenzene and carbon dioxide using a carbonylation reaction mechanism involves several steps. The optimal reaction conditions for each step are as follows:\n\n1. Hydroxylation of 2-methylpropylbenzene: The first step is the hydroxylation of 2-methylpropylbenzene to form 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanol. This can be achieved using a strong oxidizing agent like potassium permanganate (KMnO4) or osmium tetroxide (OsO4) in an alkaline medium. The reaction is typically carried out at room temperature (25°C) for several hours.\n\n2. Carbonylation of 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanol: The next step is the carbonylation of 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanol to form 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionic acid. This can be achieved using carbon monoxide (CO) as the carbonylating agent in the presence of a transition metal catalyst like palladium (Pd) or rhodium (Rh) complexed with a phosphine ligand. The reaction is typically carried out at elevated temperatures (100-150°C) and high pressure (50-100 atm) for several hours.\n\n3. Esterification of 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionic acid: The final step is the esterification of 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionic acid to form ibuprofen. This can be achieved using an alcohol (e.g., isopropanol) in the presence of an acid catalyst like sulfuric acid (H2SO4) or p-toluenesulfonic acid (p-TsOH). The reaction is typically carried out at reflux temperature (around 80-90°C) for several hours.\n\nIn summary, the optimal reaction conditions for the synthesis of ibuprofen from 2-methylpropylbenzene and carbon dioxide using a carbonylation reaction mechanism are:\n\n1. Hydroxylation: Room temperature (25°C), strong oxidizing agent, alkaline medium.\n2. Carbonylation: Elevated temperature (100-150°C), high pressure (50-100 atm), transition metal catalyst, phosphine ligand.\n3. Esterification: Reflux temperature (80-90°C), acid catalyst, alcohol as the esterifying agent."
