    "message_2": "To find the boiling point of a solution containing 50 g of glucose (C6H12O6) in 500 mL of water, we can use the boiling point elevation formula:\n\nΔTb = Kb * molality * i\n\nwhere ΔTb is the boiling point elevation, Kb is the ebullioscopic constant for water (0.512 °C/molal), molality is the moles of solute per kilogram of solvent, and i is the van't Hoff factor (which is 1 for glucose, as it does not dissociate in water).\n\nFirst, we need to find the molality of the solution. To do this, we need to find the moles of glucose and the mass of the solvent (water) in kilograms.\n\nMoles of glucose = mass of glucose / molar mass of glucose\nMoles of glucose = 50 g / (6 * 12.01 g/mol + 12 * 1.01 g/mol + 6 * 16.00 g/mol)\nMoles of glucose = 50 g / 180.18 g/mol ≈ 0.277 moles\n\nThe mass of 500 mL of water is approximately 500 g (since the density of water is about 1 g/mL), which is equal to 0.5 kg.\n\nNow we can find the molality:\n\nMolality = moles of glucose / mass of water in kg\nMolality = 0.277 moles / 0.5 kg ≈ 0.554 molal\n\nNow we can use the boiling point elevation formula:\n\nΔTb = Kb * molality * i\nΔTb = 0.512 °C/molal * 0.554 molal * 1\nΔTb ≈ 0.283 °C\n\nThe boiling point of water is 100 °C, so the boiling point of the solution is:\n\nBoiling point of solution = boiling point of water + ΔTb\nBoiling point of solution = 100 °C + 0.283 °C ≈ 100.283 °C\n\nSo, the boiling point of the solution containing 50 g of glucose in 500 mL of water, assuming ideal behavior, is approximately 100.283 °C."
