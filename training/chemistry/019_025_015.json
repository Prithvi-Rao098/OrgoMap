The ΔHf° of NaNO2 and NaCl are -463.2 kJ/mol and -411.2 kJ/mol, respectively. Assume that the reaction is conducted at a constant pressure and temperature of 298 K.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the following formula:\n\nΔH°(reaction) = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants)\n\nThe reaction is:\n[Co(en)2Cl2]Cl + NaNO2 → [Co(en)2(NO2)2]Cl + NaCl\n\nΔHf° values are given as:\n[Co(en)2Cl2]Cl: -288 kJ/mol\n[Co(en)2(NO2)2]Cl: -136 kJ/mol\nNaNO2: -463.2 kJ/mol\nNaCl: -411.2 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nΔH°(reaction) = ([-136 kJ/mol] + [-411.2 kJ/mol]) - ([-288 kJ/mol] + [-463.2 kJ/mol])\n\nΔH°(reaction) = (-547.2 kJ/mol) - (-751.2 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH°(reaction) = 204 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change for the reaction is 204 kJ/mol."
