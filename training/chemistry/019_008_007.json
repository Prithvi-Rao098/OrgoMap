    "message_2": "To calculate the standard electrode potential for the redox reaction, we need to subtract the standard electrode potential of the anode (Zn2+/Zn) from the standard electrode potential of the cathode (Cu2+/Cu).\n\nIn this reaction, Zn(s) is being oxidized to Zn2+(aq), so the Zn2+/Zn half-cell is the anode. Cu2+(aq) is being reduced to Cu(s), so the Cu2+/Cu half-cell is the cathode.\n\nStandard electrode potential (E°) for the redox reaction = E°(cathode) - E°(anode)\n\nE°(redox) = E°(Cu2+/Cu) - E°(Zn2+/Zn)\nE°(redox) = (+0.34V) - (-0.76V)\n\nE°(redox) = +0.34V + 0.76V\nE°(redox) = +1.10V\n\nThe standard electrode potential for the redox reaction Zn(s) + Cu2+(aq) → Zn2+(aq) + Cu(s) is +1.10V."
