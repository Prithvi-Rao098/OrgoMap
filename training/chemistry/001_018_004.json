    "message_2": "To find the pH of the solution, we can use the formula for the ionization constant of a weak acid (Ka):\n\nKa = [H+][A-]/[HA]\n\nWhere [H+] is the concentration of hydrogen ions, [A-] is the concentration of acetate ions, and [HA] is the concentration of acetic acid.\n\nSince the initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.1 M (0.1 moles in 1 liter of water), we can set up the equation as follows:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 = [H+][0.1 - H+]/[0.1]\n\nLet x = [H+]. Then the equation becomes:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 = x(0.1 - x)/0.1\n\nSolve for x:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 = x - x^2\nx^2 - x + 1.8 x 10^-5 = 0\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to solve for x:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -1, and c = 1.8 x 10^-5. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (1 ± √((-1)^2 - 4(1)(1.8 x 10^-5))) / 2(1)\nx = (1 ± √(1 - 7.2 x 10^-5)) / 2\n\nSince x is a small value, we can approximate the value of x by taking the positive square root:\n\nx ≈ (1 + √(1 - 7.2 x 10^-5)) / 2\nx ≈ (1 + √(0.999928)) / 2\nx ≈ (1 + 0.999964) / 2\nx ≈ 1.999964 / 2\nx ≈ 0.999982\n\nNow, we can find the pH of the solution using the formula:\n\npH = -log[H+]\n\npH = -log(0.999982)\npH ≈ 2.6\n\nTherefore, the pH of the solution is approximately 2.6."
