    "message_2": "The activity of a radioactive sample can be measured using a Geiger-Muller (GM) counter through the following steps:\n\n1. Preparation of the sample: First, prepare the radioactive sample by placing it in a suitable container or holder. Ensure that the sample is properly sealed to prevent any contamination.\n\n2. Set up the Geiger-Muller counter: Place the GM counter near the sample, ensuring that the detector (usually a GM tube) is facing the sample. The distance between the sample and the detector should be kept constant throughout the experiment to maintain accuracy.\n\n3. Calibration: Before starting the measurement, calibrate the GM counter using a known radioactive source with a specific activity. This will help in determining the efficiency of the GM counter and the conversion factor to calculate the activity of the unknown sample.\n\n4. Background radiation measurement: Measure the background radiation by turning on the GM counter without the presence of the radioactive sample. Record the counts per minute (CPM) or counts per second (CPS) for a specific time interval (e.g., 10 minutes). This will help in accounting for the natural background radiation during the actual measurement.\n\n5. Sample measurement: Place the radioactive sample in front of the GM counter and turn on the device. Record the counts per minute (CPM) or counts per second (CPS) for the same time interval used during the background radiation measurement (e.g., 10 minutes).\n\n6. Subtract background radiation: Subtract the background radiation counts from the sample counts to obtain the net counts due to the radioactive sample.\n\n7. Calculate activity: Using the calibration factor and efficiency obtained during the calibration step, convert the net counts to the activity of the radioactive sample. The activity is usually expressed in units of Becquerel (Bq) or Curie (Ci), where 1 Bq = 1 disintegration per second and 1 Ci = 3.7 x 10^10 disintegrations per second.\n\n8. Analyze the results: Analyze the obtained activity value to determine the specific activity of the radioactive sample or to compare it with other samples or standards.\n\nKeep in mind that the accuracy and precision of the GM counter depend on factors such as the geometry of the setup, the distance between the sample and the detector, and the efficiency of the GM tube. It is essential to maintain consistent experimental conditions and perform multiple measurements to obtain reliable results."
