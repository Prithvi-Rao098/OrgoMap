    "message_1": "What is the bond dissociation energy of the H-Cl bond in HCl molecule, given that the bond length is 127 pm and the enthalpy change for the reaction HCl(g) → H(g) + Cl(g) is 431 kJ/mol?",
    "message_2": "The bond dissociation energy is the energy required to break a bond between two atoms. In this case, we are given the enthalpy change for the reaction HCl(g) → H(g) + Cl(g), which is the same as the bond dissociation energy for the H-Cl bond in the HCl molecule. Therefore, the bond dissociation energy of the H-Cl bond in the HCl molecule is 431 kJ/mol."
