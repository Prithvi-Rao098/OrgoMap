    "message_2": "To calculate the binding energy per nucleon for a helium-4 nucleus, we first need to determine the mass defect and then convert it to energy using Einstein's famous equation, E=mc^2. Finally, we will divide the binding energy by the number of nucleons (protons and neutrons) in the nucleus.\n\n1. Determine the mass defect:\nHelium-4 has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. The mass of a proton is approximately 1.007276 amu, and the mass of a neutron is approximately 1.008665 amu.\n\nMass of 2 protons = 2 x 1.007276 amu = 2.014552 amu\nMass of 2 neutrons = 2 x 1.008665 amu = 2.017330 amu\nTotal mass of individual nucleons = 2.014552 amu + 2.017330 amu = 4.031882 amu\n\nMass defect = Total mass of individual nucleons - Mass of helium-4 nucleus\nMass defect = 4.031882 amu - 4.001506 amu = 0.030376 amu\n\n2. Convert mass defect to energy:\n1 amu = 931.5 MeV/c^2 (Mega-electron volts per speed of light squared)\n\nEnergy = Mass defect x 931.5 MeV/c^2\nEnergy = 0.030376 amu x 931.5 MeV/c^2 = 28.295 MeV (Mega-electron volts)\n\n3. Calculate binding energy per nucleon:\nNumber of nucleons in helium-4 = 2 protons + 2 neutrons = 4\n\nBinding energy per nucleon = Total binding energy / Number of nucleons\nBinding energy per nucleon = 28.295 MeV / 4 = 7.074 MeV/nucleon\n\nSo, the binding energy per nucleon for a helium-4 nucleus is approximately 7.074 MeV/nucleon."
