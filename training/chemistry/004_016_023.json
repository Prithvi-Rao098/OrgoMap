    "message_2": "To determine the concentration of the unknown copper(II) ion solution using polarography, we need to use the Ilkovic equation:\n\ni = n * D^(2/3) * A^(1/2) * C * (v/RT)^(1/6)\n\nwhere:\ni = current (2.5 mA)\nn = number of electrons transferred in the redox reaction (2 for Cu2+ to Cu)\nD = diffusion coefficient of the electroactive species (we need to assume a value for this, let's say 7.2 x 10^-6 cm^2/s for Cu2+)\nA = area of the dropping mercury electrode (DME) (we need to assume a value for this, let's say 0.03 cm^2)\nC = concentration of the electroactive species (Cu2+)\nv = rate of mercury drop (we need to assume a value for this, let's say 0.002 cm/s)\nR = gas constant (8.314 J/mol*K)\nT = temperature (assuming room temperature, 298 K)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the current from mA to A:\n\ni = 2.5 mA = 0.0025 A\n\nNow we can rearrange the Ilkovic equation to solve for the concentration (C):\n\nC = i / (n * D^(2/3) * A^(1/2) * (v/RT)^(1/6))\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nC = 0.0025 / (2 * (7.2 x 10^-6)^(2/3) * (0.03)^(1/2) * (0.002/(8.314*298))^(1/6))\n\nC ≈ 0.0025 / (2 * 0.000144 * 0.1732 * 0.036)\n\nC ≈ 0.0025 / 0.000002\n\nC ≈ 1.25 M\n\nThe concentration of the unknown copper(II) ion solution is approximately 1.25 M. Note that the actual concentration may vary depending on the actual values of the diffusion coefficient, electrode area, and drop rate, which were assumed in this calculation."
