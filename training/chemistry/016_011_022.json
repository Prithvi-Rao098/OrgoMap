The initial temperature of the ethanol and water mixture is 25°C, and the final temperature of the mixture is 21°C. Assume that the density of the final solution is 1 g/mL and that the specific heat capacity of the final solution is the same as that of water. Use the following information for the enthalpy of fusion and the enthalpy of vaporization of water and ethanol, respectively: ∆Hfus(H2O) = 6.01 kJ/mol, ∆Hvap(H2O) = 40.7 kJ/mol, ∆Hfus(C2H5OH) = 5.02 kJ/mol, and ∆Hvap(C2H5OH) = 38.6 kJ/mol.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change when 50 grams of water is mixed with 75 grams of ethanol, we can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat transfer, m is the mass of the substance, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nSince the specific heat capacity of the final solution is assumed to be the same as that of water, we can use the specific heat capacity of water, which is 4.18 J/g°C.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the heat transfer for water:\nm_water = 50 g\nΔT_water = 21°C - 25°C = -4°C\n\nq_water = (50 g)(4.18 J/g°C)(-4°C) = -836 J\n\nNow, let's calculate the heat transfer for ethanol:\nm_ethanol = 75 g\nΔT_ethanol = 21°C - 25°C = -4°C\n\nq_ethanol = (75 g)(4.18 J/g°C)(-4°C) = -1254 J\n\nThe total heat transfer (enthalpy change) is the sum of the heat transfers for water and ethanol:\n\nq_total = q_water + q_ethanol = -836 J + (-1254 J) = -2090 J\n\nSo, the enthalpy change when 50 grams of water at 25°C is mixed with 75 grams of ethanol at 25°C is -2090 J."
