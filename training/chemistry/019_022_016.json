    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the formula:\n\nΔH_reaction = Σ ΔHf(products) - Σ ΔHf(reactants)\n\nFor the products, we have 6 moles of CO2 (g) and 6 moles of H2O (l):\nΣ ΔHf(products) = 6 × (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 6 × (-285.8 kJ/mol) = -2361 kJ/mol - 1714.8 kJ/mol = -4075.8 kJ/mol\n\nFor the reactants, we have 1 mole of C6H12O6 (s) and 6 moles of O2 (g). The standard enthalpy of formation for O2 (g) is 0 kJ/mol since it is in its elemental form:\nΣ ΔHf(reactants) = (-1273 kJ/mol) + 6 × 0 kJ/mol = -1273 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction:\nΔH_reaction = Σ ΔHf(products) - Σ ΔHf(reactants) = -4075.8 kJ/mol - (-1273 kJ/mol) = -2802.8 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the reaction is -2802.8 kJ/mol."
