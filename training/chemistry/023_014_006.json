    "message_2": "The preparation of 4-bromoacetanilide from acetanilide and bromine can be done through electrophilic aromatic substitution. Here is the step-by-step procedure:\n\n1. Chemicals and reagents needed:\n   - Acetanilide (starting material)\n   - Bromine (Br2, electrophilic reagent)\n   - Glacial acetic acid (solvent and catalyst)\n   - Sodium bisulfite (NaHSO3, for bromine removal)\n   - Distilled water (for purification)\n\n2. Reaction:\n   Acetanilide + Br2 → 4-bromoacetanilide + HBr\n\n3. Procedure:\n   a. In a round-bottom flask, dissolve an appropriate amount of acetanilide in glacial acetic acid. The acetic acid serves as both a solvent and a catalyst for the reaction.\n   b. Slowly add bromine to the flask while stirring the solution. The bromine will react with the acetanilide to form 4-bromoacetanilide. The reaction is exothermic, so it is essential to control the temperature and avoid overheating.\n   c. Continue stirring until the reaction is complete. You can monitor the progress of the reaction using thin-layer chromatography (TLC) or observing the disappearance of the red-brown color of bromine.\n   d. Once the reaction is complete, add sodium bisulfite to the reaction mixture to remove any excess bromine. The solution will turn colorless when all the bromine has reacted with the sodium bisulfite.\n   e. Pour the reaction mixture into a beaker containing crushed ice and distilled water. This will cause the 4-bromoacetanilide to precipitate out of the solution.\n   f. Filter the precipitate using vacuum filtration to collect the crude 4-bromoacetanilide product.\n   g. Recrystallize the crude product using a suitable solvent, such as ethanol or a mixture of ethanol and water, to obtain pure 4-bromoacetanilide crystals.\n   h. Filter the recrystallized product and allow it to dry.\n\n4. Characterization and purification:\n   - Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) can be used to monitor the progress of the reaction and the purity of the final product.\n   - Melting point determination can be used to assess the purity of the final product. The melting point of pure 4-bromoacetanilide is around 165-166°C.\n   - Infrared (IR) spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry can be used to confirm the structure and identity of the final product."
