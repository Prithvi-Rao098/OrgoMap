Assume the heat capacity of the solution to be 4.184 J/g°C and that there is no heat loss to the surroundings.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of solution, we first need to determine the heat (q) released or absorbed during the dissolution process. We can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere m is the mass of the solution, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nFirst, let's find the mass of the solution. We know that the mass of KCl is 10.0 g and the volume of water is 100 mL. Assuming the density of water is 1 g/mL, the mass of water is:\n\nmass of water = volume of water × density of water = 100 mL × 1 g/mL = 100 g\n\nNow, we can find the mass of the solution:\n\nmass of solution = mass of KCl + mass of water = 10.0 g + 100 g = 110 g\n\nNext, we can find the change in temperature:\n\nΔT = T_final - T_initial = 20°C - 25°C = -5°C\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat (q) using the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT = (110 g)(4.184 J/g°C)(-5°C) = -2296.2 J\n\nSince the temperature of the solution decreases, the dissolution process is exothermic, and the heat is released to the surroundings. Therefore, q = -2296.2 J.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the enthalpy of solution (ΔH_solution) per mole of KCl. First, we need to find the number of moles of KCl:\n\nMolar mass of KCl = 39.10 g/mol (K) + 35.45 g/mol (Cl) = 74.55 g/mol\n\nmoles of KCl = mass of KCl / molar mass of KCl = 10.0 g / 74.55 g/mol = 0.134 mol\n\nNow, we can find the enthalpy of solution per mole of KCl:\n\nΔH_solution = q / moles of KCl = -2296.2 J / 0.134 mol = -17135 J/mol\n\nThe enthalpy of solution for potassium chloride is approximately -17.1 kJ/mol."
