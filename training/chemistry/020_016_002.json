    "message_1": "What is the effect of increasing the concentration of sodium chloride solution on the solubility of a sparingly soluble salt like lead chloride? How does this change in solubility affect the equilibrium of the reaction? Calculate the new equilibrium concentration of lead ion and chloride ion when a solution of 0.1 M sodium chloride is added to a saturated solution of lead chloride.",
    "message_2": "Increasing the concentration of sodium chloride solution will decrease the solubility of a sparingly soluble salt like lead chloride due to the common ion effect. The common ion effect states that the solubility of a sparingly soluble salt is decreased when a soluble salt with a common ion is added to the solution.\n\nThe equilibrium of the reaction will be affected by the addition of sodium chloride, as it will shift the equilibrium towards the left (towards the solid lead chloride) according to Le Chatelier's principle. This is because the increased concentration of the common ion (chloride) will cause the reaction to adjust in a way that reduces the effect of the change, which in this case is by decreasing the solubility of lead chloride.\n\nTo calculate the new equilibrium concentration of lead ion and chloride ion, we first need to know the solubility product constant (Ksp) of lead chloride. The Ksp of lead chloride is 1.7 x 10^-5.\n\nThe reaction for the dissolution of lead chloride is:\nPbCl2 (s) <=> Pb2+ (aq) + 2Cl- (aq)\n\nLet x be the solubility of lead chloride in moles per liter. At equilibrium, the concentration of Pb2+ will be x, and the concentration of Cl- will be 2x + 0.1 (due to the addition of 0.1 M sodium chloride).\n\nNow we can set up the Ksp expression:\nKsp = [Pb2+][Cl-]^2\n1.7 x 10^-5 = (x)(2x + 0.1)^2\n\nSolving for x, we get:\nx ≈ 1.4 x 10^-5 M\n\nSo, the new equilibrium concentration of lead ion (Pb2+) is approximately 1.4 x 10^-5 M, and the new equilibrium concentration of chloride ion (Cl-) is approximately 2(1.4 x 10^-5) + 0.1 ≈ 0.10003 M."
