    "message_2": "When a piece of zinc is placed in a copper(II) sulfate solution, a single replacement reaction occurs. Zinc displaces copper from the copper(II) sulfate, forming zinc sulfate and copper. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nZn (s) + CuSO4 (aq) → ZnSO4 (aq) + Cu (s)\n\nTo calculate the mass of copper produced from 10 grams of copper(II) sulfate, we need to use stoichiometry. First, we need to find the molar mass of copper(II) sulfate (CuSO4):\n\nCu: 63.55 g/mol\nS: 32.07 g/mol\nO: 16.00 g/mol (x4)\n\nMolar mass of CuSO4 = 63.55 + 32.07 + (16.00 x 4) = 159.62 g/mol\n\nNow, we can convert the mass of copper(II) sulfate to moles:\n\n10 g CuSO4 × (1 mol CuSO4 / 159.62 g CuSO4) = 0.0627 mol CuSO4\n\nAccording to the balanced equation, 1 mole of CuSO4 produces 1 mole of Cu. Therefore, the moles of copper produced will be the same as the moles of copper(II) sulfate:\n\n0.0627 mol CuSO4 × (1 mol Cu / 1 mol CuSO4) = 0.0627 mol Cu\n\nNow, we can convert the moles of copper to grams using the molar mass of copper (63.55 g/mol):\n\n0.0627 mol Cu × (63.55 g Cu / 1 mol Cu) = 3.98 g Cu\n\nSo, 3.98 grams of copper would be produced from 10 grams of copper(II) sulfate and excess zinc."
