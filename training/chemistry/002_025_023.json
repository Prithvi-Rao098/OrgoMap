    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic moment of a tetrahedral nickel (II) complex with coordination number 4 and four cyanide ligands, we need to consider the electronic configuration of the nickel ion and the ligand field splitting.\n\nNickel (Ni) has an atomic number of 28, and its electronic configuration is [Ar] 3d^8 4s^2. In the nickel (II) complex, the nickel ion has lost two electrons, so its electronic configuration becomes [Ar] 3d^8.\n\nCyanide (CN-) is a strong field ligand, and it causes the d-orbitals to split into two groups: the lower energy t2g orbitals (dxy, dyz, and dxz) and the higher energy eg orbitals (dz^2 and dx^2-y^2). However, since the complex is tetrahedral, the splitting is not as large as in an octahedral complex.\n\nIn a tetrahedral complex, the d-orbitals are split into a lower energy e set (dxy, dx^2-y^2) and a higher energy t2 set (dyz, dxz, dz^2). The energy difference between these orbitals is denoted as Δ_tet.\n\nFor a tetrahedral Ni(II) complex, the 8 d-electrons will fill the orbitals as follows:\n\n1. e orbitals (lower energy): 2 electrons each in dxy and dx^2-y^2, total of 4 electrons.\n2. t2 orbitals (higher energy): 1 electron each in dyz, dxz, and dz^2, total of 3 electrons.\n\nSince there are 3 unpaired electrons in the t2 orbitals, we can calculate the magnetic moment (μ) using the spin-only formula:\n\nμ = √(n(n+2))\n\nwhere n is the number of unpaired electrons.\n\nμ = √(3(3+2))\nμ = √(3(5))\nμ = √15\n\nThe magnetic moment of the tetrahedral nickel (II) complex with four cyanide ligands is approximately √15 Bohr magnetons."
