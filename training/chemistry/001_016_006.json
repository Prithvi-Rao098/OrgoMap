    "message_2": "The reaction of tert-butyl alcohol (t-BuOH) with hydrochloric acid (HCl) to form tert-butyl chloride (t-BuCl) is an example of an acid-catalyzed substitution reaction (specifically, an SN1 reaction).\n\nThe mechanism involves the following steps:\n\n1. Protonation of the alcohol: The oxygen atom in the tert-butyl alcohol molecule is protonated by the hydrochloric acid, forming a protonated tert-butyl alcohol intermediate (t-BuOH2+). This step is reversible.\n\nt-BuOH + HCl ⇌ t-BuOH2+ + Cl-\n\n2. Formation of the carbocation: The protonated tert-butyl alcohol intermediate undergoes heterolysis, breaking the O-H bond and releasing a water molecule. This results in the formation of a tert-butyl carbocation intermediate (t-Bu+), which is a highly reactive species.\n\nt-BuOH2+ ⇌ t-Bu+ + H2O\n\n3. Nucleophilic attack: The chloride ion (Cl-) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbocation, forming the tert-butyl chloride product.\n\nt-Bu+ + Cl- → t-BuCl\n\nIn summary, the intermediates involved in this reaction are the protonated tert-butyl alcohol (t-BuOH2+) and the tert-butyl carbocation (t-Bu+). The mechanism is an SN1 reaction, which involves the formation of a carbocation intermediate and a nucleophilic attack by the chloride ion."
