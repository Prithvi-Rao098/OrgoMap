Given that the enthalpy change of formation of Fe2O3 and CO2 is -824 kJ/mol and -393 kJ/mol respectively, and ΔH° for the reaction of Fe2O3 with CO is -23 kJ/mol, what is the enthalpy change of reduction of Fe2O3?",
    "message_2": "To find the enthalpy change of reduction of Fe2O3, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH(reduction) = ΔH(products) - ΔH(reactants)\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nFe2O3 + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO2\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the reactants and products:\n\nΔH(reactants) = 1 * ΔH(Fe2O3) = 1 * (-824 kJ/mol) = -824 kJ\nΔH(products) = 3 * ΔH(CO2) = 3 * (-393 kJ/mol) = -1179 kJ\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔH(reduction) = -1179 kJ - (-824 kJ) = -355 kJ\n\nSo, the enthalpy change of reduction of Fe2O3 is -355 kJ."
