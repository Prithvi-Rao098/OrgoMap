    "message_2": "To find the rate of polymerization for the mixture, we need to consider the individual rates of polymerization for styrene and methyl methacrylate. Since it is a first-order reaction, the rate law for each monomer can be expressed as:\n\nRate = k [monomer]\n\nFor styrene:\nRate_styrene = k_styrene [styrene]\nRate_styrene = (0.12 L/mol/min)(2.5 mol/L)\n\nFor methyl methacrylate:\nRate_methyl_methacrylate = k_methyl_methacrylate [methyl methacrylate]\nRate_methyl_methacrylate = (0.08 L/mol/min)(0.5 mol/L)\n\nNow, we can find the total rate of polymerization by adding the individual rates:\n\nTotal rate = Rate_styrene + Rate_methyl_methacrylate\nTotal rate = (0.12 L/mol/min)(2.5 mol/L) + (0.08 L/mol/min)(0.5 mol/L)\n\nTotal rate = 0.3 L/min + 0.04 L/min\nTotal rate = 0.34 L/min\n\nThe rate of polymerization for the mixture is 0.34 L/min."
