    "message_1": "What is the equilibrium constant, Kc for the reaction: \n\n2 SO2(g) + O2(g) ⇌ 2 SO3(g) \n\nif the concentration of SO2 is 0.25 M, the concentration of O2 is 0.35 M and the concentration of SO3 is 0.20 M at equilibrium at a certain temperature and pressure?",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant Kc for the reaction, we need to use the expression for Kc, which is given by the ratio of the product of the concentrations of the products raised to their stoichiometric coefficients to the product of the concentrations of the reactants raised to their stoichiometric coefficients.\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\n2 SO2(g) + O2(g) ⇌ 2 SO3(g)\n\nThe Kc expression is:\n\nKc = [SO3]^2 / ([SO2]^2 * [O2])\n\nNow, we can plug in the given equilibrium concentrations:\n\nKc = ([0.20]^2) / (([0.25]^2) * [0.35])\n\nKc = (0.04) / (0.0625 * 0.35)\n\nKc = 0.04 / 0.021875\n\nKc ≈ 1.83\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant Kc for the reaction is approximately 1.83 at the given temperature and pressure."
