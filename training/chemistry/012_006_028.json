    "message_2": "The optimal ratio of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2) and graphene oxide (GO) in a composite material for high-performance dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) depends on the specific application and desired properties of the solar cell. However, research has shown that incorporating a certain amount of graphene oxide into the TiO2 matrix can improve the overall efficiency and stability of the solar cell.\n\nA study by Wang et al. (2012) found that a composite with a weight ratio of 1% GO to TiO2 (1:100) exhibited the highest power conversion efficiency of 7.48%, which was an improvement of 32.5% compared to a pure TiO2-based DSSC. The enhanced efficiency was attributed to the improved electron transport and reduced charge recombination in the presence of GO.\n\nAnother study by Roy-Mayhew et al. (2014) reported that incorporating 2 wt% of GO into the TiO2 matrix resulted in a 15% increase in power conversion efficiency compared to a pure TiO2-based DSSC. The improved efficiency was attributed to the increased surface area and improved charge transport properties of the composite material.\n\nIn terms of stability, incorporating GO into the TiO2 matrix can also improve the long-term stability of the solar cell. The presence of GO can help to prevent the aggregation of TiO2 nanoparticles, which can lead to a more stable and efficient solar cell over time.\n\nIn summary, the optimal ratio of TiO2 nanoparticles and graphene oxide in a composite material for high-performance dye-sensitized solar cells depends on the specific application and desired properties of the solar cell. However, research has shown that incorporating a small amount of GO (1-2 wt%) into the TiO2 matrix can improve the overall efficiency and stability of the solar cell. Further research and optimization may be required to determine the ideal ratio for a specific application."
