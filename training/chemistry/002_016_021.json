    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) and standard entropy change (ΔS°) for the reaction, we need to use the following formulas:\n\nΔH° = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants)\nΔS° = Σ ΔSf°(products) - Σ ΔSf°(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔHf° and ΔSf° are the standard enthalpies of formation and standard entropies of the substances involved in the reaction, respectively.\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\n2 H2(g) + O2(g) → 2 H2O(g)\n\nWe need to find the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) and standard entropies (ΔSf°) for the reactants and products. The values can be found in standard thermodynamic tables. Here are the values:\n\nΔHf° (H2) = 0 kJ/mol (since it is an element in its standard state)\nΔHf° (O2) = 0 kJ/mol (since it is an element in its standard state)\nΔHf° (H2O, g) = -241.8 kJ/mol\n\nΔSf° (H2) = 130.7 J/mol·K\nΔSf° (O2) = 205.2 J/mol·K\nΔSf° (H2O, g) = 188.8 J/mol·K\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°):\n\nΔH° = [2 × (-241.8)] - [2 × 0 + 1 × 0] = -483.6 kJ\n\nAnd the standard entropy change (ΔS°):\n\nΔS° = [2 × 188.8] - [2 × 130.7 + 1 × 205.2] = 377.6 - 466.6 = -89.0 J/mol·K\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the reaction is -483.6 kJ, and the standard entropy change (ΔS°) is -89.0 J/mol·K."
