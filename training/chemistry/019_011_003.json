    "message_2": "The given balanced chemical equation is:\n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) → 2NH3(g)  ∆H° = −92.4 kJ/mol\n\nTo calculate the standard enthalpy change (∆H°) for the formation of ammonia (NH3) at 298 K, we can use the given ∆H° value directly since it is already provided for the balanced equation.\n\n∆H° = -92.4 kJ/mol\n\nThis means that the standard enthalpy change for the formation of ammonia (NH3) at 298 K is -92.4 kJ/mol."
