    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the reaction of methane (CH₄) and oxygen (O₂) to form carbon dioxide (CO₂) and water vapor (H₂O), we need to use the following equation:\n\nΔH° = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔHf° is the standard enthalpy of formation for each compound.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nCH₄(g) + 2 O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2 H₂O(g)\n\nNow, we need the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) for each compound:\n\nΔHf°(CH₄) = -74.8 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(O₂) = 0 kJ/mol (since O₂ is in its elemental form)\nΔHf°(CO₂) = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(H₂O) = -241.8 kJ/mol (for water vapor)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔH° = [1 × (-393.5) + 2 × (-241.8)] - [1 × (-74.8) + 2 × 0]\n\nΔH° = (-393.5 - 483.6) - (-74.8)\n\nΔH° = -877.1 + 74.8\n\nΔH° = -802.3 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change for the reaction of methane gas and oxygen gas to form carbon dioxide gas and water vapor is -802.3 kJ/mol."
