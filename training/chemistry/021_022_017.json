    "message_2": "To calculate the expected pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid, we will use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which relates the pH, pKa, and the ratio of the concentrations of the conjugate base (A-) and the weak acid (HA) in the solution. The equation is as follows:\n\npH = pKa + log ([A-]/[HA])\n\nFirst, we need to determine the concentrations of the acetic acid (HA) and its conjugate base, the acetate ion (A-). Since acetic acid is a weak acid, it will only partially dissociate in water:\n\nCH3COOH (HA) ⇌ CH3COO- (A-) + H+\n\nInitially, we have 0.1 M of acetic acid and 0 M of acetate ion. Let x be the concentration of acetic acid that dissociates. At equilibrium, we will have (0.1 - x) M of acetic acid and x M of acetate ion.\n\nNow, we can write the expression for the acid dissociation constant (Ka) of acetic acid:\n\nKa = [CH3COO-][H+]/[CH3COOH] = [x][x]/[0.1 - x]\n\nGiven the pKa value of 4.76, we can calculate the Ka value:\n\nKa = 10^(-pKa) = 10^(-4.76) ≈ 1.74 x 10^(-5)\n\nNow, we can substitute the Ka value into the equation:\n\n1.74 x 10^(-5) = [x][x]/[0.1 - x]\n\nSince Ka is very small, we can assume that x is much smaller than 0.1, so we can simplify the equation:\n\n1.74 x 10^(-5) ≈ x^2/0.1\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx^2 ≈ 1.74 x 10^(-5) * 0.1\nx^2 ≈ 1.74 x 10^(-6)\nx ≈ 1.32 x 10^(-3)\n\nNow that we have the concentration of the acetate ion (A-) and the remaining concentration of acetic acid (HA), we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log ([A-]/[HA])\npH = 4.76 + log (1.32 x 10^(-3) / (0.1 - 1.32 x 10^(-3)))\npH ≈ 4.76 + log (1.32 x 10^(-3) / 0.1)\npH ≈ 4.76 - 1\npH ≈ 3.76\n\nTherefore, the expected pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid with a pKa value of 4.76 is approximately 3.76."
