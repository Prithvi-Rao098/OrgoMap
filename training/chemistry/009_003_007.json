    "message_1": "What is the energy released when one atom of uranium-235 undergoes complete fission?",
    "message_2": "The energy released when one atom of uranium-235 undergoes complete fission is approximately 200 MeV (million electron volts) or 3.2 x 10^-11 Joules. This value is an average, as the actual energy released can vary depending on the specific fission products produced during the reaction."
