    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of vaporization for water at 100 °C, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere:\nP1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively\nΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization\nR is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\n\nSince we are given the vapor pressure of water at 100 °C (373.15 K), we can set P1 = 101.325 kPa and T1 = 373.15 K. To find P2, we can use the fact that the vapor pressure of water at 0 °C (273.15 K) is approximately 0.6113 kPa. Therefore, we can set P2 = 0.6113 kPa and T2 = 273.15 K.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(101.325/0.6113) = -ΔHvap/8.314 * (1/273.15 - 1/373.15)\n\nSolving for ΔHvap:\n\nΔHvap = -8.314 * ln(101.325/0.6113) / (1/273.15 - 1/373.15)\nΔHvap ≈ 40,657 J/mol\n\nThe enthalpy of vaporization for water at 100 °C is approximately 40,657 J/mol."
