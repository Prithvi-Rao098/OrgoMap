    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change (ΔH) of the isomerization reaction, we can use the following formula:\n\nΔH = Σ(ΔHf products) - Σ(ΔHf reactants)\n\nIn this case, the reaction is:\n\nbut-2-ene → 2-methylpropene\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) of but-2-ene is -20.4 kJ/mol, and that of 2-methylpropene is -27.0 kJ/mol.\n\nUsing the formula, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nΔH = (-27.0 kJ/mol) - (-20.4 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH = -27.0 + 20.4\nΔH = -6.6 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change for the isomerization of but-2-ene to 2-methylpropene is -6.6 kJ/mol."
