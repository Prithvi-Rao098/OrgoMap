    "message_2": "To determine the concentration of copper ions in a sample solution of known volume using polarography, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Prepare the sample solution: Dilute the sample to a known volume, if necessary, and add supporting electrolyte (e.g., KNO3) to minimize the resistance of the solution.\n\n2. Set up the polarographic cell: The cell typically consists of a dropping mercury electrode (DME) as the working electrode, a reference electrode (e.g., Ag/AgCl), and an auxiliary electrode (e.g., platinum wire). Fill the cell with the sample solution.\n\n3. Perform the polarographic analysis: Apply a potential to the working electrode and measure the current response. The potential is scanned from a starting value to a more negative value, and the current is recorded as a function of the applied potential. The resulting plot is called a polarogram.\n\n4. Identify the copper peak: Copper ions will be reduced at the working electrode at a specific potential, resulting in a peak in the polarogram. The potential at which this peak occurs is characteristic of copper and can be found in the literature or determined experimentally using a standard solution of known copper concentration.\n\n5. Measure the peak current: The height of the copper peak in the polarogram is proportional to the concentration of copper ions in the sample solution. Measure the peak current (ip) corresponding to the copper reduction.\n\n6. Calibration: Prepare a series of standard solutions with known concentrations of copper ions and perform polarographic analysis on each. Plot the peak current (ip) as a function of copper concentration to obtain a calibration curve.\n\n7. Calculate the concentration of copper ions: Use the calibration curve to determine the concentration of copper ions in the sample solution based on the measured peak current (ip). If the sample was diluted in step 1, don't forget to account for the dilution factor when calculating the final concentration.\n\nBy following these steps, you can determine the concentration of copper ions in a sample solution using polarography."
