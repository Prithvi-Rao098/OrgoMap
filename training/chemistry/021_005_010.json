    "message_2": "The bond between hydrogen and oxygen in water is polar. Polarity in a bond arises due to the difference in electronegativity between the two atoms involved in the bond. Electronegativity is the ability of an atom to attract the shared electrons in a bond towards itself.\n\nIn the case of water (H2O), oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen. Oxygen has an electronegativity value of 3.44, while hydrogen has a value of 2.20. This difference in electronegativity causes the shared electrons to be more attracted to the oxygen atom, creating a partial negative charge (δ-) on the oxygen and a partial positive charge (δ+) on the hydrogen atoms.\n\nAs a result, the bond between hydrogen and oxygen in water is polar, with the oxygen atom being more negatively charged and the hydrogen atoms being more positively charged. This polarity contributes to water's unique properties, such as its high boiling point, high heat capacity, and ability to dissolve many substances."
