    "message_2": "When solid iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) reacts with carbon monoxide (CO) gas at high temperature in the presence of a catalyst, the products formed are iron (Fe) and carbon dioxide (CO2). The balanced equation for the reaction is:\n\nFe2O3 (s) + 3 CO (g) â†’ 2 Fe (s) + 3 CO2 (g)\n\nThe role of the catalyst in this process is to lower the activation energy required for the reaction to occur, thus increasing the rate of the reaction. The catalyst does not get consumed in the reaction and can be reused multiple times. In this specific reaction, the catalyst helps to facilitate the reduction of iron(III) oxide by carbon monoxide, allowing the reaction to proceed more efficiently at high temperatures."
