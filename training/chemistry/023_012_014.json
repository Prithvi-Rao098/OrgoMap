    "message_2": "To calculate the molar yield of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) from the reaction of 100 grams of toluene with excess nitric acid, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the molecular weight of toluene and TNT.\n2. Calculate the moles of toluene used.\n3. Determine the stoichiometry of the reaction.\n4. Calculate the moles of TNT produced.\n5. Calculate the molar yield of TNT.\n\nStep 1: Determine the molecular weight of toluene and TNT\nToluene (C7H8) has a molecular weight of:\n(7 * 12.01) + (8 * 1.01) = 84.14 g/mol\n\nTNT (C7H5N3O6) has a molecular weight of:\n(7 * 12.01) + (5 * 1.01) + (3 * 14.01) + (6 * 16.00) = 227.13 g/mol\n\nStep 2: Calculate the moles of toluene used\nmoles of toluene = mass of toluene / molecular weight of toluene\nmoles of toluene = 100 g / 84.14 g/mol = 1.188 moles\n\nStep 3: Determine the stoichiometry of the reaction\nThe balanced chemical equation for the nitration of toluene to TNT is:\n\nC7H8 + 3 HNO3 â†’ C7H5N3O6 + 3 H2O\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of toluene reacts with 3 moles of nitric acid to produce 1 mole of TNT.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the moles of TNT produced\nSince there is excess nitric acid, the reaction will be limited by the amount of toluene. Therefore, the moles of TNT produced will be equal to the moles of toluene used.\n\nmoles of TNT = 1.188 moles\n\nStep 5: Calculate the molar yield of TNT\nThe molar yield of TNT is the same as the moles of TNT produced, which is 1.188 moles."
