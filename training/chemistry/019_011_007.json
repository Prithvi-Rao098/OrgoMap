    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy change for the formation of CO2(g) from its elements at standard conditions, we need to consider the following reactions:\n\n1. Formation of CO(g) from its elements:\nC(s) + 1/2 O2(g) → CO(g)    ΔHf° = -110.53 kJ/mol\n\n2. Formation of CO2(g) from CO(g) and O2(g):\nCO(g) + 1/2 O2(g) → CO2(g)    ΔHf° = x kJ/mol (unknown)\n\n3. Formation of CO2(g) from its elements:\nC(s) + O2(g) → CO2(g)    ΔHf° = y kJ/mol (unknown)\n\nWe can use Hess's Law to solve for the unknown enthalpy changes. Hess's Law states that the enthalpy change of a reaction is the same, whether it occurs in one step or several steps. In this case, we can add reactions 1 and 2 to get reaction 3:\n\nC(s) + 1/2 O2(g) → CO(g)    ΔHf° = -110.53 kJ/mol\nCO(g) + 1/2 O2(g) → CO2(g)    ΔHf° = x kJ/mol\n----------------------------------------------\nC(s) + O2(g) → CO2(g)    ΔHf° = y kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can add the enthalpy changes for reactions 1 and 2 to find the enthalpy change for reaction 3:\n\n-110.53 kJ/mol + x kJ/mol = y kJ/mol\n\nWe know that the standard enthalpy change for the formation of CO2(g) from its elements is -393.5 kJ/mol. Therefore, we can set y equal to -393.5 kJ/mol and solve for x:\n\n-110.53 kJ/mol + x kJ/mol = -393.5 kJ/mol\n\nx = -393.5 kJ/mol + 110.53 kJ/mol\nx = -282.97 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change for the formation of CO2(g) from CO(g) and O2(g) is -282.97 kJ/mol."
