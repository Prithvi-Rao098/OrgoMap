    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction, we need to use the equilibrium constant expression. For the given reaction:\n\n2NH₃ (g) + 3O₂ (g) ⇌ 2NO (g) + 3H₂O (g)\n\nThe equilibrium constant expression (Kc) is given by:\n\nKc = [NO]^2 [H₂O]^3 / ([NH₃]^2 [O₂]^3)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given equilibrium concentrations:\n\nKc = ([0.18]^2 [0.39]^3) / ([0.50]^2 [0.25]^3)\n\nKc = (0.0324 * 0.059319) / (0.25 * 0.015625)\n\nKc = 0.00192156 / 0.00390625\n\nKc ≈ 0.492\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction is approximately 0.492."
