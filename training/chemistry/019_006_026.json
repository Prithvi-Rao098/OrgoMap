The reaction is written as follows: \n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) â‡Œ 2NH3(g) \n\nGiven the equilibrium concentrations are [N2] = 0.10 M, [H2] = 0.20 M, and [NH3] = 1.0 M.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction, we can use the formula:\n\nKc = [NH3]^2 / ([N2] * [H2]^3)\n\nGiven the equilibrium concentrations are [N2] = 0.10 M, [H2] = 0.20 M, and [NH3] = 1.0 M.\n\nNow, we can plug the given concentrations into the formula:\n\nKc = (1.0)^2 / (0.10 * (0.20)^3)\n\nKc = 1 / (0.10 * 0.008)\n\nKc = 1 / 0.0008\n\nKc = 1250\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction between nitrogen gas (N2) and hydrogen gas (H2) to form ammonia gas (NH3) at a temperature of 400 K is 1250."
