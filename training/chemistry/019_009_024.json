    "message_2": "To calculate the standard free energy change (∆G°) for the redox reaction, we need to use the Nernst equation:\n\n∆G° = -nFE°\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of electrons transferred, F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol), and E° is the standard cell potential.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the half-reactions for the redox reaction:\n\nOxidation half-reaction (H₂ is oxidized to H⁺):\nH₂(g) → 2 H⁺(aq) + 2 e⁻\nSince there are 3 moles of H₂, multiply the half-reaction by 3:\n3 H₂(g) → 6 H⁺(aq) + 6 e⁻\n\nReduction half-reaction (Fe³⁺ is reduced to Fe):\nFe³⁺(aq) + 3 e⁻ → Fe(s)\nSince there are 2 moles of Fe³⁺, multiply the half-reaction by 2:\n2 Fe³⁺(aq) + 6 e⁻ → 2 Fe(s)\n\nNow, we need to find the standard reduction potentials (E°) for each half-reaction. These values can be found in a standard reduction potential table:\n\nE°(H₂/H⁺) = 0.00 V (by definition)\nE°(Fe³⁺/Fe) = -0.036 V\n\nNext, we need to calculate the standard cell potential (E°) for the overall redox reaction:\n\nE°(cell) = E°(cathode) - E°(anode)\nE°(cell) = E°(Fe³⁺/Fe) - E°(H₂/H⁺)\nE°(cell) = -0.036 V - 0.00 V\nE°(cell) = -0.036 V\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard free energy change (∆G°) using the Nernst equation:\n\n∆G° = -nFE°\n∆G° = -6 mol e⁻ * 96,485 C/mol e⁻ * (-0.036 V)\n∆G° = 20,923.56 J/mol\n\nSince the standard free energy change is usually expressed in kJ/mol, we can convert the value:\n\n∆G° = 20.92 kJ/mol"
