    "message_2": "Potentiometry is a technique used to measure the potential (voltage) of an electrochemical cell to determine the concentration of a specific ion in a solution. In this case, we want to determine the concentration of chloride ions (Cl-) in a 0.10 M solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl).\n\nHowever, in this particular case, potentiometry is not necessary to determine the concentration of chloride ions. This is because hydrochloric acid is a strong acid that completely dissociates in water, meaning that for every one mole of HCl, one mole of H+ and one mole of Cl- are produced.\n\nSo, in a 0.10 M solution of HCl, the concentration of chloride ions (Cl-) will also be 0.10 M."
