    "message_2": "The Gabriel synthesis is a method for synthesizing primary amines from primary alkyl halides using phthalimide as the nitrogen source. The reaction mechanism involves the following steps:\n\n1. Formation of phthalimide anion:\nPhthalimide is treated with a strong base, such as potassium hydroxide (KOH) or sodium hydride (NaH), which deprotonates the acidic NH proton of phthalimide, generating a phthalimide anion.\n\nPhthalimide + Base → Phthalimide anion + Conjugate acid of the base\n\n2. Nucleophilic substitution:\nThe phthalimide anion, acting as a nucleophile, attacks the primary alkyl halide in a nucleophilic substitution reaction (usually SN2 mechanism). This results in the formation of an N-alkyl phthalimide.\n\nPhthalimide anion + Primary alkyl halide → N-alkyl phthalimide + Halide ion\n\n3. Hydrolysis:\nThe N-alkyl phthalimide is then hydrolyzed, typically using aqueous hydrochloric acid (HCl) and heat. This step cleaves the N-alkyl group from the phthalimide, yielding the primary amine and phthalic acid.\n\nN-alkyl phthalimide + HCl + H2O → Primary amine + Phthalic acid\n\nOverall, the Gabriel synthesis allows for the preparation of primary amines without the formation of secondary or tertiary amine byproducts, which can be a problem in other amine synthesis methods."
