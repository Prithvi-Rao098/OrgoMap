    "message_2": "To calculate the rate of the electrochemical reaction, we first need to determine the number of moles of copper formed at the cathode. \n\n1. Calculate the moles of copper formed:\nmoles of copper = mass of copper / atomic weight of copper\nmoles of copper = 4 g / 63.5 g/mol\nmoles of copper = 0.0631 mol\n\n2. Calculate the total charge passed through the solution:\nCurrent (I) = 2.5 A\nTime (t) = 2 hours = 2 * 60 * 60 seconds = 7200 seconds\n\nTotal charge (Q) = Current (I) x Time (t)\nQ = 2.5 A * 7200 s\nQ = 18000 Coulombs\n\n3. Calculate the number of Faradays (F) passed through the solution:\n1 Faraday (F) = 96485 Coulombs/mol\n\nNumber of Faradays = Total charge (Q) / Faraday constant\nNumber of Faradays = 18000 C / 96485 C/mol\nNumber of Faradays = 0.1865 mol\n\n4. Calculate the number of electrons (n) involved in the reaction:\nCopper ions (Cu²⁺) gain 2 electrons to form copper atoms (Cu).\n\nCu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu\n\nSo, n = 2.\n\n5. Calculate the rate of the electrochemical reaction:\nRate of reaction = moles of copper / (number of Faradays * number of electrons)\n\nRate of reaction = 0.0631 mol / (0.1865 mol * 2)\nRate of reaction = 0.0631 mol / 0.373 mol\nRate of reaction = 0.169\n\nThe rate of the electrochemical reaction is 0.169 mol of copper per mole of electrons passed through the solution."
