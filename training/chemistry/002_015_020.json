    "message_2": "To predict the reactivity order of the given compounds (MgCl2, KCl, CaCl2, and NaCl), we need to consider the periodic trends in reactivity for metals and non-metals. In this case, all the compounds are ionic, formed by the reaction of a metal with a non-metal (chlorine).\n\n1. Reactivity of metals: As we move down a group in the periodic table, the reactivity of metals increases. This is because the atomic size increases, and the outermost electron is further away from the nucleus, making it easier to lose the electron and form a positive ion.\n\n2. Reactivity of non-metals: In this case, all the compounds have the same non-metal (chlorine), so the reactivity of non-metals does not play a role in determining the reactivity order.\n\nConsidering the reactivity of metals, we can predict the reactivity order as follows:\n\nKCl > CaCl2 > MgCl2 > NaCl\n\nJustification:\n\n- KCl: Potassium (K) is in Group 1 and Period 4 of the periodic table. It has a larger atomic size compared to the other metals in the list, making it more reactive.\n- CaCl2: Calcium (Ca) is in Group 2 and Period 4. It is less reactive than potassium due to its position in Group 2, but more reactive than magnesium and sodium due to its larger atomic size.\n- MgCl2: Magnesium (Mg) is in Group 2 and Period 3. It is less reactive than calcium due to its smaller atomic size, but more reactive than sodium because it is in Group 2.\n- NaCl: Sodium (Na) is in Group 1 and Period 3. It has the smallest atomic size among the metals in the list, making it the least reactive.\n\nIn conclusion, the reactivity order of the given compounds based on their electronic configuration is KCl > CaCl2 > MgCl2 > NaCl."
