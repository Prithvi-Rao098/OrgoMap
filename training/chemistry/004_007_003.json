    "message_1": "What is the mass of barium sulfate formed when a 5.00 g sample of a solution containing barium chloride is mixed with excess sodium sulfate and the resulting precipitate is filtered, dried, and weighed?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use stoichiometry. First, we need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between barium chloride and sodium sulfate:\n\nBaCl2 (aq) + Na2SO4 (aq) → BaSO4 (s) + 2NaCl (aq)\n\nNow, we need to find the number of moles of barium chloride in the 5.00 g sample. To do this, we need the molar mass of barium chloride (BaCl2):\n\nMolar mass of BaCl2 = (137.33 g/mol for Ba) + (2 × 35.45 g/mol for Cl) = 137.33 + 70.90 = 208.23 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the moles of BaCl2:\n\nmoles of BaCl2 = mass / molar mass = 5.00 g / 208.23 g/mol = 0.0240 mol\n\nFrom the balanced chemical equation, we can see that 1 mole of BaCl2 reacts with 1 mole of Na2SO4 to produce 1 mole of BaSO4. Since we have excess sodium sulfate, all of the barium chloride will react, and the moles of barium sulfate formed will be equal to the moles of barium chloride:\n\nmoles of BaSO4 = 0.0240 mol\n\nNow, we need to find the mass of barium sulfate (BaSO4) formed. First, we need the molar mass of BaSO4:\n\nMolar mass of BaSO4 = (137.33 g/mol for Ba) + (32.07 g/mol for S) + (4 × 16.00 g/mol for O) = 137.33 + 32.07 + 64.00 = 233.40 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the mass of BaSO4:\n\nmass of BaSO4 = moles × molar mass = 0.0240 mol × 233.40 g/mol = 5.60 g\n\nSo, the mass of barium sulfate formed when the 5.00 g sample of barium chloride is mixed with excess sodium sulfate is 5.60 g."
