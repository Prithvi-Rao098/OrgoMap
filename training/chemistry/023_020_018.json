    "message_2": "To determine the amount of chlorine gas needed to prepare 10 grams of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid from benzoic acid, we need to first write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction and then use stoichiometry to find the required amount of chlorine gas.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the synthesis of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid (C7H4Cl2O2) from benzoic acid (C7H6O2) is:\n\nC7H6O2 + 2 Cl2 → C7H4Cl2O2 + 2 HCl\n\nNow, we will use stoichiometry to determine the amount of chlorine gas needed.\n\n1. Calculate the molar mass of benzoic acid (C7H6O2) and 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid (C7H4Cl2O2):\n\nMolar mass of benzoic acid = (7 × 12.01) + (6 × 1.01) + (2 × 16.00) = 122.12 g/mol\nMolar mass of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid = (7 × 12.01) + (4 × 1.01) + (2 × 35.45) + (2 × 16.00) = 191.02 g/mol\n\n2. Calculate the moles of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid needed:\n\nmoles = mass / molar mass\nmoles of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid = 10 g / 191.02 g/mol = 0.0523 mol\n\n3. Use the stoichiometry of the balanced equation to find the moles of chlorine gas needed:\n\n1 mol of benzoic acid reacts with 2 mol of Cl2 to produce 1 mol of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid.\n\n0.0523 mol of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid requires 0.0523 × 2 = 0.1046 mol of Cl2.\n\n4. Calculate the mass of chlorine gas needed:\n\nmass = moles × molar mass\nmass of Cl2 = 0.1046 mol × (2 × 35.45 g/mol) = 0.1046 mol × 70.90 g/mol = 7.42 g\n\nTherefore, 7.42 grams of chlorine gas are needed to prepare 10 grams of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid from benzoic acid through the process of chemical synthesis."
