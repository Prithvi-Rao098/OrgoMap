    "message_2": "To determine the required amount of aniline and chlorine gas needed to synthesize 10 g of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline with a 90% yield, we first need to find the balanced chemical equation for the reaction and the molecular weights of the reactants and product.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nC6H7N + Cl2 + HNO3 â†’ C6H6ClN2O2 + H2O\n\nThe molecular weights of the reactants and product are:\n\nAniline (C6H7N): 93.13 g/mol\nChlorine gas (Cl2): 70.90 g/mol\nNitric acid (HNO3): 63.01 g/mol\n2-chloro-4-nitroaniline (C6H6ClN2O2): 173.58 g/mol\n\nSince we want to synthesize 10 g of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline with a 90% yield, we need to find the actual amount of product we need to produce:\n\nActual amount of product = Desired amount / % yield\nActual amount of product = 10 g / 0.90\nActual amount of product = 11.11 g\n\nNow, we can use stoichiometry to find the required amount of aniline and chlorine gas:\n\nMoles of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline = 11.11 g / 173.58 g/mol = 0.064 mol\n\nSince the balanced chemical equation shows a 1:1:1 ratio between aniline, chlorine gas, and 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline, we also need 0.064 mol of aniline and chlorine gas.\n\nMass of aniline = moles of aniline * molecular weight of aniline\nMass of aniline = 0.064 mol * 93.13 g/mol = 5.96 g\n\nMass of chlorine gas = moles of chlorine gas * molecular weight of chlorine gas\nMass of chlorine gas = 0.064 mol * 70.90 g/mol = 4.54 g\n\nTherefore, to synthesize 10 g of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline with a 90% yield, we need 5.96 g of aniline and 4.54 g of chlorine gas."
