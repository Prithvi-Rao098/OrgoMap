    "message_2": "To find the enthalpy change for the reduction of 2 moles of FeO to Fe, we can use Hess's Law, which states that the enthalpy change of a reaction is the same whether it occurs in one step or several steps. We can manipulate the given reactions to create a new reaction that represents the reduction of FeO to Fe.\n\nFirst, let's write down the given reactions:\n\n1) 2 Fe2O3(s) + 3 C(s) → 4 Fe(s) + 3 CO2(g)  ΔH1 = -183.3 kJ/mol\n2) Fe2O3(s) + 3 CO(g) → 2 Fe(s) + 3 CO2(g)  ΔH2 = -25.8 kJ/mol\n\nWe want to find the enthalpy change for the following reaction:\n\n3) 2 FeO(s) → 2 Fe(s) + O2(g)  ΔH3 = ?\n\nTo obtain reaction 3, we can manipulate reactions 1 and 2 as follows:\n\nFirst, divide reaction 1 by 2:\n\n1/2) Fe2O3(s) + 3/2 C(s) → 2 Fe(s) + 3/2 CO2(g)  ΔH1/2 = -91.65 kJ/mol\n\nNow, add reaction 2 and the modified reaction 1/2:\n\n2) Fe2O3(s) + 3 CO(g) → 2 Fe(s) + 3 CO2(g)  ΔH2 = -25.8 kJ/mol\n1/2) Fe2O3(s) + 3/2 C(s) → 2 Fe(s) + 3/2 CO2(g)  ΔH1/2 = -91.65 kJ/mol\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n4) 2 FeO(s) + 3 CO(g) + 3/2 C(s) → 4 Fe(s) + 3 CO2(g) + 3/2 CO2(g)  ΔH3 + ΔH2 = -117.45 kJ/mol\n\nNow, subtract 3 CO2(g) from both sides of the reaction:\n\n4) 2 FeO(s) + 3 CO(g) + 3/2 C(s) → 4 Fe(s) + 3/2 CO2(g)  ΔH3 = -117.45 kJ/mol\n\nFinally, we have the desired reaction:\n\n3) 2 FeO(s) → 2 Fe(s) + O2(g)  ΔH3 = -117.45 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the enthalpy change for the reduction of 2 moles of FeO to Fe is -117.45 kJ/mol."
