    "message_2": "To synthesize ibuprofen from methylcyclohexane, we can follow these retrosynthetic steps:\n\n1. Convert the carboxylic acid group of ibuprofen to an aldehyde.\n2. Disconnect the benzene ring from the aliphatic chain.\n3. Convert the benzene ring to a cyclohexane ring.\n\nHere is the forward synthesis pathway:\n\n1. Oxidation of methylcyclohexane to cyclohexanone:\n   Reagents: KMnO4, H2O, H2SO4 (dilute)\n   Conditions: Reflux, 1-2 hours\n\n2. Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of cyclohexanone to ε-caprolactone:\n   Reagents: mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid) or H2O2, trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)\n   Conditions: Room temperature, 1-2 hours\n\n3. Hydrolysis of ε-caprolactone to 6-hydroxyhexanoic acid:\n   Reagents: H2O, H2SO4 (dilute)\n   Conditions: Reflux, 1-2 hours\n\n4. Oxidation of 6-hydroxyhexanoic acid to adipic acid:\n   Reagents: KMnO4, H2O, H2SO4 (dilute)\n   Conditions: Reflux, 1-2 hours\n\n5. Wittig reaction of adipic acid with benzyltriphenylphosphonium chloride to form the alkene:\n   Reagents: (a) PPh3, benzyl bromide, K2CO3, DMF (to form benzyltriphenylphosphonium bromide)\n             (b) n-BuLi, THF (to form the phosphonium ylide)\n             (c) Adipic acid, THF\n   Conditions: (a) Room temperature, 1-2 hours\n               (b) -78°C, 1 hour\n               (c) -78°C to room temperature, 1-2 hours\n\n6. Hydrogenation of the alkene to form ibuprofen:\n   Reagents: H2, Pd/C\n   Conditions: Room temperature, 1-2 hours\n\nThis synthesis pathway involves six steps, starting from methylcyclohexane and using various reagents and conditions to achieve the desired product, ibuprofen."
