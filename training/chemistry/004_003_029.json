Use mass spectrometry to identify the unknown compound.",
    "message_2": "To identify the unknown compound using mass spectrometry, we need to analyze the given information and try to deduce the possible chemical formula and structure.\n\n1. Molecular ion peak (M+) at m/z 146: This indicates that the molecular weight of the compound is 146.\n\n2. Major fragment peaks at m/z 120 and 105: These peaks suggest that the compound can lose fragments with masses of 26 and 41, respectively, during the fragmentation process.\n\n3. The molecular ion peak is four times more intense than the base peak: This suggests that the molecular ion is relatively stable and does not undergo extensive fragmentation.\n\nNow, let's try to deduce the possible chemical formula of the compound:\n\nA molecular weight of 146 can be achieved with a combination of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and/or nitrogen atoms. A common approach is to calculate the double bond equivalent (DBE) or the degree of unsaturation.\n\nDBE = (2C + 2 + N - H) / 2\n\nSince we don't know the exact number of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen atoms, we can't calculate the DBE directly. However, we can make some educated guesses based on common organic compounds.\n\nOne possibility is that the compound contains a benzene ring, which has a molecular weight of 78 and a DBE of 4. This would leave us with a remaining mass of 68 (146 - 78) to account for.\n\nA common fragment that can be lost from a benzene ring is an ethyl group (C2H5) with a mass of 29. However, this doesn't match the given fragment masses of 26 and 41. Another possibility is the loss of a CN group (mass 26) and a C3H5 group (mass 41).\n\nTaking these fragments into consideration, we can propose a possible chemical formula for the unknown compound:\n\nC6H5 (benzene ring) + CN (26) + C3H5 (41) = C10H10N (146)\n\nThe unknown compound could be a derivative of aniline (C6H5NH2) with a propyl group (C3H7) attached to the nitrogen atom, forming N-propylaniline (C10H10N).\n\nPlease note that this is just one possible solution, and further analysis (such as NMR, IR, or elemental analysis) would be needed to confirm the identity of the unknown compound."
