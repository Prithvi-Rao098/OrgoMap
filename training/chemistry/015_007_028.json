    "message_2": "The size and shape of a molecule can significantly affect its electronic excited states and optical properties. This is because the spatial arrangement of atoms and the distribution of electrons within a molecule can influence the energy levels and transitions between these levels, which in turn determine the molecule's absorption and emission spectra.\n\nTo illustrate this, let's consider two molecules with similar chemical composition but different shapes: linear molecule A and bent molecule B. Both molecules have the same number of atoms and the same types of bonds, but their geometries are different.\n\nUsing quantum chemistry calculations, we can determine the electronic excited states and optical properties of these two molecules. For this purpose, we can use computational methods such as time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) or configuration interaction singles (CIS) to calculate the excitation energies and transition dipole moments.\n\n1. Electronic excited states: The electronic excited states of a molecule are determined by the distribution of electrons in its molecular orbitals. In our example, the different geometries of molecules A and B will lead to different molecular orbital energies and distributions. As a result, the excitation energies (the energy required to promote an electron from a lower-energy orbital to a higher-energy orbital) will also be different for the two molecules.\n\n2. Optical properties: The optical properties of a molecule, such as its absorption and emission spectra, are determined by the transition dipole moments between the ground state and the excited states. These transition dipole moments depend on the spatial distribution of the molecular orbitals involved in the transition. In our example, the different geometries of molecules A and B will lead to different spatial distributions of their molecular orbitals, resulting in different transition dipole moments and, consequently, different absorption and emission spectra.\n\nIn conclusion, the size and shape of a molecule can have a significant impact on its electronic excited states and optical properties. By comparing the electronic excited states and optical properties of two molecules with similar chemical composition but different shapes using quantum chemistry calculations, we can gain a better understanding of how molecular geometry influences these properties. This knowledge can be valuable in the design of new materials with specific optical properties for various applications, such as solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and sensors."
