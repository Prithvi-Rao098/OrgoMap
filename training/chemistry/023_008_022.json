    "message_2": "The preparation of p-nitroaniline from aniline and nitric acid involves an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. Here's the step-by-step mechanism:\n\n1. Protonation of nitric acid: Nitric acid (HNO3) reacts with a strong acid, usually sulfuric acid (H2SO4), to form the nitronium ion (NO2+), which is a strong electrophile. This reaction is facilitated by the protonation of nitric acid by sulfuric acid.\n\nHNO3 + H2SO4 → NO2+ + H3O+ + HSO4-\n\n2. Formation of the sigma complex: The electrophile, nitronium ion (NO2+), attacks the aniline molecule at the para-position (due to the activating effect of the amino group) on the aromatic ring. This leads to the formation of a sigma complex, which is a resonance-stabilized carbocation intermediate.\n\nAniline + NO2+ → Sigma complex (p-nitroaniline carbocation)\n\n3. Deprotonation: The sigma complex loses a proton (H+) to restore the aromaticity of the ring. This step is facilitated by the conjugate base of the strong acid used in the first step (HSO4- in this case).\n\nSigma complex → p-Nitroaniline + HSO4-\n\nThe final product is p-nitroaniline. It is important to note that aniline is usually acetylated before the nitration process to protect the amino group from further reactions. After the nitration, the acetyl group is removed by hydrolysis to obtain the p-nitroaniline."
