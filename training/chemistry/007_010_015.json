    "message_2": "The toxicity of existing drugs can vary significantly with changes in the functional groups present in the drug molecule. Functional groups are specific groups of atoms within a molecule that are responsible for the characteristic chemical reactions of that molecule. They play a crucial role in determining the properties, reactivity, and biological activity of a compound.\n\nWhen functional groups in a drug molecule are modified, it can lead to changes in the drug's pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and toxicity. Here are some ways in which the toxicity can be affected:\n\n1. Altering lipophilicity: Changing functional groups can modify the lipophilicity (fat solubility) of a drug, which in turn affects its absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. A more lipophilic drug may cross cell membranes more easily, potentially leading to increased toxicity.\n\n2. Changing metabolic pathways: The presence or absence of specific functional groups can influence how a drug is metabolized in the body. Some metabolic pathways may produce toxic metabolites, while others may not. By modifying functional groups, the drug's metabolic pathway can be altered, potentially increasing or decreasing its toxicity.\n\n3. Modifying receptor binding: Functional groups can play a crucial role in the binding of a drug to its target receptor. Changes in these groups can affect the drug's affinity for the receptor, leading to altered efficacy and potentially increased or decreased toxicity.\n\n4. Affecting protein binding: Many drugs bind to proteins in the blood, which can affect their distribution and elimination. Changing functional groups can alter a drug's protein binding properties, potentially leading to changes in toxicity.\n\n5. Forming reactive intermediates: Some functional groups can be metabolized to form reactive intermediates, which can bind to cellular macromolecules and cause toxicity. By modifying these functional groups, the formation of reactive intermediates can be influenced, potentially affecting the drug's toxicity.\n\nIn summary, changes in the functional groups present in a drug molecule can significantly impact its toxicity. These changes can affect various aspects of the drug's behavior in the body, including its absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, receptor binding, and protein binding. Understanding the relationship between functional groups and toxicity is essential for the rational design of new drugs with improved safety profiles."
