    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat energy required for this process, we first need to determine the number of moles of ethanol in the 55.0 g sample. The molecular weight of ethanol (C2H5OH) is:\n\n(2 * 12.01 g/mol for C) + (6 * 1.01 g/mol for H) + (1 * 16.00 g/mol for O) = 46.07 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the number of moles of ethanol:\n\n55.0 g / 46.07 g/mol = 1.194 moles of ethanol\n\nNext, we can use the enthalpy of vaporization to calculate the heat energy required:\n\nHeat energy = (moles of ethanol) * (enthalpy of vaporization)\nHeat energy = (1.194 moles) * (38.56 kJ/mol) = 46.03 kJ\n\nTherefore, the amount of heat energy required to vaporize the 55.0 g sample of ethanol at its normal boiling point is 46.03 kJ."
