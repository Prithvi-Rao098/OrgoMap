    "message_2": "To increase the availability and accessibility of chemistry-related extracurricular activities for students, schools and universities can take the following steps:\n\n1. Establish chemistry clubs: Create a chemistry club or society where students can participate in various chemistry-related activities, such as experiments, discussions, and workshops. This will provide a platform for students to explore their interests in chemistry and connect with like-minded peers.\n\n2. Organize workshops and seminars: Invite guest speakers from the chemistry field, such as researchers, professors, and industry professionals, to conduct workshops and seminars on various chemistry topics. This will expose students to the latest developments in the field and help them understand the real-world applications of chemistry.\n\n3. Collaborate with local organizations: Partner with local organizations, such as science centers, museums, and research institutions, to organize chemistry-related events and activities. This will provide students with opportunities to engage with professionals in the field and gain hands-on experience.\n\n4. Provide resources and support: Ensure that students have access to necessary resources, such as laboratory equipment, chemicals, and safety gear, to conduct experiments and participate in chemistry-related activities. Additionally, provide guidance and support from faculty members or experienced students to help students with their projects and experiments.\n\n5. Participate in competitions: Encourage students to participate in chemistry-related competitions, such as science fairs, Olympiads, and quiz bowls. This will not only help students showcase their skills and knowledge but also motivate them to learn more about the subject.\n\n6. Offer research opportunities: Provide students with opportunities to participate in research projects led by faculty members or collaborate with local research institutions. This will give students a chance to gain hands-on experience in the field and develop their research skills.\n\n7. Promote online resources: Share information about online resources, such as chemistry-related websites, forums, and educational platforms, where students can learn more about the subject and engage with the global chemistry community.\n\n8. Create mentorship programs: Pair interested students with mentors from the chemistry field, such as faculty members, researchers, or industry professionals, who can provide guidance and support in their pursuit of a chemistry career.\n\n9. Offer scholarships and financial support: Provide scholarships or financial assistance to students who wish to participate in chemistry-related extracurricular activities, such as attending conferences, workshops, or competitions, but may not have the means to do so.\n\n10. Raise awareness: Promote the importance of chemistry and the various career opportunities available in the field through informational sessions, posters, and social media campaigns. This will help students understand the value of pursuing a career in chemistry and encourage them to participate in extracurricular activities related to the subject."
