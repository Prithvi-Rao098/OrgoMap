    "message_2": "To determine the mass percent of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in the 5.00 g sample of limestone, we will first need to find the molar mass of CaCO3. \n\nThe molar mass of calcium (Ca) is 40.08 g/mol, carbon (C) is 12.01 g/mol, and oxygen (O) is 16.00 g/mol. \n\nThe molar mass of CaCO3 is:\n1 Ca x 40.08 g/mol + 1 C x 12.01 g/mol + 3 O x 16.00 g/mol = 40.08 + 12.01 + 48.00 = 100.09 g/mol\n\nSince we are assuming that the entire 5.00 g sample of limestone is composed of calcium carbonate, we can now calculate the mass percent of CaCO3 in the sample.\n\nMass percent of CaCO3 = (mass of CaCO3 / total mass of sample) x 100\n\nIn this case, the mass of CaCO3 is equal to the total mass of the sample, which is 5.00 g.\n\nMass percent of CaCO3 = (5.00 g / 5.00 g) x 100 = 100%\n\nTherefore, the mass percent of calcium carbonate in the 5.00 g sample of limestone is 100%."
