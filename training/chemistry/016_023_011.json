Delta H for the reaction is -190 kJ/mol. The enthalpy of formation for sucrose is -2227 kJ/mol, the enthalpy of formation for glucose is -1274 kJ/mol, and the enthalpy of formation for fructose is -1266 kJ/mol.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of sucrose, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH_reaction = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH_reaction is the enthalpy change for the reaction, ΔH_f(products) is the sum of the enthalpies of formation of the products, and ΔH_f(reactants) is the sum of the enthalpies of formation of the reactants.\n\nFor this reaction, the reactants are sucrose and water, and the products are glucose and fructose. The enthalpy of formation for water is not given, but since it is a reactant and not a product, it will not affect the final result.\n\nΔH_reaction = [ΔH_f(glucose) + ΔH_f(fructose)] - [ΔH_f(sucrose) + ΔH_f(water)]\n\nΔH_reaction = [(-1274 kJ/mol) + (-1266 kJ/mol)] - [(-2227 kJ/mol) + 0]\n\nΔH_reaction = (-2540 kJ/mol) - (-2227 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH_reaction = 313 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of sucrose is 313 kJ/mol."
