    "message_2": "The mechanism for a ligand substitution reaction between [Co(H2O)6]2+ and Cl- in aqueous solution can be described as follows:\n\n1. Initial complex: The starting complex is hexaaquacobalt(II) ion, [Co(H2O)6]2+, which is an octahedral complex with six water molecules coordinated to the central cobalt(II) ion.\n\n2. Formation of an intermediate: A chloride ion (Cl-) from the aqueous solution approaches the [Co(H2O)6]2+ complex and forms a bond with the cobalt(II) ion. This results in a seven-coordinate intermediate, where the cobalt(II) ion is bonded to six water molecules and one chloride ion.\n\n3. Dissociation of a water molecule: One of the water molecules in the seven-coordinate intermediate dissociates, leaving the complex. This results in the formation of a new octahedral complex, [Co(H2O)5Cl]+, with five water molecules and one chloride ion coordinated to the cobalt(II) ion. The overall reaction can be represented as:\n\n[Co(H2O)6]2+ + Cl- â†’ [Co(H2O)5Cl]+ + H2O\n\nThis mechanism is known as an associative ligand substitution reaction, where the incoming ligand (Cl-) forms a bond with the metal ion before the dissociation of the original ligand (H2O). The rate-determining step in this reaction is the formation of the seven-coordinate intermediate."
