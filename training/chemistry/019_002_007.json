Use Hess's law and the given standard enthalpies of reaction to determine the value: \n\n2H2(g) + CO(g) → CH3OH(g); ΔH°rxn = -128.2 kJ/mol \n\nH2(g) + 1/2O2(g) → H2O(l); ΔH°rxn = -285.8 kJ/mol \n\nC(s) + O2(g) → CO2(g); ΔH°rxn = -393.5 kJ/mol",
    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy of formation of methanol (CH3OH), we need to manipulate the given reactions and their enthalpies to obtain the desired reaction: C(s) + 2H2(g) + 1/2O2(g) → CH3OH(g).\n\nFirst, reverse the third reaction and divide the second reaction by 2:\n\n1. 2H2(g) + CO(g) → CH3OH(g); ΔH°rxn = -128.2 kJ/mol\n2. H2(g) + 1/4O2(g) → 1/2H2O(l); ΔH°rxn = -285.8 kJ/mol / 2 = -142.9 kJ/mol\n3. CO2(g) → C(s) + O2(g); ΔH°rxn = +393.5 kJ/mol\n\nNow, subtract the second reaction from the first reaction and add the third reaction:\n\n(1 - 2) + 3:\n2H2(g) + CO(g) - H2(g) - 1/4O2(g) + CO2(g) → CH3OH(g) - 1/2H2O(l) + C(s) + O2(g)\n\nThis simplifies to:\nH2(g) + CO(g) + CO2(g) → CH3OH(g) + C(s) + 3/4O2(g)\n\nNow, subtract the third reaction from the above reaction:\n\n(H2(g) + CO(g) + CO2(g) → CH3OH(g) + C(s) + 3/4O2(g)) - (CO2(g) → C(s) + O2(g))\n\nThis results in:\nH2(g) + CO(g) → CH3OH(g) + 1/4O2(g)\n\nFinally, multiply the second reaction by 2 and add it to the above reaction:\n\n(H2(g) + CO(g) → CH3OH(g) + 1/4O2(g)) + 2(H2(g) + 1/4O2(g) → 1/2H2O(l))\n\nThis gives us the desired reaction:\nC(s) + 2H2(g) + 1/2O2(g) → CH3OH(g)\n\nNow, we can find the enthalpy change for the desired reaction using Hess's law:\n\nΔH°formation = (-128.2 kJ/mol - 2 * -142.9 kJ/mol) + 393.5 kJ/mol = -128.2 + 285.8 + 393.5 = 551.1 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy of formation of methanol (CH3OH) is 551.1 kJ/mol."
