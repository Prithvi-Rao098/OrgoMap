    "message_2": "In the Lewis structure of carbon dioxide (CO2), there are a total of 16 valence electrons involved in the chemical bonding. Carbon has 4 valence electrons, and each oxygen atom has 6 valence electrons. The molecule consists of one carbon atom double bonded to two oxygen atoms (O=C=O). Each double bond consists of 4 electrons (2 pairs), so there are 8 electrons (4 pairs) involved in the double bonds, and the remaining 8 electrons (4 pairs) are distributed as lone pairs on the oxygen atoms."
