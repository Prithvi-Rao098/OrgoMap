    "message_1": "A student has a sample of an unknown inorganic compound that contains only carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen. They perform a combustion analysis on a 0.230 g sample of the compound, which yields 0.535 g of CO2 and 0.184 g of H2O. Additionally, when the compound is analyzed using a mass spectrometer, the mass spectrum shows a molecular ion peak at m/z = 42. Determine the empirical and molecular formulas of this compound.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to determine the moles of carbon and oxygen in the compound using the masses of CO2 and H2O produced.\n\n1. Moles of carbon:\nFrom the combustion analysis, we know that 0.535 g of CO2 is produced. The molar mass of CO2 is 12.01 g/mol (C) + 2 * 16.00 g/mol (O) = 44.01 g/mol. \n\nMoles of carbon = mass of CO2 / molar mass of CO2\nMoles of carbon = 0.535 g / 44.01 g/mol = 0.01216 mol\n\n2. Moles of oxygen:\nFrom the combustion analysis, we know that 0.184 g of H2O is produced. The molar mass of H2O is 2 * 1.01 g/mol (H) + 16.00 g/mol (O) = 18.02 g/mol.\n\nMoles of oxygen = mass of H2O / molar mass of H2O\nMoles of oxygen = 0.184 g / 18.02 g/mol = 0.01022 mol\n\nNow, we need to find the moles of nitrogen in the compound. We know the total mass of the compound is 0.230 g.\n\nMass of nitrogen = total mass - mass of carbon - mass of oxygen\nMass of nitrogen = 0.230 g - (0.01216 mol * 12.01 g/mol) - (0.01022 mol * 16.00 g/mol)\nMass of nitrogen = 0.230 g - 0.146 g - 0.163 g = -0.079 g\n\nThe mass of nitrogen is negative, which indicates an error in the analysis or a mistake in the problem statement. Please recheck the given data and try again."
