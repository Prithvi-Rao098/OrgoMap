    "message_2": "Quantum chemical calculations of excited states of a molecule play a crucial role in understanding its electronic structure and the absorption spectrum. These calculations provide valuable insights into the behavior of electrons within a molecule and their response to external stimuli, such as light. Here are some ways in which these calculations contribute to our understanding:\n\n1. Determination of electronic transitions: Quantum chemical calculations help identify the possible electronic transitions between different energy levels within a molecule. These transitions are responsible for the absorption of light at specific wavelengths, which forms the basis of the absorption spectrum.\n\n2. Prediction of absorption spectra: By calculating the energy differences between the ground state and various excited states, quantum chemical methods can predict the wavelengths at which a molecule will absorb light. This information can be used to simulate the absorption spectrum, which can then be compared with experimental data to validate the accuracy of the calculations.\n\n3. Identification of molecular orbitals: Quantum chemical calculations provide information about the molecular orbitals involved in electronic transitions. This helps in understanding the nature of the electronic states, such as whether they are localized or delocalized, and their contribution to the overall electronic structure of the molecule.\n\n4. Analysis of excited-state properties: Quantum chemical methods can provide information about the geometric and electronic structure of excited states, which can be used to understand the changes in molecular properties upon excitation. This can help in predicting the behavior of molecules in various excited states, such as their reactivity, stability, and interactions with other molecules.\n\n5. Investigation of photochemical processes: By studying the excited states of a molecule, quantum chemical calculations can help in understanding the mechanisms of various photochemical processes, such as energy transfer, electron transfer, and photo-induced reactions. This information is crucial for designing molecules with specific photochemical properties, such as light-harvesting systems and photocatalysts.\n\nIn summary, quantum chemical calculations of excited states provide a detailed understanding of a molecule's electronic structure and the absorption spectrum. This information is essential for predicting and interpreting the behavior of molecules in various environments and for designing molecules with desired properties."
