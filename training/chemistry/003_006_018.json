    "message_2": "When a molecule undergoes a phase transition, such as melting from a solid to a liquid or boiling from a liquid to a gas, its vibrational frequencies can change due to the altered intermolecular interactions and molecular environment in the new phase. These changes can be observed through spectroscopic techniques, such as infrared (IR) or Raman spectroscopy.\n\nIn the solid phase, molecules are closely packed together and have strong intermolecular forces, such as hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, or dipole-dipole interactions. These forces restrict the movement of the molecules, leading to quantized vibrational modes with well-defined frequencies. In the solid state, the vibrational frequencies are generally higher due to the more rigid structure and stronger intermolecular forces.\n\nUpon melting to a liquid, the molecules gain more freedom to move and rotate, and the intermolecular forces become weaker. This results in a change in the vibrational frequencies, which can be observed as a shift in the spectroscopic peaks. Generally, the vibrational frequencies in the liquid phase are lower than in the solid phase due to the increased molecular motion and weaker intermolecular forces.\n\nWhen the substance boils and transitions to the gas phase, the molecules are even more separated from each other, and the intermolecular forces become negligible. In this phase, the vibrational frequencies are mainly determined by the intrinsic properties of the molecule, such as its bond strengths and atomic masses. The vibrational frequencies in the gas phase can be different from those in the liquid and solid phases, and the changes can be observed through spectroscopy.\n\nIn summary, the vibrational frequencies of a molecule change when it undergoes a phase transition due to the altered intermolecular interactions and molecular environment. These changes can be observed through spectroscopic techniques, and they generally involve a decrease in vibrational frequencies as the substance transitions from a solid to a liquid to a gas."
