    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat required for subliming 20 g of iodine, we first need to determine the number of moles of iodine present in 20 g. The molar mass of iodine (I2) is approximately 253.8 g/mol.\n\nNumber of moles = mass / molar mass\nNumber of moles = 20 g / 253.8 g/mol = 0.0788 mol\n\nNow, we can use the heat of sublimation (62.44 kJ/mol) to calculate the amount of heat required to sublime this amount of iodine.\n\nHeat required = number of moles × heat of sublimation\nHeat required = 0.0788 mol × 62.44 kJ/mol = 4.92 kJ\n\nTherefore, the amount of heat required for subliming 20 g of iodine at its melting point of 387 K is approximately 4.92 kJ."
