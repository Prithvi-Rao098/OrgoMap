    "message_2": "The molecule CH3CH=CHCH3 is an alkene with the molecular formula C4H8. The isomerism exhibited by this molecule is geometrical isomerism (cis-trans isomerism) due to the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond.\n\nThere are two isomers of this molecule:\n\n1. (Z)-but-2-ene (cis-but-2-ene): In this isomer, the two methyl (CH3) groups are on the same side of the double bond.\n2. (E)-but-2-ene (trans-but-2-ene): In this isomer, the two methyl (CH3) groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.\n\nSo, the molecule CH3CH=CHCH3 has two isomers."
