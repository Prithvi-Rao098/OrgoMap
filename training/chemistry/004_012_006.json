    "message_2": "To find the percent composition of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in glucose, we first need to know the molecular formula of glucose, which is C₆H₁₂O₆. Next, we need to find the molar mass of each element in the compound and the molar mass of the entire compound.\n\n1. Molar mass of Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol\n2. Molar mass of Hydrogen (H): 1.01 g/mol\n3. Molar mass of Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol\n\nNow, let's find the molar mass of glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆):\n(6 * 12.01) + (12 * 1.01) + (6 * 16.00) = 72.06 + 12.12 + 96.00 = 180.18 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the percent composition of each element in glucose:\n\nPercent composition of Carbon (C):\n(72.06 g/mol C) / (180.18 g/mol glucose) * 100 = 39.996% ≈ 40.00%\n\nPercent composition of Hydrogen (H):\n(12.12 g/mol H) / (180.18 g/mol glucose) * 100 = 6.726% ≈ 6.73%\n\nPercent composition of Oxygen (O):\n(96.00 g/mol O) / (180.18 g/mol glucose) * 100 = 53.278% ≈ 53.28%\n\nSo, the percent composition of glucose is approximately 40.00% Carbon, 6.73% Hydrogen, and 53.28% Oxygen."
