    "message_2": "When a carbon dioxide (CO2) molecule absorbs energy and transitions from its ground state to an excited state, its molecular structure undergoes changes in vibrational and rotational energy levels, according to quantum mechanics principles.\n\nCO2 is a linear molecule with a central carbon atom double-bonded to two oxygen atoms (O=C=O). It has four vibrational modes: symmetric stretching, asymmetric stretching, and two bending modes. In the ground state, the molecule has the lowest possible energy levels for these vibrational modes.\n\nWhen the CO2 molecule absorbs energy, it can transition to an excited state, where one or more of its vibrational modes are excited to higher energy levels. These transitions occur in discrete energy quanta, as dictated by quantum mechanics. For example, the symmetric stretching mode may be excited to a higher vibrational level, causing the bond lengths between the carbon and oxygen atoms to oscillate with greater amplitude.\n\nIn addition to vibrational excitations, the CO2 molecule can also undergo changes in its rotational energy levels. The molecule can absorb energy and transition to higher rotational states, causing it to rotate faster around its center of mass. These transitions also occur in discrete energy quanta, as described by quantum mechanics.\n\nIn summary, when a CO2 molecule absorbs energy and transitions from its ground state to an excited state, its molecular structure experiences changes in vibrational and rotational energy levels. These changes occur in discrete energy quanta, as dictated by quantum mechanics principles."
