    "message_2": "To determine the yield of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, we first need to find the limiting reactant in the reaction. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nN2H4 + C6H3Cl(NO2)2 → C6H3(NO2)2N2H3 + HCl\n\nNow, let's find the moles of each reactant:\n\nMolar mass of hydrazine (N2H4) = (2 × 14.01) + (4 × 1.01) = 32.05 g/mol\nMoles of hydrazine = 5 g / 32.05 g/mol = 0.156 mol\n\nMolar mass of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (C6H3Cl(NO2)2) = (6 × 12.01) + (3 × 1.01) + 35.45 + (2 × (14.01 + (2 × 16))) = 202.56 g/mol\nMoles of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene = 10 g / 202.56 g/mol = 0.049 mol\n\nNow, let's find the mole ratio of the reactants:\n\nMole ratio = moles of hydrazine / moles of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene = 0.156 / 0.049 = 3.18\n\nSince the mole ratio is greater than 1, the limiting reactant is 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene.\n\nNow, let's find the theoretical yield of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine:\n\nMolar mass of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (C6H3(NO2)2N2H3) = (6 × 12.01) + (3 × 1.01) + (2 × (14.01 + (2 × 16))) + (2 × 14.01) + (3 × 1.01) = 198.14 g/mol\n\nTheoretical yield = moles of limiting reactant × molar mass of product = 0.049 mol × 198.14 g/mol = 9.72 g\n\nAssuming the reaction goes to completion and there are no side reactions or losses, the yield of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine would be 9.72 grams. However, in practice, the actual yield is often lower than the theoretical yield due to various factors such as side reactions, incomplete reactions, and losses during purification."
