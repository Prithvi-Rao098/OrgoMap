    "message_2": "The oxidation of an alcohol to a carboxylic acid using potassium permanganate (KMnO4) as the oxidizing agent typically proceeds through the following steps:\n\n1. Formation of the alkoxide ion:\nThe alcohol (R-OH) reacts with a strong base (typically hydroxide ions, OH-) to form an alkoxide ion (R-O-). This step is necessary to increase the nucleophilicity of the oxygen atom in the alcohol.\n\nR-OH + OH- → R-O- + H2O\n\n2. Nucleophilic attack on the permanganate ion:\nThe alkoxide ion (R-O-) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the manganese atom in the permanganate ion (MnO4-), breaking one of the Mn=O double bonds and forming a new bond between the oxygen atom of the alkoxide ion and the manganese atom.\n\nR-O- + MnO4- → R-O-MnO3\n\n3. Rearrangement and formation of the carbonyl group:\nThe intermediate species (R-O-MnO3) undergoes a rearrangement, which involves the transfer of a hydride ion (H-) from the carbon atom adjacent to the oxygen atom to the manganese atom. This results in the formation of a carbonyl group (C=O) and a manganese-containing byproduct.\n\nR-O-MnO3 → R-C=O + Mn-containing byproduct\n\n4. Hydrolysis of the carbonyl group:\nThe carbonyl group (C=O) is hydrolyzed in the presence of water, forming a carboxylic acid (R-COOH).\n\nR-C=O + H2O → R-COOH\n\nOverall, the reaction mechanism for the formation of a carboxylic acid from an alcohol using potassium permanganate involves the formation of an alkoxide ion, nucleophilic attack on the permanganate ion, rearrangement to form a carbonyl group, and hydrolysis to form the carboxylic acid."
