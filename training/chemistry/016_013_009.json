    "message_2": "To calculate the heat of hydration for magnesium ion, we first need to find the heat released when 0.5 moles of magnesium chloride is dissolved in water. We can use the enthalpy change of solution for magnesium chloride to find this.\n\nEnthalpy change of solution for magnesium chloride = -641 kJ/mol\nMoles of magnesium chloride = 0.5 moles\n\nHeat released during dissolution = Enthalpy change of solution × Moles of magnesium chloride\nHeat released = -641 kJ/mol × 0.5 moles = -320.5 kJ\n\nNow, we need to find the heat absorbed by the water. We can use the specific heat capacity of water and the temperature change to find this.\n\nSpecific heat capacity of water = 4.18 J/g°C\nMass of water = 500 ml = 500 g (assuming the density of water is 1 g/ml)\nInitial temperature of water = 25°C\nFinal temperature of water = T\n\nHeat absorbed by water = Mass of water × Specific heat capacity × (Final temperature - Initial temperature)\nHeat absorbed = 500 g × 4.18 J/g°C × (T - 25°C)\n\nSince the heat released during dissolution is equal to the heat absorbed by the water, we can set up the following equation:\n\n-320.5 kJ = 500 g × 4.18 J/g°C × (T - 25°C)\n\nFirst, we need to convert kJ to J:\n\n-320.5 kJ × 1000 J/1 kJ = -320500 J\n\nNow, we can solve for T:\n\n-320500 J = 500 g × 4.18 J/g°C × (T - 25°C)\n\n-320500 J = 2090 J/°C × (T - 25°C)\n\nDivide both sides by 2090 J/°C:\n\n-153.11 = T - 25°C\n\nAdd 25 to both sides:\n\nT = -128.11°C\n\nSince the final temperature is lower than the initial temperature, the heat of hydration for magnesium ion is exothermic. The heat of hydration for magnesium ion when 0.5 moles of magnesium chloride is dissolved in 500 ml of water at 25°C is -320.5 kJ."
