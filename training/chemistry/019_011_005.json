    "message_2": "The standard enthalpy change (∆H°f) for the formation of methane gas (CH4) from its elements in their standard states at 298 K is already given in the problem:\n\n∆H°f (CH4, g) = -74.8 kJ/mol\n\nThis value represents the enthalpy change when one mole of methane gas is formed from its elements (carbon and hydrogen) in their standard states at 298 K."
