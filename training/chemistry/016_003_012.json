    "message_1": "What is the bond dissociation energy of a carbon-carbon triple bond in ethyne gas (C2H2)? Provide the calculation and units for your answer.",
    "message_2": "The bond dissociation energy (BDE) is the energy required to break a bond between two atoms. In the case of ethyne gas (C2H2), we are interested in the carbon-carbon triple bond. The BDE for a carbon-carbon triple bond in ethyne is approximately 839 kJ/mol.\n\nThis value is determined experimentally and can be found in reference materials such as chemistry textbooks or databases. The units for bond dissociation energy are typically given in kilojoules per mole (kJ/mol), which represents the energy required to break one mole of the specified bond."
