    "message_2": "To calculate the reaction quotient (Qc) for the given reaction, we need to use the formula:\n\nQc = [Products]^coefficients / [Reactants]^coefficients\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\n2 NO2(g) + F2(g) ⇌ 2 NO2F(g)\n\nQc = [NO2F]^2 / ([NO2]^2 * [F2])\n\nNow, we can plug in the given molar concentrations:\n\nQc = (0.10)^2 / ((0.25)^2 * (0.15))\n\nQc = 0.01 / (0.0625 * 0.15)\n\nQc = 0.01 / 0.009375\n\nQc ≈ 1.067\n\nTherefore, the reaction quotient (Qc) for the given reaction at 298 K and 1 atm is approximately 1.067."
