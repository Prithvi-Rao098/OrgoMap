    "message_2": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a linear molecule with a central carbon atom double-bonded to two oxygen atoms. The molecular geometry of CO2 is linear, with the carbon atom in the middle and the two oxygen atoms on either side.\n\nTo determine the dipole moment of CO2, we first need to consider the electronegativity of the atoms involved. Oxygen is more electronegative than carbon, which means that the electrons in the C=O bonds are more attracted to the oxygen atoms. This creates a bond dipole moment, with a partial negative charge on the oxygen atoms and a partial positive charge on the carbon atom.\n\nHowever, due to the linear geometry of the CO2 molecule, the bond dipole moments of the two C=O bonds are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. As a result, these bond dipole moments cancel each other out, leading to an overall dipole moment of zero for the CO2 molecule.\n\nIn summary, although CO2 has polar C=O bonds, its linear molecular geometry causes the bond dipole moments to cancel each other out, resulting in an overall dipole moment of zero. This means that CO2 is a nonpolar molecule."
