    "message_2": "To determine if a given molecule has isomers and identify them, follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the molecular formula: Calculate the molecular formula of the given molecule by counting the number of atoms of each element present in the molecule.\n\n2. Identify the types of isomers: There are two main types of isomers - structural isomers and stereoisomers. Structural isomers have the same molecular formula but different arrangements of atoms, while stereoisomers have the same molecular formula and arrangement of atoms but differ in the orientation of atoms in space.\n\n3. Analyze the structure for structural isomers: Examine the connectivity of atoms in the molecule and identify possible alternative arrangements of atoms that result in different structures. These alternative structures are the structural isomers of the given molecule. Common types of structural isomers include chain isomers, positional isomers, and functional group isomers.\n\n4. Analyze the structure for stereoisomers: If the molecule contains chiral centers (carbon atoms with four different groups attached) or double bonds with different groups on each side, it may have stereoisomers. Stereoisomers can be further classified into enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images) and diastereomers (non-mirror image stereoisomers).\n\n5. Draw the isomers: Once you have identified the possible isomers, draw their structures using appropriate chemical notation. For stereoisomers, use wedge and dash notation to represent the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms.\n\n6. Verify the isomers: Ensure that the drawn isomers have the same molecular formula as the original molecule and that they are not identical to each other or the original molecule. This step helps to eliminate any duplicate or incorrect isomers.\n\n7. Name the isomers: Assign IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) names to the identified isomers to distinguish them from each other.\n\nBy following these steps, you can determine if a given molecule has isomers and identify the different isomeric forms."
