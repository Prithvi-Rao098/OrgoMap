    "message_2": "The formation of N-methylacetamide from N-methylamine and acetic anhydride is an example of a nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction. Here's the step-by-step mechanism for this reaction:\n\n1. Nucleophilic attack: The nitrogen atom in N-methylamine (CH3NH2) acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbonyl carbon in acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O). This results in the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate and breaking of the carbonyl double bond (π bond).\n\n2. Proton transfer: The negatively charged oxygen atom in the tetrahedral intermediate abstracts a proton from the nitrogen atom in the N-methylamine moiety, forming a hydroxyl group (-OH) and restoring the positive charge on the nitrogen atom.\n\n3. Leaving group departure: The hydroxyl group (-OH) in the tetrahedral intermediate acts as a leaving group, and the carbonyl double bond (π bond) is reformed. This results in the expulsion of acetate ion (CH3COO-) as a leaving group.\n\n4. Proton transfer: The positively charged nitrogen atom in the N-methylacetamide (CH3NHCOCH3) abstracts a proton from the acetate ion (CH3COO-), forming the final N-methylacetamide product and an acetic acid molecule (CH3COOH).\n\nOverall, the reaction can be summarized as follows:\n\nN-methylamine (CH3NH2) + Acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O) → N-methylacetamide (CH3NHCOCH3) + Acetic acid (CH3COOH)"
