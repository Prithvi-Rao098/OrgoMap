    "message_2": "The standard enthalpy change for the vaporization reaction of ethanol (C2H5OH) is the heat of vaporization at its boiling point. In this case, the heat of vaporization is given as 38.56 kJ/mol at 78.4 °C. Therefore, the standard enthalpy change for the vaporization reaction of ethanol is 38.56 kJ/mol."
