    "message_2": "To calculate the formal charge of the sulfur atom in the sulfite ion (SO3²⁻), we will use the formula for formal charge calculation:\n\nFormal charge = (Valence electrons of the atom) - (Non-bonding electrons) - 0.5 * (Bonding electrons)\n\nIn the case of the sulfite ion, the sulfur atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms, and each bond is a double bond. Sulfur belongs to Group 6 in the periodic table, so it has 6 valence electrons.\n\nNon-bonding electrons: Since all three oxygen atoms are double bonded to the sulfur atom, there are no lone pairs on the sulfur atom. Therefore, the number of non-bonding electrons is 0.\n\nBonding electrons: Each double bond consists of 2 pairs of electrons, so there are 2 * 3 = 6 bonding electrons involved in the double bonds.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nFormal charge of S = (6) - (0) - 0.5 * (6)\nFormal charge of S = 6 - 0 - 3\nFormal charge of S = 3\n\nSo, the formal charge of the sulfur atom in the sulfite ion (SO3²⁻) is +3."
