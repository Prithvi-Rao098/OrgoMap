    "message_2": "Ozone (O3) has two resonance structures that contribute to its overall molecular structure. These resonance structures involve the movement of electrons between the three oxygen atoms.\n\nResonance Structure 1:\nO = O - O\n\nResonance Structure 2:\nO - O = O\n\nIn both resonance structures, there is one double bond and one single bond. However, the actual bond lengths and bond orders in the ozone molecule are an average of these two resonance structures.\n\nBond lengths:\n- Double bond: shorter than a typical single bond, approximately 1.21 Å (angstroms)\n- Single bond: longer than a typical double bond, approximately 1.28 Å (angstroms)\n\nSince the actual structure of ozone is a hybrid of the two resonance structures, the bond lengths in the molecule are intermediate between a single and double bond, approximately 1.24 Å.\n\nBond orders:\n- Double bond: bond order of 2\n- Single bond: bond order of 1\n\nThe actual bond order in the ozone molecule is an average of the two resonance structures, which is 1.5. This means that the bonds in the ozone molecule are intermediate between a single and double bond in terms of strength and stability."
