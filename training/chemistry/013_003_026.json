    "message_2": "The Langmuir adsorption isotherm equation is used to describe the adsorption of molecules onto a surface, such as a metal oxide surface. The equation is given by:\n\nθ = (K * P) / (1 + K * P)\n\nwhere:\nθ = fractional coverage of the surface (adsorbed molecules / total available sites)\nK = Langmuir constant, which depends on the specific adsorbate, adsorbent, and temperature\nP = partial pressure of the adsorbate\n\nThe maximum adsorption capacity of a metal oxide surface for a specific type of molecule at a particular temperature can be determined by finding the value of θ when it reaches its maximum value, which is 1 (meaning the surface is fully covered with adsorbed molecules).\n\nTo find the maximum adsorption capacity, we can set θ = 1 and solve for P:\n\n1 = (K * P) / (1 + K * P)\n\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\nP = 1 / K\n\nThis means that the maximum adsorption capacity is reached when the partial pressure of the adsorbate is equal to the inverse of the Langmuir constant (1/K). Note that the Langmuir constant depends on the specific adsorbate, adsorbent, and temperature, so you would need to know or determine the value of K for your specific system to find the maximum adsorption capacity."
