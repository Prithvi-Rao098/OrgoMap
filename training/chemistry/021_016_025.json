    "message_2": "To calculate the electronegativity difference between hydrogen and chlorine, we subtract the electronegativity value of hydrogen from that of chlorine:\n\nElectronegativity difference = Electronegativity of chlorine - Electronegativity of hydrogen\nElectronegativity difference = 3.16 - 2.20\nElectronegativity difference = 0.96\n\nNow, let's determine the type of bond formed between them according to the electronegativity difference classification:\n\n1. Nonpolar covalent bond: Electronegativity difference ≤ 0.4\n2. Polar covalent bond: Electronegativity difference between 0.4 and 1.7\n3. Ionic bond: Electronegativity difference ≥ 1.7\n\nSince the electronegativity difference between hydrogen and chlorine is 0.96, the bond formed between them is a polar covalent bond."
