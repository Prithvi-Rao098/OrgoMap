    "message_2": "To find the enthalpy change of the desired reaction using Hess's Law, we need to manipulate the given reactions in such a way that when they are added together, they result in the desired reaction. \n\nFirst, let's reverse the first reaction and divide it by 2:\n\n2NO2 (g) → 2NO (g) + O2 (g)    ΔH = +114.2 kJ/mol\n\nNow, let's reverse the second reaction:\n\n2NO2 (g) → N2 (g) + 2O2 (g)    ΔH = +68.0 kJ/mol\n\nFinally, let's multiply the third reaction by 1.5:\n\n3H2 (g) + 1.5O2 (g) → 3H2O (g)    ΔH = -725.4 kJ/mol\n\nNow, let's add the modified reactions together:\n\n2NO2 (g) → 2NO (g) + O2 (g)    ΔH = +114.2 kJ/mol\n2NO2 (g) → N2 (g) + 2O2 (g)    ΔH = +68.0 kJ/mol\n3H2 (g) + 1.5O2 (g) → 3H2O (g)    ΔH = -725.4 kJ/mol\n----------------------------------------------\n2H2O (g) + 2NO (g) → N2O (g) + 3H2O (g)    ΔH = ?\n\nNow, sum the enthalpy changes:\n\nΔH = +114.2 kJ/mol + 68.0 kJ/mol - 725.4 kJ/mol = -543.2 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the enthalpy change of the desired reaction is -543.2 kJ/mol."
