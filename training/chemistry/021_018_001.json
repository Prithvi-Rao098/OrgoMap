    "message_1": "\"What is the effect of increasing the strength of intermolecular forces on the boiling point of a substance?\"",
    "message_2": "Increasing the strength of intermolecular forces in a substance generally leads to a higher boiling point. This is because stronger intermolecular forces require more energy to overcome, so a greater amount of heat is needed to break these forces and convert the substance from a liquid to a gas. As a result, the boiling point of the substance increases."
