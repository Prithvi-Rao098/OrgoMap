    "message_2": "The reaction of tert-butyl alcohol (t-BuOH) with hydrochloric acid (HCl) to produce tert-butyl chloride (t-BuCl) is an example of an acid-catalyzed substitution reaction, specifically a nucleophilic substitution at a tertiary carbon (SN1 mechanism).\n\nHere is the step-by-step mechanism and intermediates involved in this reaction:\n\n1. Protonation of tert-butyl alcohol: The oxygen atom of the tert-butyl alcohol molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks the hydrogen atom of the hydrochloric acid molecule. This results in the formation of a protonated tert-butyl alcohol (t-BuOH2+) and a chloride ion (Cl-).\n\nIntermediate: Protonated tert-butyl alcohol (t-BuOH2+)\n\n2. Formation of carbocation: The protonated tert-butyl alcohol molecule undergoes heterolysis, where the bond between the oxygen and the tertiary carbon breaks. The oxygen atom takes both electrons from the bond, leaving a positively charged tert-butyl carbocation (t-Bu+) and a water molecule (H2O).\n\nIntermediate: Tert-butyl carbocation (t-Bu+)\n\n3. Nucleophilic attack: The chloride ion (Cl-) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the positively charged tert-butyl carbocation (t-Bu+), forming a new bond between the chloride ion and the tertiary carbon. This results in the formation of the tert-butyl chloride (t-BuCl) product.\n\nProduct: Tert-butyl chloride (t-BuCl)\n\nOverall, the reaction proceeds through two intermediates: protonated tert-butyl alcohol (t-BuOH2+) and tert-butyl carbocation (t-Bu+). The mechanism involves an acid-catalyzed nucleophilic substitution at a tertiary carbon (SN1 mechanism)."
