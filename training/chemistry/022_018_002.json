    "message_2": "To calculate the bond energy required to break a single bond between two nitrogen atoms in a molecule of nitrogen gas (N2), we can use the given bond dissociation energy of N2, which is 945 kJ/mol. Since there is only one bond between the two nitrogen atoms in N2, the bond energy for breaking this single bond is equal to the bond dissociation energy.\n\nTherefore, the bond energy required to break a single bond between two nitrogen atoms in N2 is 945 kJ/mol."
