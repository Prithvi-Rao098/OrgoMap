    "message_2": "To find the activation energy (Ea) of the reaction, we can use the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk = A * e^(-Ea / R * T)\n\nwhere k is the rate constant, A is the pre-exponential factor, Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol*K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nWe are given k = 0.01 s^-1, A = 2.5 * 10^8 s^-1, and T = 298 K. We need to solve for Ea.\n\n0.01 = 2.5 * 10^8 * e^(-Ea / (8.314 * 298))\n\nFirst, we will isolate the exponential term by dividing both sides by the pre-exponential factor:\n\n(0.01) / (2.5 * 10^8) = e^(-Ea / (8.314 * 298))\n\n4 * 10^-10 = e^(-Ea / (8.314 * 298))\n\nNow, we will take the natural logarithm of both sides to remove the exponential:\n\nln(4 * 10^-10) = -Ea / (8.314 * 298)\n\n-21.62 = -Ea / (8.314 * 298)\n\nNext, we will multiply both sides by -1:\n\n21.62 = Ea / (8.314 * 298)\n\nFinally, we will multiply both sides by (8.314 * 298) to solve for Ea:\n\nEa = 21.62 * (8.314 * 298)\n\nEa â‰ˆ 53340 J/mol\n\nThe activation energy of the reaction is approximately 53,340 J/mol."
