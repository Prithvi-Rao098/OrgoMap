    "message_2": "The type of bonding present in diamond is covalent bonding. Covalent bonding occurs when atoms share electrons to form a bond. In the case of diamond, each carbon atom is covalently bonded to four other carbon atoms, creating a strong and stable tetrahedral structure. This type of bonding can be justified by examining the physical and chemical properties of diamond.\n\n1. High melting and boiling points: Diamond has a very high melting point of about 3,550 degrees Celsius (6,420 degrees Fahrenheit) and a high boiling point of about 4,027 degrees Celsius (7,280 degrees Fahrenheit). These high temperatures are due to the strong covalent bonds between the carbon atoms, which require a large amount of energy to break.\n\n2. Hardness: Diamond is the hardest known natural material, with a rating of 10 on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness. This extreme hardness is a result of the strong covalent bonds between the carbon atoms, which create a rigid and durable lattice structure.\n\n3. Low electrical conductivity: Diamond is an electrical insulator, meaning it does not conduct electricity well. This is because the electrons in the covalent bonds are not free to move and carry an electrical charge.\n\n4. Chemical inertness: Diamond is chemically inert, meaning it does not readily react with other chemicals. This is due to the strong covalent bonds between the carbon atoms, which make it difficult for other atoms or molecules to interact with the diamond lattice.\n\n5. Transparency: Diamond is transparent to visible light because its covalent bonds do not absorb light in the visible spectrum. This allows light to pass through the diamond without being absorbed or scattered, giving it its characteristic sparkle and brilliance.\n\nIn summary, the covalent bonding present in diamond is responsible for its unique physical and chemical properties, such as its high melting and boiling points, hardness, low electrical conductivity, chemical inertness, and transparency."
