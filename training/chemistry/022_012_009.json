    "message_2": "To find the molarity of the hydrochloric acid solution, we can use the concept of stoichiometry and the balanced chemical equation for the neutralization reaction between hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH):\n\nHCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H2O(l)\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that the mole ratio between HCl and NaOH is 1:1.\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of NaOH in the reaction:\n\nmoles of NaOH = Molarity × Volume\nmoles of NaOH = 0.15 M × 0.035 L (converting mL to L)\nmoles of NaOH = 0.00525 moles\n\nSince the mole ratio between HCl and NaOH is 1:1, the moles of HCl that reacted are also 0.00525 moles.\n\nNow we can find the molarity of the HCl solution:\n\nMolarity of HCl = moles of HCl / Volume of HCl\nMolarity of HCl = 0.00525 moles / 0.025 L (converting mL to L)\nMolarity of HCl = 0.21 M\n\nSo, the molarity of the hydrochloric acid solution is 0.21 M."
