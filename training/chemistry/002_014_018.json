    "message_2": "To determine the formal charge of sulfur (S) in the sulfate ion (SO4)2-, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the number of valence electrons for sulfur. Sulfur is in group 16, so it has 6 valence electrons.\n\n2. Determine the number of electrons assigned to sulfur in the sulfate ion. In the sulfate ion, sulfur is bonded to four oxygen atoms, each with a double bond. Each double bond consists of 2 shared electrons, so sulfur shares a total of 8 electrons with the oxygen atoms. Since half of the shared electrons are assigned to sulfur, it has 4 assigned electrons.\n\n3. Calculate the formal charge of sulfur using the formula: Formal charge = (Valence electrons) - (Assigned electrons) - (Non-bonding electrons)\n\nIn this case, there are no non-bonding electrons on sulfur, so the formula becomes:\n\nFormal charge = (6) - (4) = +2\n\nThe formal charge of sulfur (S) in the sulfate ion (SO4)2- is +2."
