Here's a question for a chemistry student to solve relating to Hess's Law calculations:\n\nUsing Hess's Law, calculate the standard enthalpy change (∆H°) for the combustion of ethene (C2H4) to form carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) using the following thermochemical equations:\n\nC2H4(g) + 3 O2(g) → 2 CO2(g) + 2 H2O(g); ∆H° = -1411.1 kJ/mol\n\nC(graphite) + O2(g) → CO2(g); ∆H° = -393.5 kJ/mol\n\n2 H2(g) + O2(g) → 2 H2O(g); ∆H° = -483.6 kJ/mol",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Hess's Law, we need to manipulate the given thermochemical equations to match the target equation for the combustion of ethene. The target equation is:\n\nC2H4(g) + 3 O2(g) → 2 CO2(g) + 2 H2O(g)\n\nFirst, let's break down ethene (C2H4) into its constituent elements:\n\nC2H4(g) → 2 C(graphite) + 2 H2(g)\n\nNow, we need to manipulate the other given equations to match the target equation. For the second equation, we need 2 moles of CO2, so we'll multiply the entire equation by 2:\n\n2 [C(graphite) + O2(g) → CO2(g)] → 2 C(graphite) + 2 O2(g) → 2 CO2(g); 2 * ∆H° = 2 * -393.5 kJ/mol = -787 kJ/mol\n\nFor the third equation, it already matches the target equation for the formation of 2 moles of H2O(g), so we don't need to change it:\n\n2 H2(g) + O2(g) → 2 H2O(g); ∆H° = -483.6 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can add the manipulated equations together:\n\nC2H4(g) → 2 C(graphite) + 2 H2(g)\n2 C(graphite) + 2 O2(g) → 2 CO2(g); ∆H° = -787 kJ/mol\n2 H2(g) + O2(g) → 2 H2O(g); ∆H° = -483.6 kJ/mol\n---------------------------------------------------\nC2H4(g) + 3 O2(g) → 2 CO2(g) + 2 H2O(g)\n\nFinally, we can add the enthalpy changes of the manipulated equations to find the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of ethene:\n\n∆H° = -787 kJ/mol + (-483.6 kJ/mol) = -1270.6 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of ethene is -1270.6 kJ/mol."
