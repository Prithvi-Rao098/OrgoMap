    "message_2": "To determine the purity level of a given sample of aspirin using melting point determination, you will need to compare the melting point of the sample with the known melting point of pure aspirin. Pure aspirin, or acetylsalicylic acid, has a melting point of approximately 138-140°C.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Obtain a small sample of the aspirin to be tested and grind it into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle.\n\n2. Set up a melting point apparatus, which typically consists of a heating block or oil bath, a thermometer, and a capillary tube. The capillary tube should be sealed at one end and open at the other.\n\n3. Fill the capillary tube with the powdered aspirin sample by tapping the open end of the tube into the powder. Ensure that the sample is packed tightly in the bottom of the tube, with no air pockets.\n\n4. Attach the capillary tube to the thermometer using a rubber band, ensuring that the sample is positioned at the same level as the thermometer's bulb.\n\n5. Place the thermometer and capillary tube into the heating block or oil bath, ensuring that the sample is fully immersed in the heating medium.\n\n6. Slowly heat the apparatus, observing the sample closely. Record the temperature at which the sample begins to melt (the onset temperature) and the temperature at which it completely melts (the clear point temperature).\n\n7. Compare the melting point range (the onset temperature to the clear point temperature) of the sample to the known melting point range of pure aspirin (138-140°C).\n\nIf the melting point range of the sample is close to the known melting point range of pure aspirin and has a narrow range (1-2°C), the sample is likely to be of high purity. If the melting point range is significantly lower or broader than the known range, this indicates that the sample is impure, as impurities typically lower and broaden the melting point range.\n\nTo quantify the purity level, you can perform additional tests, such as titration or spectroscopy, to obtain a more accurate percentage of purity."
