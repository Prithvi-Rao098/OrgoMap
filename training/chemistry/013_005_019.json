    "message_2": "To calculate the surface area of the activated carbon, we need to first determine the volume of nitrogen gas adsorbed as a monolayer on the carbon.\n\nGiven:\n- Volume of nitrogen gas adsorbed = 10 mL\n- Mass of activated carbon = 0.1 g\n- Monolayer capacity = 0.5 mL/g\n\nFirst, we need to find the volume of nitrogen gas adsorbed as a monolayer:\n\nVolume of nitrogen gas adsorbed as a monolayer = mass of activated carbon × monolayer capacity\n= 0.1 g × 0.5 mL/g\n= 0.05 mL\n\nNext, we need to find the surface area of the activated carbon using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) equation:\n\nSurface area (A) = (V_mono × N_A × A_N2) / (mass of activated carbon)\n\nWhere:\n- V_mono is the volume of nitrogen gas adsorbed as a monolayer (0.05 mL)\n- N_A is Avogadro's number (6.022 × 10^23 molecules/mol)\n- A_N2 is the cross-sectional area of a nitrogen molecule (0.162 nm²)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the volume of nitrogen gas adsorbed as a monolayer from mL to moles. We can use the ideal gas law equation (PV = nRT) for this conversion:\n\nn = PV / RT\n\nWhere:\n- P is the pressure (1 atm)\n- V is the volume (0.05 mL = 0.00005 L)\n- R is the ideal gas constant (0.0821 L atm/mol K)\n- T is the temperature (25°C = 298 K)\n\nn = (1 atm × 0.00005 L) / (0.0821 L atm/mol K × 298 K)\nn = 2.03 × 10^-6 mol\n\nNow we can calculate the surface area of the activated carbon:\n\nA = (2.03 × 10^-6 mol × 6.022 × 10^23 molecules/mol × 0.162 nm²) / (0.1 g)\nA = 2.01 × 10^18 nm²/g\n\nSo, the surface area of the activated carbon is approximately 2.01 × 10^18 nm²/g."
