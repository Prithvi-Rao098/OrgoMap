    "message_1": "A student needs to prepare a buffer solution with a pH of 7.20 using acetic acid (CH3COOH) and sodium acetate (NaCH3COO), with a total buffer concentration of 0.20 M. What mass of CH3COOH needs to be added to 200 mL of 0.10 M NaCH3COO to obtain the desired pH? (Ka of CH3COOH is 1.8x10^-5)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log ([A-]/[HA])\n\nwhere pH is the desired pH of the buffer solution, pKa is the negative logarithm of the acid dissociation constant (Ka), [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base (sodium acetate), and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid (acetic acid).\n\nFirst, we need to find the pKa of acetic acid:\n\npKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.8x10^-5) = 4.74\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\n7.20 = 4.74 + log ([NaCH3COO]/[CH3COOH])\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for the ratio of [NaCH3COO] to [CH3COOH]:\n\nlog ([NaCH3COO]/[CH3COOH]) = 7.20 - 4.74 = 2.46\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of the concentrations:\n\n[NaCH3COO]/[CH3COOH] = 10^2.46 ≈ 288.4\n\nWe know that the total buffer concentration is 0.20 M, and the volume of the solution is 200 mL (0.2 L). Therefore, the total moles of buffer components in the solution are:\n\n0.20 M * 0.2 L = 0.04 moles\n\nSince we already have 200 mL of 0.10 M NaCH3COO, we have:\n\n0.10 M * 0.2 L = 0.02 moles of NaCH3COO\n\nNow, we can use the ratio we found earlier to determine the moles of CH3COOH:\n\n0.02 moles NaCH3COO / 288.4 = x moles CH3COOH / 1\n\nx moles CH3COOH = 0.02 moles / 288.4 ≈ 6.94x10^-5 moles\n\nFinally, we can find the mass of CH3COOH needed by multiplying the moles by the molar mass of CH3COOH (60.05 g/mol):\n\nmass CH3COOH = (6.94x10^-5 moles) * (60.05 g/mol) ≈ 0.00417 g\n\nSo, the student needs to add approximately 0.00417 grams of CH3COOH to the 200 mL of 0.10 M NaCH3COO to obtain the desired pH of 7.20."
