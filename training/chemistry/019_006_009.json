    "message_1": "What is the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction between nitrogen gas (N2) and hydrogen gas (H2) to form ammonia (NH3) at a temperature of 500 K, when the concentration of N2 is 0.15 M, the concentration of H2 is 0.20 M, and the concentration of NH3 is 0.10 M?",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g)\n\nNow, we can write the expression for the equilibrium constant (Kc):\n\nKc = [NH3]^2 / ([N2] * [H2]^3)\n\nGiven the concentrations of N2, H2, and NH3 at equilibrium:\n\n[N2] = 0.15 M\n[H2] = 0.20 M\n[NH3] = 0.10 M\n\nSubstitute these values into the Kc expression:\n\nKc = (0.10)^2 / (0.15 * (0.20)^3)\n\nKc = 0.01 / (0.15 * 0.008)\n\nKc = 0.01 / 0.0012\n\nKc ≈ 8.33\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction between nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas to form ammonia at a temperature of 500 K and given concentrations is approximately 8.33."
