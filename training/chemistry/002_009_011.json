    "message_2": "To find the empirical formula of a substance, we need to determine the mole ratio of the elements present in the substance. In this case, we have 9.60 grams of carbon and 32.00 grams of oxygen.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of each element to moles. We can do this by dividing the mass by the molar mass of each element.\n\nMoles of carbon (C) = mass / molar mass\nMoles of C = 9.60 g / 12.01 g/mol (molar mass of carbon)\nMoles of C ≈ 0.8 mol\n\nMoles of oxygen (O) = mass / molar mass\nMoles of O = 32.00 g / 16.00 g/mol (molar mass of oxygen)\nMoles of O = 2.0 mol\n\nNow, we need to find the mole ratio of carbon to oxygen. To do this, we divide the moles of each element by the smallest number of moles.\n\nMole ratio of C = 0.8 mol / 0.8 mol = 1\nMole ratio of O = 2.0 mol / 0.8 mol = 2.5\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction in the empirical formula, we need to multiply the mole ratios by a whole number to get whole number ratios. In this case, we can multiply both ratios by 2.\n\nMole ratio of C = 1 * 2 = 2\nMole ratio of O = 2.5 * 2 = 5\n\nSo, the empirical formula of the substance is C₂O₅."
