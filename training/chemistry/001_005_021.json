    "message_2": "The fourth member of the alkane series is butane. The molecular formula for butane is C4H10.\n\nThe structural formula for butane is:\n\nCH3-CH2-CH2-CH3\n\nThere are two possible isomers for butane:\n\n1. n-Butane (normal butane): This is the straight-chain isomer, which has the structural formula mentioned above.\n\n2. Isobutane (methylpropane): This is the branched isomer, with the structural formula:\n\nCH3\n  |\nCH3-C-CH3\n  |\n  H\n\nSo, there are 2 possible isomers for the fourth member of the alkane series, butane."
