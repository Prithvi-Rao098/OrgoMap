    "message_2": "To determine the theoretical yield of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene, we first need to find the limiting reactant in the reaction. We can do this by calculating the moles of each reactant and comparing their mole ratios.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nC₆H₅NO₂ + 2Cl₂ → C₆H₃Cl₂NO₂\n\nMolar masses:\nNitrobenzene (C₆H₅NO₂): 123.11 g/mol\nChlorine gas (Cl₂): 70.90 g/mol\n2,4-dichloronitrobenzene (C₆H₃Cl₂NO₂): 192.00 g/mol\n\nFirst, let's calculate the moles of each reactant:\n\nMoles of nitrobenzene = 10 g / 123.11 g/mol = 0.0812 mol\nMoles of chlorine gas = 20 g / 70.90 g/mol = 0.282 mol\n\nNow, let's find the mole ratio of each reactant to the product:\n\nMole ratio of nitrobenzene = 0.0812 mol / 1 (from the balanced equation) = 0.0812\nMole ratio of chlorine gas = 0.282 mol / 2 (from the balanced equation) = 0.141\n\nSince the mole ratio of nitrobenzene is smaller than that of chlorine gas, nitrobenzene is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow, we can calculate the theoretical yield of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene:\n\nTheoretical yield = moles of limiting reactant * molar mass of product\nTheoretical yield = 0.0812 mol * 192.00 g/mol = 15.59 g\n\nThe theoretical yield of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene is 15.59 grams."
