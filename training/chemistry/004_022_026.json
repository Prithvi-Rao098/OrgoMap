    "message_2": "To determine the concentration of chloride ions in a seawater sample using the potentiometry technique with a silver chloride electrode, you would need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Prepare the seawater sample: Collect a representative sample of seawater and filter it to remove any suspended particles or debris.\n\n2. Calibrate the silver chloride electrode: Prepare a series of standard chloride solutions with known concentrations (e.g., 10, 100, and 1000 mg/L). Measure the potential (voltage) of each standard solution using the silver chloride electrode and a reference electrode, such as a saturated calomel electrode. Plot the measured potentials against the logarithm of the chloride concentrations to create a calibration curve.\n\n3. Measure the potential of the seawater sample: Place the silver chloride electrode and the reference electrode in the seawater sample and measure the potential (voltage).\n\n4. Determine the chloride concentration: Use the calibration curve to find the chloride concentration corresponding to the measured potential of the seawater sample.\n\nNote that the actual chloride concentration in seawater can vary depending on the location and depth of the sample. However, the average concentration of chloride ions in seawater is approximately 19,000 mg/L or 1.9% by weight."
