    "message_2": "To find the maximum concentration of the complex ion [Cu(NH3)4]2+, we can use the formation constant (Kf) expression and an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) to determine the equilibrium concentrations of the species involved in the reaction.\n\nThe reaction for the formation of the complex ion is:\n\nCu2+ + 4NH3 <=> [Cu(NH3)4]2+\n\nThe Kf expression for this reaction is:\n\nKf = [ [Cu(NH3)4]2+ ] / ([Cu2+] [NH3]^4)\n\nGiven the formation constant Kf = 2.1 x 10^13, and the initial concentrations of Cu2+ and NH3 as 0.1 M and 0.2 M, respectively, we can set up the ICE table:\n\n               Cu2+   +  4NH3   <=>  [Cu(NH3)4]2+\nInitial (M)     0.1          0.2                0\nChange (M)     -x          -4x                +x\nEquilibrium (M) 0.1-x      0.2-4x            x\n\nNow, we can substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the Kf expression:\n\n2.1 x 10^13 = (x) / ((0.1-x)(0.2-4x)^4)\n\nSince Kf is very large, we can assume that x is small compared to 0.1 and 0.2, so we can simplify the expression:\n\n2.1 x 10^13 = (x) / ((0.1)(0.2)^4)\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nx = (2.1 x 10^13) * (0.1) * (0.2)^4\nx â‰ˆ 0.0672 M\n\nTherefore, the maximum concentration of the complex ion [Cu(NH3)4]2+ that can be formed when 0.1 M CuSO4 and 0.2 M NH3 are mixed together in a 1 L solution at room temperature is approximately 0.0672 M."
