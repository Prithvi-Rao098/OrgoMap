    "message_2": "When copper sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO4·5H2O) undergoes a decomposition reaction, it loses water molecules and forms anhydrous copper sulfate (CuSO4) and water (H2O). This process is called dehydration. The balanced chemical equation for this decomposition reaction is:\n\nCuSO4·5H2O(s) → CuSO4(s) + 5H2O(g)\n\nIn this reaction, one mole of copper sulfate pentahydrate (blue crystals) is heated, which results in the formation of one mole of anhydrous copper sulfate (white powder) and five moles of water in the form of steam. The color change from blue to white is due to the loss of water molecules from the crystal structure of copper sulfate pentahydrate."
