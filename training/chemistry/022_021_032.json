If the equilibrium constant at a certain temperature is 4.5 x 10^-5, what is the concentration of nitrogen monoxide at equilibrium if the initial concentrations of nitrogen gas and oxygen gas were 0.4 M and 0.6 M, respectively?",
    "message_2": "The balanced chemical equation for the reaction between nitrogen gas (N₂) and oxygen gas (O₂) to form nitrogen monoxide (NO) is:\n\nN₂(g) + O₂(g) ⇌ 2NO(g)\n\nThe equilibrium constant expression (Kc) for this reaction is:\n\nKc = [NO]^2 / ([N₂] * [O₂])\n\nGiven that the equilibrium constant (Kc) at a certain temperature is 4.5 x 10^-5, and the initial concentrations of nitrogen gas (N₂) and oxygen gas (O₂) are 0.4 M and 0.6 M, respectively, we can find the concentration of nitrogen monoxide (NO) at equilibrium.\n\nLet x be the change in concentration of N₂ and O₂ at equilibrium. Then, the change in concentration of NO will be 2x. The equilibrium concentrations will be:\n\n[N₂] = 0.4 - x\n[O₂] = 0.6 - x\n[NO] = 2x\n\nNow, we can substitute these equilibrium concentrations into the Kc expression:\n\n4.5 x 10^-5 = (2x)^2 / ((0.4 - x) * (0.6 - x))\n\nTo solve for x, we can use the quadratic formula or make an assumption that x is very small compared to the initial concentrations (since Kc is very small). In this case, we can approximate:\n\n4.5 x 10^-5 ≈ (2x)^2 / (0.4 * 0.6)\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx ≈ sqrt((4.5 x 10^-5) * (0.4 * 0.6) / 4)\nx ≈ 0.00164\n\nSince x is indeed very small compared to the initial concentrations, our assumption is valid. The concentration of nitrogen monoxide (NO) at equilibrium is:\n\n[NO] = 2x = 2 * 0.00164 ≈ 0.00328 M"
