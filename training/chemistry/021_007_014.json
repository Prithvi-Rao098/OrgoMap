    "message_2": "To calculate the formal charge of the nitrogen atom in HCN, we can use the following formula:\n\nFormal charge = (Valence electrons of the atom) - (Non-bonding electrons) - 0.5 * (Bonding electrons)\n\nIn HCN, the nitrogen atom is bonded to the carbon atom with a triple bond. Nitrogen has 5 valence electrons, and since it forms a triple bond with carbon, it has 6 bonding electrons (3 pairs) and no non-bonding electrons.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nFormal charge of N = (5) - (0) - 0.5 * (6)\nFormal charge of N = 5 - 0 - 3\nFormal charge of N = 2\n\nTherefore, the formal charge of the nitrogen atom in HCN is +2."
