    "message_2": "When sodium chloride (NaCl) is treated with silver nitrate (AgNO3), a double displacement reaction occurs, resulting in the formation of sodium nitrate (NaNO3) and silver chloride (AgCl). The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nNaCl(aq) + AgNO3(aq) â†’ NaNO3(aq) + AgCl(s)\n\nA precipitate will form in this reaction, as silver chloride (AgCl) is insoluble in water and will precipitate out as a solid."
