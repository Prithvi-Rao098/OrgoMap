    "message_2": "To calculate the pH of a 0.1 M solution of nitric acid (HNO3), we need to first determine the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in the solution. Since nitric acid is a strong acid, it will completely ionize in water, meaning that the concentration of H+ ions will be equal to the concentration of the nitric acid.\n\nIn this case, the concentration of H+ ions is 0.1 M. To find the pH, we can use the pH formula:\n\npH = -log10[H+]\n\nwhere [H+] is the concentration of hydrogen ions in moles per liter (M).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\npH = -log10(0.1)\npH = -(-1)\npH = 1\n\nSo, the pH of a 0.1 M solution of nitric acid (HNO3) is 1, assuming complete ionization."
