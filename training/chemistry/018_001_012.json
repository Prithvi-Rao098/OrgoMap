    "message_2": "To determine the rate law for the reaction, we need to find the order of the reaction with respect to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and iodide ions (I-). We can do this by comparing the initial rates and concentrations of the reactants in the given experiments.\n\nFirst, let's compare experiments 1 and 2 to determine the order with respect to H2O2:\n\nIn experiment 1:\n[H2O2] = 0.050 M\nInitial rate = 2.5x10^-4 M/s\n\nIn experiment 2:\n[H2O2] = 0.100 M\nInitial rate = 1.0x10^-3 M/s\n\nThe concentration of H2O2 doubles from experiment 1 to experiment 2, and the initial rate quadruples (1.0x10^-3 / 2.5x10^-4 = 4). This indicates that the reaction is second order with respect to H2O2.\n\nNow, let's compare experiments 2 and 3 to determine the order with respect to I-:\n\nIn experiment 2:\n[I-] = 0.100 M\nInitial rate = 1.0x10^-3 M/s\n\nIn experiment 3:\n[I-] = 0.200 M\nInitial rate = 2.0x10^-3 M/s\n\nThe concentration of I- doubles from experiment 2 to experiment 3, and the initial rate doubles as well (2.0x10^-3 / 1.0x10^-3 = 2). This indicates that the reaction is first order with respect to I-.\n\nNow that we know the reaction is second order with respect to H2O2 and first order with respect to I-, we can write the rate law:\n\nRate = k [H2O2]^2 [I-]^1\n\nOr simply:\n\nRate = k [H2O2]^2 [I-]"
