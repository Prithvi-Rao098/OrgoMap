    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic moment of FeCl3, we need to first find the number of unpaired electrons in the Fe(III) ion. FeCl3 contains an Fe(III) ion, which means that the iron atom has lost 3 electrons.\n\nThe electronic configuration of an iron atom (Fe) is [Ar] 3d^6 4s^2. When it loses 3 electrons to form Fe(III), the electronic configuration becomes [Ar] 3d^5. In this configuration, there are 5 unpaired electrons in the 3d orbitals.\n\nThe magnetic moment (μ) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nμ = √(n(n+2)) μ_B\n\nwhere n is the number of unpaired electrons, and μ_B is the Bohr magneton (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T).\n\nFor Fe(III) with 5 unpaired electrons:\n\nμ = √(5(5+2)) μ_B\nμ = √(5(7)) μ_B\nμ = √(35) μ_B\n\nThe magnetic moment of FeCl3 is approximately √(35) μ_B or 5.92 μ_B."
