    "message_2": "To calculate the surface area of the powdered activated carbon sample, we can use the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory, which relates the amount of gas adsorbed to the surface area of the adsorbent. In this case, we are given the amount of nitrogen gas adsorbed and the cross-sectional area of a nitrogen molecule.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the volume of nitrogen gas adsorbed (25.6 mL/g) to moles. We can do this using the ideal gas law:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nwhere P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is temperature.\n\nAssuming standard pressure (1 atm) and the given temperature of -196°C (77 K), we can solve for n:\n\n(1 atm) * (25.6 mL/g) = n * (0.0821 L atm/mol K) * (77 K)\n\nRearranging and solving for n:\n\nn = (1 atm * 25.6 mL/g) / (0.0821 L atm/mol K * 77 K) = 0.0102 mol/g\n\nNow, we can calculate the surface area of the activated carbon sample using the cross-sectional area of a nitrogen molecule (16.2 Å²) and the number of moles of nitrogen adsorbed:\n\nSurface area = (0.0102 mol/g) * (6.022 x 10^23 molecules/mol) * (16.2 Å²/molecule)\n\nSurface area = 1.00 x 10^22 Å²/g\n\nTo convert the surface area to a more common unit, such as m²/g, we can use the conversion factor:\n\n1 Å² = 1 x 10^-20 m²\n\nSurface area = (1.00 x 10^22 Å²/g) * (1 x 10^-20 m²/Å²) = 1000 m²/g\n\nSo, the surface area of the powdered activated carbon sample is approximately 1000 m²/g."
