    "message_2": "Methanol (CH3OH) and ethanol (C2H5OH) are both alcohols, but they have some differences in their physical and chemical properties that impact their uses as solvents, fuels, and pharmaceuticals.\n\n1. Molecular structure: Methanol has one carbon atom, while ethanol has two carbon atoms in its structure. This difference in molecular size affects their physical and chemical properties.\n\n2. Boiling point: Methanol has a boiling point of 64.7째C (148.5째F), while ethanol has a higher boiling point of 78.4째C (173.1째F). This difference in boiling points is due to the larger molecular size and stronger van der Waals forces in ethanol.\n\n3. Polarity: Both methanol and ethanol are polar molecules due to the presence of the hydroxyl (-OH) group. However, ethanol is slightly less polar than methanol due to the presence of an additional methyl group, which is non-polar.\n\n4. Solubility: Both methanol and ethanol are miscible with water and many organic solvents due to their polar nature. However, ethanol is slightly less soluble in water than methanol.\n\n5. Flammability: Both methanol and ethanol are flammable, but methanol burns with a less visible flame, making it more dangerous.\n\n6. Toxicity: Methanol is more toxic than ethanol. Ingestion of methanol can lead to severe poisoning, causing symptoms such as headache, dizziness, nausea, and even blindness or death. Ethanol, on the other hand, is the type of alcohol found in alcoholic beverages and is less toxic in moderate amounts.\n\nImpact on uses:\n\nSolvents: Both methanol and ethanol are used as solvents in various industries due to their polar nature and ability to dissolve a wide range of compounds. However, ethanol is preferred in some cases due to its lower toxicity and better solubility in water.\n\nFuels: Both methanol and ethanol can be used as alternative fuels. Ethanol is commonly used as a gasoline additive (E10, E15, or E85) to reduce emissions and increase octane rating. Methanol is used as a fuel in some racing cars and as a feedstock for producing other chemicals. However, ethanol is generally preferred as a fuel due to its higher energy content, lower toxicity, and compatibility with existing engines.\n\nPharmaceuticals: Ethanol is widely used in the pharmaceutical industry as a solvent, disinfectant, and preservative. It is also used as an antidote for methanol poisoning. Methanol, due to its higher toxicity, is not used in pharmaceutical applications where human exposure is possible.\n\nIn summary, the differences in physical and chemical properties between methanol and ethanol, such as molecular size, boiling point, polarity, solubility, flammability, and toxicity, impact their uses as solvents, fuels, and pharmaceuticals. Ethanol is generally preferred in most applications due to its lower toxicity and better compatibility with existing systems."
