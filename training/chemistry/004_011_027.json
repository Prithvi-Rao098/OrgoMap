    "message_1": "What is the structure of compound X based on its proton NMR spectrum, which shows a singlet at 1.2 ppm with an integration of 3, a doublet at 2.5 ppm with an integration of 2, and a quartet at 3.7 ppm with an integration of 1?",
    "message_2": "Based on the given proton NMR spectrum, we can deduce the following information:\n\n1. A singlet at 1.2 ppm with an integration of 3 suggests that there are three equivalent protons in a methyl group (CH3) that are not adjacent to any other protons.\n\n2. A doublet at 2.5 ppm with an integration of 2 indicates that there are two equivalent protons in a methylene group (CH2) that is adjacent to another proton, as the splitting pattern follows the n+1 rule (where n is the number of adjacent protons).\n\n3. A quartet at 3.7 ppm with an integration of 1 implies that there is a single proton adjacent to the methylene group (CH2) mentioned earlier, as it is split into a quartet due to the three adjacent protons in the CH2 group.\n\nBased on this information, the structure of compound X is likely to be isopropyl alcohol (also known as 2-propanol or isopropanol), which has the following structure:\n\nCH3-CH(OH)-CH3"
