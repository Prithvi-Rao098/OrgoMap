    "message_2": "To determine the functional groups present in compound X, I would need the chemical structure or the name of the compound. However, I can provide general information about identifying functional groups using infrared (IR) spectroscopy.\n\nInfrared spectroscopy is a powerful technique for identifying functional groups in organic compounds. It works by measuring the absorption of infrared light by the compound, which causes vibrations in the chemical bonds. Different functional groups have characteristic absorption bands, which can be used to identify them.\n\nSome common functional groups and their characteristic IR absorption bands include:\n\n1. Hydroxyl group (OH): Broad absorption around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹.\n2. Carbonyl group (C=O): Strong, sharp absorption around 1650-1750 cm⁻¹.\n3. Amine group (NH): Medium to strong absorption around 3300-3500 cm⁻¹.\n4. Alkene group (C=C): Medium absorption around 1620-1680 cm⁻¹.\n5. Alkyne group (C≡C): Medium to strong absorption around 2100-2260 cm⁻¹.\n6. Aromatic ring (C=C): Multiple absorptions around 1600-1650 cm⁻¹ and 1400-1600 cm⁻¹.\n7. Nitrile group (C≡N): Medium to strong absorption around 2210-2260 cm⁻¹.\n8. Ether group (C-O): Medium absorption around 1000-1300 cm⁻¹.\n\nPlease provide the chemical structure or the name of compound X, and I can help you identify the specific functional groups present in it and whether they can be identified using infrared spectroscopy."
