    "message_2": "To determine the quantity of copper ions present in a sample of copper sulfate using coulometry, you need to know the mass of the sample, the molar mass of copper sulfate, and the Faraday constant. Here's how to calculate it:\n\n1. Determine the mass of the copper sulfate sample (in grams).\n2. Calculate the moles of copper sulfate in the sample by dividing the mass of the sample by the molar mass of copper sulfate (CuSO4). The molar mass of CuSO4 is approximately 159.61 g/mol.\n\n   Moles of CuSO4 = (mass of sample) / (molar mass of CuSO4)\n\n3. Since there is one copper ion (Cu²⁺) per molecule of copper sulfate, the moles of copper ions are equal to the moles of copper sulfate.\n\n4. Calculate the total charge passed through the solution during the coulometric analysis. This can be done by multiplying the current (in amperes) by the time (in seconds) the current was applied.\n\n   Total charge (coulombs) = current (amperes) × time (seconds)\n\n5. Use the Faraday constant (F) to determine the moles of copper ions reduced. The Faraday constant is approximately 96,485 C/mol.\n\n   Moles of Cu²⁺ reduced = (total charge) / (2 × F)\n\n   Note that the factor of 2 is used because copper ions have a charge of +2 (Cu²⁺).\n\n6. Compare the moles of Cu²⁺ reduced to the moles of copper sulfate in the sample. If the moles of Cu²⁺ reduced are equal to or less than the moles of copper sulfate, then all the copper ions in the sample have been reduced. If the moles of Cu²⁺ reduced are greater than the moles of copper sulfate, then there are excess copper ions in the sample.\n\n7. Calculate the mass of copper ions present in the sample by multiplying the moles of Cu²⁺ by the molar mass of copper (approximately 63.55 g/mol).\n\n   Mass of Cu²⁺ = (moles of Cu²⁺) × (molar mass of Cu)\n\nThis will give you the quantity of copper ions present in the sample of copper sulfate."
