    "message_2": "To calculate the polarization potential of the electrochemical cell, we need to determine the overpotential for both the zinc and copper electrodes. The overpotential (η) can be calculated using the Tafel equation:\n\nη = (2.303 * R * T) / (n * F) * log10(i / i₀)\n\nwhere R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin (25°C = 298.15 K), n is the number of electrons transferred in the redox reaction (for both Zn and Cu, n = 2), F is the Faraday constant (96485 C/mol), i is the current density, and i₀ is the exchange current density.\n\nFor the zinc electrode, the exchange current density i₀ is given as 10^-6 A/cm². We can assume that the current density i is equal to the exchange current density since the cell is at equilibrium. Therefore, the overpotential for the zinc electrode can be calculated as:\n\nη_Zn = (2.303 * 8.314 * 298.15) / (2 * 96485) * log10(10^-6 / 10^-6)\nη_Zn = 0 V\n\nFor the copper electrode, the exchange current density i₀ is given as 10^-5 A/cm². Similarly, we can assume that the current density i is equal to the exchange current density. Therefore, the overpotential for the copper electrode can be calculated as:\n\nη_Cu = (2.303 * 8.314 * 298.15) / (2 * 96485) * log10(10^-5 / 10^-5)\nη_Cu = 0 V\n\nSince both overpotentials are 0 V, the polarization potential of the electrochemical cell is equal to the corrosion potential:\n\nPolarization potential = Corrosion potential = -0.76 V"
