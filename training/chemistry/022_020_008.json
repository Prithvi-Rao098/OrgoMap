    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question for a chemistry student to solve:\n\nWhat is the activation energy for the following chemical reaction given that the rate of reaction doubles when the temperature is increased from 25°C to 35°C?\n\n2HCl(aq) + Na2S2O3(aq) → 2NaCl(aq) + SO2(g) + S(s) + H2O(l)\n\nAssume that the frequency factor remains constant.",
    "message_2": "To find the activation energy (Ea) for the given reaction, we can use the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk = A * exp(-Ea / (R * T))\n\nwhere k is the rate constant, A is the frequency factor, Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nSince the rate of reaction doubles when the temperature is increased from 25°C to 35°C, we can set up two equations using the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk1 = A * exp(-Ea / (R * T1))\nk2 = A * exp(-Ea / (R * T2))\n\nwhere k1 and k2 are the rate constants at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively. We are given that k2 = 2 * k1.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin:\n\nT1 = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\nT2 = 35°C + 273.15 = 308.15 K\n\nNow, we can set up the ratio of the rate constants:\n\nk2 / k1 = (A * exp(-Ea / (R * T2))) / (A * exp(-Ea / (R * T1)))\n\nSince k2 = 2 * k1:\n\n2 = exp(-Ea / (R * T1)) / exp(-Ea / (R * T2))\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(2) = (-Ea / (R * T1)) - (-Ea / (R * T2))\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for Ea:\n\nEa = R * (T1 * T2) * ln(2) / (T2 - T1)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nEa = 8.314 J/mol·K * (298.15 K * 308.15 K) * ln(2) / (308.15 K - 298.15 K)\n\nEa ≈ 5313.6 J/mol\n\nThe activation energy for the given reaction is approximately 5313.6 J/mol."
