    "message_1": "A chemistry student was given a sample of a white crystalline substance, suspected to be a mixture of sodium chloride (NaCl) and potassium chloride (KCl). The student performed an analysis and found that the sample contained 64% chlorine by mass. Calculate the mass percentage of sodium chloride and potassium chloride present in the mixture.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the given information to set up a system of equations and solve for the mass percentages of sodium chloride (NaCl) and potassium chloride (KCl) in the mixture.\n\nLet x be the mass percentage of NaCl and y be the mass percentage of KCl in the mixture. Since the mixture is composed of only these two compounds, we can write the first equation as:\n\nx + y = 100  (1)\n\nNext, we need to consider the mass percentage of chlorine in each compound. The molar mass of NaCl is 58.44 g/mol (22.99 g/mol for Na and 35.45 g/mol for Cl), and the molar mass of KCl is 74.55 g/mol (39.10 g/mol for K and 35.45 g/mol for Cl). The mass percentage of chlorine in NaCl is (35.45/58.44) * 100 = 60.66%, and the mass percentage of chlorine in KCl is (35.45/74.55) * 100 = 47.53%.\n\nUsing this information, we can write the second equation based on the given mass percentage of chlorine in the mixture (64%):\n\n0.6066x + 0.4753y = 64  (2)\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two variables. We can solve this system using the substitution or elimination method. We'll use the elimination method here. First, we'll solve equation (1) for y:\n\ny = 100 - x\n\nNext, substitute this expression for y in equation (2):\n\n0.6066x + 0.4753(100 - x) = 64\n\nNow solve for x:\n\n0.6066x + 47.53 - 0.4753x = 64\n0.1313x = 16.47\nx â‰ˆ 125.5\n\nSince x represents the mass percentage of NaCl, we have approximately 125.5% NaCl in the mixture. However, this result is not physically possible, as mass percentages must be between 0% and 100%. There may have been an error in the given information or the analysis performed by the student. Please double-check the provided data and try again."
