    "message_2": "Primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols are classified based on the carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group (-OH). The difference between these three types of alcohols lies in the number of carbon atoms directly attached to the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group.\n\n1. Primary alcohols (1°): In primary alcohols, the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group is bonded to only one other carbon atom and two hydrogen atoms. The general formula for primary alcohols is RCH2OH, where R represents an alkyl group.\n\nExample: Ethanol (CH3CH2OH) is a primary alcohol. The carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group is bonded to one other carbon atom (CH3) and two hydrogen atoms.\n\n2. Secondary alcohols (2°): In secondary alcohols, the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group is bonded to two other carbon atoms and one hydrogen atom. The general formula for secondary alcohols is R2CHOH, where R represents an alkyl group.\n\nExample: Isopropanol (CH3CHOHCH3) is a secondary alcohol. The carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group is bonded to two other carbon atoms (both CH3) and one hydrogen atom.\n\n3. Tertiary alcohols (3°): In tertiary alcohols, the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group is bonded to three other carbon atoms and no hydrogen atoms. The general formula for tertiary alcohols is R3COH, where R represents an alkyl group.\n\nExample: Tert-butanol (t-BuOH, or (CH3)3COH) is a tertiary alcohol. The carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group is bonded to three other carbon atoms (all CH3) and no hydrogen atoms.\n\nProperties and Reactivity:\n\nPrimary alcohols are generally more reactive than secondary and tertiary alcohols due to the presence of more hydrogen atoms bonded to the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group. This makes primary alcohols more susceptible to oxidation reactions, which can convert them into aldehydes and then carboxylic acids.\n\nSecondary alcohols can also undergo oxidation reactions, but they are less reactive than primary alcohols. When oxidized, secondary alcohols form ketones.\n\nTertiary alcohols are the least reactive among the three types of alcohols, as they cannot be easily oxidized due to the absence of hydrogen atoms bonded to the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group.\n\nIn summary, the reactivity of alcohols decreases in the following order: primary > secondary > tertiary. This difference in reactivity can be determined by examining their chemical structure and the number of carbon atoms bonded to the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group."
