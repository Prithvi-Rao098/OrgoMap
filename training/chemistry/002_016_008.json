    "message_2": "To calculate the standard reaction entropy, we can use the equation:\n\nΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°\n\nWhere ΔG° is the standard Gibbs free energy change, ΔH° is the standard enthalpy change, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ΔS° is the standard entropy change.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) for the reaction. Since the reaction is balanced and the standard state is defined, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG° = ΔGf°(products) - ΔGf°(reactants)\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\nΔG° = ΔGf°(Fe2O3) - [2ΔGf°(Fe) + 3/2ΔGf°(O2)]\n\nThe standard Gibbs free energy of formation (ΔGf°) for elements in their standard state is zero. Therefore, ΔGf°(Fe) = 0 and ΔGf°(O2) = 0. The ΔGf°(Fe2O3) = -740.5 kJ/mol (from standard thermodynamic tables). Substituting these values into the equation:\n\nΔG° = -740.5 kJ/mol - [2(0) + 3/2(0)]\nΔG° = -740.5 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can use the equation ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS° to find the standard reaction entropy (ΔS°). We are given the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) as -824.2 kJ/mol and the temperature (T) as 298 K. Rearranging the equation to solve for ΔS°:\n\nΔS° = (ΔH° - ΔG°) / T\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nΔS° = (-824.2 kJ/mol + 740.5 kJ/mol) / 298 K\nΔS° = (-83.7 kJ/mol) / 298 K\nΔS° = -0.281 kJ/(mol·K)\n\nThe standard reaction entropy for the given reaction is -0.281 kJ/(mol·K)."
