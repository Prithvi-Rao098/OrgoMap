    "message_2": "The enthalpy of ionization for sodium ion (Na+) refers to the energy required to remove one electron from a neutral sodium atom (Na) to form a sodium ion (Na+). In this case, we are only concerned with the first ionization energy, as it represents the energy required to remove the first electron from the sodium atom.\n\nThe first ionization energy of sodium (Na) is given as 495.8 kJ/mol. This value represents the enthalpy of ionization for sodium ion (Na+), as it is the energy required to remove one electron from a neutral sodium atom to form a sodium ion.\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy of ionization for sodium ion (Na+) is 495.8 kJ/mol."
