    "message_1": "What is the balanced chemical equation for the preparation of 2,4-dinitrophenol from phenol and nitric acid? Calculate the theoretical yield of 2,4-dinitrophenol if 10 grams of phenol and 20 mL of 68% nitric acid are used in the reaction. What is the percentage yield if only 5 grams of 2,4-dinitrophenol are obtained from the reaction?",
    "message_2": "To prepare 2,4-dinitrophenol from phenol and nitric acid, the balanced chemical equation is:\n\nC6H5OH + 2 HNO3 â†’ C6H3(NO2)2OH + 2 H2O\n\nNow, let's calculate the theoretical yield of 2,4-dinitrophenol.\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of phenol and nitric acid.\n\nMoles of phenol = mass / molar mass\nMoles of phenol = 10 g / (94.11 g/mol) = 0.106 mol\n\nFor nitric acid, we have 20 mL of 68% nitric acid. This means that there are 13.6 g of nitric acid in the solution (20 mL * 0.68 g/mL).\n\nMoles of nitric acid = mass / molar mass\nMoles of nitric acid = 13.6 g / (63.01 g/mol) = 0.216 mol\n\nNow, we need to determine the limiting reactant. The stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:2, meaning that 1 mole of phenol reacts with 2 moles of nitric acid.\n\nMoles of nitric acid required for 0.106 mol of phenol = 0.106 mol * 2 = 0.212 mol\n\nSince we have 0.216 mol of nitric acid, which is more than the required 0.212 mol, phenol is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow, let's calculate the theoretical yield of 2,4-dinitrophenol.\n\nMoles of 2,4-dinitrophenol = moles of phenol (since the stoichiometry is 1:1)\nMoles of 2,4-dinitrophenol = 0.106 mol\n\nMass of 2,4-dinitrophenol = moles * molar mass\nMass of 2,4-dinitrophenol = 0.106 mol * (184.11 g/mol) = 19.52 g\n\nThe theoretical yield of 2,4-dinitrophenol is 19.52 g.\n\nNow, let's calculate the percentage yield.\n\nPercentage yield = (actual yield / theoretical yield) * 100\nPercentage yield = (5 g / 19.52 g) * 100 = 25.62%\n\nThe percentage yield of 2,4-dinitrophenol in this reaction is 25.62%."
