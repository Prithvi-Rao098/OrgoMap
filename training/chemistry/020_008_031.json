    "message_1": "What is the effect of increasing the volume of a reaction vessel containing a mixture of 0.10 M nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and 0.08 M dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4)? The equilibrium constant (Kp) for the reaction is 0.20 atm.",
    "message_2": "The reaction between nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4) is as follows:\n\n2 NO2 <=> N2O4\n\nWhen the volume of the reaction vessel is increased, the pressure inside the vessel decreases. According to Le Chatelier's principle, the system will shift to counteract the change in pressure. In this case, the system will shift to the side with more moles of gas to increase the pressure.\n\nIn the reaction, there are 2 moles of NO2 on the left side and 1 mole of N2O4 on the right side. Therefore, when the volume is increased, the reaction will shift to the left, favoring the formation of NO2. This means that the concentration of NO2 will increase, while the concentration of N2O4 will decrease.\n\nHowever, the equilibrium constant (Kp) remains constant at 0.20 atm. The system will eventually reach a new equilibrium state with the adjusted concentrations of NO2 and N2O4."
