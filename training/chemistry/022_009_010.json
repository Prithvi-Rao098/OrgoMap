    "message_2": "When aqueous solutions of barium chloride (BaCl2) and sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) are mixed, a double displacement reaction occurs, resulting in the formation of barium sulfate (BaSO4) and sodium chloride (NaCl). Barium sulfate is insoluble in water and will precipitate out as a solid, while sodium chloride remains soluble in water.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nBaCl2(aq) + Na2SO4(aq) â†’ BaSO4(s) + 2NaCl(aq)\n\nThe products formed are barium sulfate (BaSO4) as a solid precipitate and sodium chloride (NaCl) as an aqueous solution."
