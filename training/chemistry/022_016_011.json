    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the bond dissociation energies given. The enthalpy change for the reaction can be found using the following equation:\n\nΔH = Σ (bond dissociation energies of bonds broken) - Σ (bond dissociation energies of bonds formed)\n\nIn this reaction, the bonds broken are:\n- 2 H-Br bonds in 2HBr\n- 1 Cl-Cl bond in Cl2\n\nThe bonds formed are:\n- 2 H-Cl bonds in 2HCl\n- 1 Br-Br bond in Br2\n\nNow, we can plug in the bond dissociation energies into the equation:\n\nΔH = [(2 × 366 kJ/mol) + (1 × 242 kJ/mol)] - [(2 × 431 kJ/mol) + (1 × 193 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH = [(732 kJ/mol) + (242 kJ/mol)] - [(862 kJ/mol) + (193 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH = (974 kJ/mol) - (1055 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH = -81 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change for the reaction is -81 kJ/mol."
