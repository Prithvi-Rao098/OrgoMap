    "message_2": "The coordination number of a transition metal complex refers to the number of ligands directly bonded to the central metal ion. In the given complex [Co(NH3)4Cl2]Cl, the central metal ion is cobalt (Co).\n\nThere are 4 ammonia (NH3) ligands and 2 chloride (Cl) ligands directly bonded to the cobalt ion. Therefore, the coordination number of this complex is 4 + 2 = 6."
