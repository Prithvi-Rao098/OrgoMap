    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction, we need to find the difference between the bond enthalpies of the reactants and the products.\n\nReactants:\n2 moles of H-H bonds: 2 × 436 kJ/mol = 872 kJ/mol\n1 mole of O=O bond: 1 × 495 kJ/mol = 495 kJ/mol\nTotal bond enthalpy of reactants: 872 + 495 = 1367 kJ/mol\n\nProducts:\n4 moles of H-O bonds (since there are 2 H-O bonds in each H2O molecule and we have 2 H2O molecules): 4 × 464 kJ/mol = 1856 kJ/mol\nTotal bond enthalpy of products: 1856 kJ/mol\n\nEnthalpy change (ΔH) = Bond enthalpy of products - Bond enthalpy of reactants\nΔH = 1856 kJ/mol - 1367 kJ/mol = 489 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change for the reaction is 489 kJ/mol."
