    "message_2": "The solubility of AgCl in water is affected by the common ion effect due to the presence of NaCl. The common ion effect states that the solubility of a sparingly soluble salt is decreased in the presence of a common ion.\n\nAgCl is a sparingly soluble salt that dissociates in water as follows:\n\nAgCl(s) ⇌ Ag⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq)\n\nThe solubility product constant (Ksp) for AgCl is 1.77 x 10⁻¹⁰ at 25°C.\n\nKsp = [Ag⁺][Cl⁻]\n\nWhen NaCl is added to the solution, it dissociates completely into Na⁺ and Cl⁻ ions:\n\nNaCl(s) → Na⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq)\n\nSince the concentration of Cl⁻ ions increases due to the addition of NaCl, the equilibrium of AgCl shifts to the left, according to Le Chatelier's principle, to counteract the change. This results in a decrease in the solubility of AgCl.\n\nTo calculate the impact of increasing the concentration of NaCl on the solubility of AgCl, let's assume we have a 0.1 M NaCl solution.\n\nThe dissociation of NaCl will result in [Cl⁻] = 0.1 M. Now, let's find the concentration of Ag⁺ ions at equilibrium:\n\nKsp = [Ag⁺][Cl⁻] = [Ag⁺](0.1)\n\n[Ag⁺] = Ksp / [Cl⁻] = (1.77 x 10⁻¹⁰) / 0.1 = 1.77 x 10⁻¹¹ M\n\nThe solubility of AgCl in pure water is approximately 1.3 x 10⁻⁵ M. In the presence of 0.1 M NaCl, the solubility of AgCl decreases to 1.77 x 10⁻¹¹ M. This demonstrates that increasing the concentration of NaCl significantly reduces the solubility of AgCl in water."
