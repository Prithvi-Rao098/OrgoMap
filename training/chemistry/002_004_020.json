    "message_2": "The ionization constant (Ka) given is not relevant for hydrochloric acid, as HCl is a strong acid and dissociates completely in water. Therefore, we do not need to use the ionization constant to calculate the pH of the solution.\n\nTo find the pH of a 0.1 M HCl solution, we can use the formula:\n\npH = -log10[H+]\n\nSince HCl is a strong acid and dissociates completely, the concentration of H+ ions in the solution will be equal to the concentration of HCl, which is 0.1 M.\n\npH = -log10(0.1)\npH = 1\n\nThe pH of a 0.1 M solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl) is 1."
