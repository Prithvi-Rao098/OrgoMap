    "message_2": "To calculate the energy required to melt 50 grams of ice at 0 °C to water at the same temperature, we need to use the enthalpy of fusion of water, which is 6.01 kJ/mol.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of ice to moles. The molar mass of water is 18.015 g/mol.\n\nMoles of ice = (50 g) / (18.015 g/mol) = 2.776 moles\n\nNow, we can use the enthalpy of fusion to calculate the energy required to melt the ice:\n\nEnergy required = (moles of ice) × (enthalpy of fusion)\nEnergy required = (2.776 moles) × (6.01 kJ/mol) = 16.681 kJ\n\nTherefore, the amount of energy required to melt 50 grams of ice at 0 °C to water at the same temperature is 16.681 kJ."
