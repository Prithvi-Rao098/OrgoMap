    "message_1": "What is the final temperature when a 56 g piece of copper at 95 °C is placed in 125 mL of water at 21 °C? The specific heat of copper is 0.385 J/g °C, and the specific heat of water is 4.18 J/g °C. Assume no heat is lost to the surroundings.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for heat transfer:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat transferred, m is the mass, c is the specific heat, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nSince no heat is lost to the surroundings, the heat gained by the water will be equal to the heat lost by the copper. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\nmcΔT(copper) = mcΔT(water)\n\nLet's denote the final temperature as Tf. Then, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nm(copper)c(copper)(Tf - T(copper)) = m(water)c(water)(Tf - T(water))\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\n56 g * 0.385 J/g °C * (Tf - 95 °C) = 125 mL * 1 g/mL * 4.18 J/g °C * (Tf - 21 °C)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n21.56 (Tf - 95) = 522.5 (Tf - 21)\n\nExpand the equation:\n\n21.56Tf - 2048.2 = 522.5Tf - 10972.5\n\nNow, move the terms with Tf to one side and the constants to the other side:\n\n522.5Tf - 21.56Tf = 10972.5 + 2048.2\n\nCombine the terms:\n\n500.94Tf = 13020.7\n\nNow, divide by 500.94 to find the final temperature:\n\nTf = 13020.7 / 500.94\n\nTf ≈ 25.98 °C\n\nThe final temperature when a 56 g piece of copper at 95 °C is placed in 125 mL of water at 21 °C is approximately 25.98 °C."
