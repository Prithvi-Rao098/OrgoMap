    "message_2": "To synthesize 2-butyne from 1-bromobutane, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Formation of 1-butyne from 1-bromobutane via double dehydrohalogenation.\n2. Conversion of 1-butyne to 2-butyne using isomerization.\n\nStep 1: Formation of 1-butyne from 1-bromobutane\n1-bromobutane can be converted to 1-butyne through a double dehydrohalogenation reaction. This involves two E2 elimination reactions.\n\nReaction 1: First E2 elimination\nReagents: NaNH2 (sodium amide) in liquid ammonia (NH3)\nMechanism: The strong base NaNH2 abstracts a proton from the β-carbon, and the electrons from the C-H bond form a double bond with the α-carbon, while the leaving group (Br-) departs.\n\n1-bromobutane + NaNH2 -> 1-butyne + NaBr + NH3\n\nReaction 2: Second E2 elimination\nReagents: NaNH2 in liquid ammonia (NH3)\nMechanism: The strong base NaNH2 abstracts a proton from the β-carbon, and the electrons from the C-H bond form a triple bond with the α-carbon, while the leaving group (Br-) departs.\n\n1-butyne + NaNH2 -> 1-butyne + NaBr + NH3\n\nStep 2: Conversion of 1-butyne to 2-butyne using isomerization\nReagents: H2SO4 (sulfuric acid) and HgSO4 (mercuric sulfate)\nMechanism: The reaction proceeds via a keto-enol tautomerization. The terminal alkyne proton is first abstracted by the acid, and the resulting carbocation is attacked by water. The intermediate enol then undergoes keto-enol tautomerization to form the more stable 2-butyne.\n\n1-butyne + H2SO4 + HgSO4 -> 2-butyne\n\nOverall synthesis pathway:\n1-bromobutane + 2 NaNH2 -> 1-butyne + 2 NaBr + 2 NH3\n1-butyne + H2SO4 + HgSO4 -> 2-butyne"
