    "message_2": "The synthesis of ibuprofen from 2-methylpropylbenzene and carbon dioxide can be achieved through the following steps:\n\n1. Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:\nReagents: 2-methylpropylbenzene, propionyl chloride, and aluminum chloride (AlCl3) as a catalyst.\nReaction conditions: Heat the mixture at 40-50°C for several hours.\nMechanism: The AlCl3 acts as a Lewis acid, activating the propionyl chloride by forming a complex with the carbonyl group. This generates an electrophilic acylium ion, which then reacts with the 2-methylpropylbenzene through an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. The product is a ketone with a 2-methylpropyl group attached to the benzene ring.\n\n2. Reduction of the ketone to an alcohol:\nReagents: Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) or lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4).\nReaction conditions: Add the reducing agent to the ketone in an anhydrous solvent (e.g., tetrahydrofuran or diethyl ether) at 0°C, then slowly warm to room temperature.\nMechanism: The hydride ion from the reducing agent attacks the carbonyl carbon, forming a new C-H bond and reducing the ketone to an alcohol.\n\n3. Formation of the carboxylic acid group:\nReagents: Carbon dioxide (CO2) and a base, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or potassium hydroxide (KOH).\nReaction conditions: Bubble CO2 through a solution of the alcohol and base in a solvent (e.g., water or alcohol) at room temperature.\nMechanism: The base deprotonates the alcohol, forming an alkoxide ion. The alkoxide ion then reacts with CO2, forming a carboxylate ion. The carboxylate ion can be protonated to form the carboxylic acid.\n\n4. Formation of the ibuprofen ester:\nReagents: Ethyl chloroformate (ClCOOEt) and a base, such as triethylamine (Et3N).\nReaction conditions: Add the reagents to a solution of the carboxylic acid in an anhydrous solvent (e.g., dichloromethane) at 0°C, then slowly warm to room temperature.\nMechanism: The base deprotonates the carboxylic acid, forming a carboxylate ion. The carboxylate ion reacts with ethyl chloroformate, forming an ester and releasing a chloride ion.\n\n5. Formation of the final ibuprofen product:\nReagents: Hydrazine (N2H4) and a base, such as potassium hydroxide (KOH).\nReaction conditions: Heat the mixture of the ester, hydrazine, and base in an alcohol solvent (e.g., ethanol) under reflux for several hours.\nMechanism: The hydrazine reacts with the ester, forming a hydrazone intermediate. The base then deprotonates the hydrazone, which undergoes a rearrangement to form the final ibuprofen product and regenerate the hydrazine."
