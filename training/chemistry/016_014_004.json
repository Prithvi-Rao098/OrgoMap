The molar heat capacity of iodine (s) is 54.44 J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹ and the molar heat capacity of iodine (g) is 36.57 J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹. The molar enthalpy of fusion of iodine is 15.52 kJ mol⁻¹.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the heat of sublimation for iodine, we need to consider the following steps:\n\n1. Heating solid iodine from -110°C to its melting point (113.7°C)\n2. Melting solid iodine to liquid iodine\n3. Heating liquid iodine from its melting point (113.7°C) to its boiling point (184°C)\n4. Vaporizing liquid iodine to gaseous iodine\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of moles of iodine:\nMolar mass of iodine (I2) = 253.8 g/mol\n25 g / 253.8 g/mol ≈ 0.0985 mol\n\nStep 1: Heating solid iodine from -110°C to its melting point (113.7°C)\nq1 = n * C(s) * ΔT\nq1 = 0.0985 mol * 54.44 J/mol*K * (113.7 - (-110))\nq1 ≈ 1209.6 J\n\nStep 2: Melting solid iodine to liquid iodine\nq2 = n * ΔHf\nq2 = 0.0985 mol * 15.52 kJ/mol * 1000 J/kJ\nq2 ≈ 1529.6 J\n\nStep 3: Heating liquid iodine from its melting point (113.7°C) to its boiling point (184°C) can be skipped because the heat capacity of liquid iodine is not given. \n\nStep 4: Vaporizing liquid iodine to gaseous iodine\nWe need to find the molar enthalpy of vaporization (ΔHvap) first. We can use the following equation:\n\nΔHsub = ΔHf + ΔHvap\n\nWe know the molar enthalpy of sublimation (ΔHsub) for iodine is approximately 62 kJ/mol. So,\n\nΔHvap = ΔHsub - ΔHf\nΔHvap = 62 kJ/mol - 15.52 kJ/mol\nΔHvap ≈ 46.48 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat required to vaporize liquid iodine:\n\nq4 = n * ΔHvap\nq4 = 0.0985 mol * 46.48 kJ/mol * 1000 J/kJ\nq4 ≈ 4574.2 J\n\nFinally, we can add up the heat required for all steps to find the total heat of sublimation:\n\nq_total = q1 + q2 + q4\nq_total = 1209.6 J + 1529.6 J + 4574.2 J\nq_total ≈ 7313.4 J\n\nTherefore, the heat of sublimation for 25 g of iodine is approximately 7313.4 J."
