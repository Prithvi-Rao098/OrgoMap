    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic moment of the octahedral [Co(NH3)6]2+ complex, we first need to find the oxidation state of the cobalt ion (Co) and its electron configuration.\n\nThe complex is [Co(NH3)6]2+, which means the cobalt ion has a +2 charge. Cobalt's atomic number is 27, and its ground state electron configuration is [Ar] 3d7 4s2. When it loses two electrons to form the Co2+ ion, its electron configuration becomes [Ar] 3d7.\n\nNow, we need to consider the crystal field theory for an octahedral complex. In an octahedral complex, the d orbitals split into two sets: the lower energy t2g orbitals (dxy, dyz, and dxz) and the higher energy eg orbitals (dz2 and dx2-y2). The energy difference between these two sets is called the crystal field splitting energy (Δo).\n\nIn the case of [Co(NH3)6]2+, the ligand (NH3) is a strong field ligand, which means it causes a large crystal field splitting energy. This leads to a low-spin complex, where the electrons will fill the lower energy t2g orbitals before populating the higher energy eg orbitals.\n\nWith 7 electrons in the 3d orbitals, the electron configuration for the Co2+ ion in the octahedral complex is:\n\nt2g^6 eg^1\n\nThere is one unpaired electron in the complex. The magnetic moment (μ) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nμ = √(n(n+2))\n\nwhere n is the number of unpaired electrons.\n\nFor the [Co(NH3)6]2+ complex, n = 1:\n\nμ = √(1(1+2))\nμ = √3\n\nThe magnetic moment of the octahedral [Co(NH3)6]2+ complex is √3 Bohr magnetons."
