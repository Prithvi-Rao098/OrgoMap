    "message_2": "When a strong acid like hydrochloric acid (HCl) is added to a solution containing a weak acid like acetic acid (CH3COOH), the ionization of the weak acid is suppressed. This is due to the common ion effect.\n\nIn the presence of a strong acid, the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in the solution increases significantly. Since the ionization of acetic acid involves the release of H+ ions, the equilibrium shifts to the left, according to Le Chatelier's principle, to counteract the increase in H+ ions. This results in a decrease in the ionization of acetic acid.\n\nThe reaction for the ionization of acetic acid is:\n\nCH3COOH ⇌ CH3COO- + H+\n\nWhen HCl is added to the solution, it dissociates completely, releasing more H+ ions:\n\nHCl → H+ + Cl-\n\nThe increased concentration of H+ ions in the solution shifts the equilibrium of the acetic acid ionization reaction to the left, reducing the ionization of acetic acid."
