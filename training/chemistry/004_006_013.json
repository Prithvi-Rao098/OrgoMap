    "message_2": "To determine the purity percentage of a given sample of aspirin using the melting point determination method, you will need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Obtain a sample of aspirin from the local pharmacy.\n2. Determine the theoretical melting point of pure aspirin. The melting point of pure aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) is approximately 138-140Â°C.\n3. Measure the melting point of the given aspirin sample using a melting point apparatus. To do this, crush a small amount of the aspirin sample into a fine powder and place it into a capillary tube. Insert the capillary tube into the melting point apparatus and slowly heat the sample while observing the temperature at which the sample begins to melt and the temperature at which it completely melts.\n4. Compare the observed melting point range of the sample to the theoretical melting point range of pure aspirin. If the observed melting point range is lower than the theoretical range and/or the range is wider, it indicates that the sample is impure. The closer the observed melting point range is to the theoretical range, the higher the purity of the sample.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the melting point determination method provides only an estimation of the purity of the sample. To obtain a more accurate purity percentage, other analytical techniques such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or gas chromatography (GC) should be used."
