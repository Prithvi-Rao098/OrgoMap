    "message_1": "What is the mass of copper in a sample of brass alloy that weighs 10.00 grams, given that the sample contains 70% copper and 30% zinc by weight, using gravimetric analysis?",
    "message_2": "To determine the mass of copper in the brass alloy sample, we can use the given percentage composition of the alloy. Since the sample contains 70% copper by weight, we can calculate the mass of copper as follows:\n\nMass of copper = (Percentage of copper / 100) × Total mass of the sample\nMass of copper = (70 / 100) × 10.00 grams\nMass of copper = 0.70 × 10.00 grams\nMass of copper = 7.00 grams\n\nSo, the mass of copper in the 10.00-gram brass alloy sample is 7.00 grams."
