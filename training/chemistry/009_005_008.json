    "message_2": "To calculate the nuclear binding energy for a Helium-4 nucleus, we first need to determine the mass defect. The mass defect is the difference between the mass of the individual nucleons (protons and neutrons) and the mass of the nucleus itself.\n\nGiven masses:\n- Mass of a proton (mp) = 1.007276466812 u\n- Mass of a neutron (mn) = 1.008664915 amu\n- Mass of a Helium-4 nucleus (mHe) = 4.001506179127 u\n\nFirst, let's find the total mass of the individual nucleons:\nTotal mass of 2 protons = 2 * mp = 2 * 1.007276466812 u = 2.014552933624 u\nTotal mass of 2 neutrons = 2 * mn = 2 * 1.008664915 u = 2.01732983 u\n\nNow, let's find the mass defect (Δm):\nΔm = (Total mass of 2 protons + Total mass of 2 neutrons) - mHe\nΔm = (2.014552933624 u + 2.01732983 u) - 4.001506179127 u\nΔm = 4.031882763624 u - 4.001506179127 u\nΔm = 0.030376584497 u\n\nNow, we need to convert the mass defect from atomic mass units (u) to kilograms (kg). 1 u = 1.66053906660 × 10^(-27) kg.\n\nΔm (in kg) = 0.030376584497 u * 1.66053906660 × 10^(-27) kg/u\nΔm (in kg) = 5.045049573 × 10^(-29) kg\n\nNow, we can use Einstein's equation, E=mc², to calculate the nuclear binding energy. The speed of light (c) is approximately 3.0 × 10^8 m/s.\n\nE = (5.045049573 × 10^(-29) kg) * (3.0 × 10^8 m/s)²\nE = 5.045049573 × 10^(-29) kg * 9.0 × 10^16 m²/s²\nE = 4.540544616 × 10^(-12) J\n\nThe nuclear binding energy for a Helium-4 nucleus is approximately 4.54 × 10^(-12) Joules."
