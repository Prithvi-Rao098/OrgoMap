    "message_2": "The decay mode for the isotope uranium-238 is alpha decay. When uranium-238 undergoes alpha decay, it emits an alpha particle, which consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. The resulting product is thorium-234. The nuclear equation for this decay process is:\n\nU-238 → Th-234 + α (alpha particle)"
