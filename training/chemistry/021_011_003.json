    "message_2": "The bond dissociation energy of a hydrogen molecule (H2) is approximately 436 kJ/mol.\n\nThe chemical equation for breaking the bond in a hydrogen molecule is:\n\nH2 â†’ 2H\n\nThis equation represents the process of breaking the single covalent bond between the two hydrogen atoms in the H2 molecule, resulting in the formation of two individual hydrogen atoms.\n\nBond dissociation energy is the amount of energy required to break a specific chemical bond in a molecule, in this case, the bond between the two hydrogen atoms in H2. It is usually expressed in units of kJ/mol (kilojoules per mole) or kcal/mol (kilocalories per mole). The bond dissociation energy value indicates the strength of the bond; the higher the value, the stronger the bond and the more energy required to break it. In the case of H2, the bond dissociation energy of 436 kJ/mol means that it takes 436 kJ of energy to break one mole of H2 molecules into individual hydrogen atoms."
