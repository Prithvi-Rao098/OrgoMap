    "message_2": "To calculate the bond order of N2+ using molecular orbital theory, we first need to determine the number of valence electrons in the molecule. Nitrogen has 7 electrons, and since there are two nitrogen atoms in N2, there would be a total of 14 electrons. However, since the molecule has a +1 charge, one electron is removed, leaving us with 13 electrons.\n\nNow, we need to fill the molecular orbitals according to the aufbau principle, which states that electrons fill orbitals in order of increasing energy. The molecular orbitals for N2 are as follows:\n\n1. σ1s\n2. σ*1s\n3. σ2s\n4. σ*2s\n5. π2px and π2py (degenerate orbitals, meaning they have the same energy)\n6. σ2pz\n7. π*2px and π*2py (degenerate orbitals)\n8. σ*2pz\n\nNow, let's fill the orbitals with the 13 electrons:\n\n1. σ1s - 2 electrons\n2. σ*1s - 2 electrons\n3. σ2s - 2 electrons\n4. σ*2s - 2 electrons\n5. π2px and π2py - 4 electrons (2 in each)\n6. σ2pz - 1 electron\n7. π*2px and π*2py - 0 electrons\n8. σ*2pz - 0 electrons\n\nNow, we can calculate the bond order using the formula:\n\nBond order = (number of electrons in bonding orbitals - number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\n\nBond order = (8 - 5) / 2 = 3 / 2 = 1.5\n\nSo, the bond order of N2+ is 1.5."
