    "message_2": "The solubility of potassium chloride (KCl) in water generally increases with increasing temperature. This means that as the temperature of the water increases, more KCl can dissolve in the water.\n\nTo determine the solubility of KCl at different temperatures, we can refer to solubility data from reference sources. Here is some solubility data for KCl in water at various temperatures:\n\nTemperature (Â°C) | Solubility (g KCl/100 g water)\n-----------------|-------------------------------\n0                | 28.1\n10               | 31.6\n20               | 34.4\n30               | 37.0\n40               | 39.7\n50               | 42.6\n60               | 45.8\n70               | 49.1\n80               | 52.6\n90               | 56.4\n100              | 60.6\n\nTo plot a graph of solubility versus temperature, you can use graphing software or create a graph by hand. On the x-axis, you would plot the temperature in degrees Celsius, and on the y-axis, you would plot the solubility in grams of KCl per 100 grams of water. Connect the data points with a smooth curve to represent the relationship between solubility and temperature.\n\nThe resulting graph will show an upward trend, indicating that the solubility of KCl in water increases as the temperature increases."
