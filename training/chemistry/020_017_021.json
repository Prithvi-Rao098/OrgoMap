    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (K) for the reaction, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation:\n\nCu²⁺(aq) + 4NH₃(aq) ⇌ [Cu(NH₃)₄]²⁺(aq)\n\nNext, we need to set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the concentrations of each species at equilibrium.\n\n|         | Cu²⁺ | NH₃ | [Cu(NH₃)₄]²⁺ |\n|---------|------|-----|-------------|\n| Initial | 0.10 | 0.20 | 0           |\n| Change  | -x   | -4x  | +x          |\n| Equilibrium | 0.10-x | 0.20-4x | x   |\n\nWe are given the equilibrium concentrations of Cu²⁺ and NH₃:\n\n[Cu²⁺] = 0.10 M\n[NH₃] = 0.20 M\n\nNow we can set up the expression for the equilibrium constant K:\n\nK = [ [Cu(NH₃)₄]²⁺ ] / ( [Cu²⁺] * [NH₃]⁴ )\n\nWe can plug in the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table:\n\nK = ( x ) / ( (0.10-x) * (0.20-4x)⁴ )\n\nSince x is the concentration of [Cu(NH₃)₄]²⁺ at equilibrium, we can solve for x using the given equilibrium concentrations:\n\n0.10 - x = 0.10 M (since the change in Cu²⁺ concentration is small, we can assume x is negligible)\n0.20 - 4x ≈ 0.20 M (since the change in NH₃ concentration is small, we can assume 4x is negligible)\n\nNow we can plug these approximations back into the K expression:\n\nK ≈ ( x ) / ( 0.10 * 0.20⁴ )\n\nTo find the value of x, we can use the fact that the reaction goes to completion, meaning all of the Cu²⁺ ions react with NH₃ to form [Cu(NH₃)₄]²⁺:\n\n0.10 M Cu²⁺ * (1 mol [Cu(NH₃)₄]²⁺ / 1 mol Cu²⁺) = 0.10 M [Cu(NH₃)₄]²⁺\n\nSo, x = 0.10 M. Now we can plug this value back into the K expression:\n\nK ≈ ( 0.10 ) / ( 0.10 * 0.20⁴ )\nK ≈ 1 / 0.20⁴\nK ≈ 1 / 0.0016\nK ≈ 625\n\nThe equilibrium constant for the reaction between 4NH₃ and Cu²⁺ ions to form the complex ion [Cu(NH₃)₄]²⁺ is approximately 625."
