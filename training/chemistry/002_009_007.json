    "message_2": "To find the empirical formula of the compound, we need to determine the mole ratio of sodium (Na), sulfur (S), and oxygen (O) in the compound. We can do this by converting the mass percentages to moles.\n\nAssume we have a 100 g sample of the compound. This means we have:\n23.1 g of sodium (Na)\n14.3 g of sulfur (S)\n62.6 g of oxygen (O)\n\nNow, we need to convert these masses to moles using the molar masses of each element:\nMolar mass of Na = 22.99 g/mol\nMolar mass of S = 32.07 g/mol\nMolar mass of O = 16.00 g/mol\n\nMoles of Na = 23.1 g / 22.99 g/mol = 1.005 moles\nMoles of S = 14.3 g / 32.07 g/mol = 0.446 moles\nMoles of O = 62.6 g / 16.00 g/mol = 3.913 moles\n\nNow, we need to find the mole ratio by dividing each value by the smallest number of moles:\nMole ratio of Na = 1.005 / 0.446 = 2.25\nMole ratio of S = 0.446 / 0.446 = 1\nMole ratio of O = 3.913 / 0.446 = 8.76\n\nSince these ratios are not whole numbers, we can round them to the nearest whole number to get the empirical formula:\nNa_2SO_8\n\nSo, the empirical formula of the compound is Na2SO8."
