    "message_2": "To identify the functional groups present in an unknown organic compound using IR (Infrared) and NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) spectroscopic techniques, follow these steps:\n\n1. Obtain the IR spectrum of the unknown compound:\nInfrared spectroscopy is used to identify the presence of specific functional groups in a molecule based on the absorption of infrared radiation at characteristic frequencies. Analyze the IR spectrum for the following key absorption bands:\n\na. O-H stretch: 3200-3600 cm⁻¹ (broad) - Indicates the presence of alcohol or carboxylic acid groups.\nb. N-H stretch: 3100-3500 cm⁻¹ (sharp) - Indicates the presence of amine or amide groups.\nc. C=O stretch: 1650-1750 cm⁻¹ - Indicates the presence of carbonyl groups (ketones, aldehydes, carboxylic acids, esters, or amides).\nd. C=C stretch: 1600-1680 cm⁻¹ - Indicates the presence of alkene groups.\ne. C≡C or C≡N stretch: 2100-2260 cm⁻¹ - Indicates the presence of alkyne or nitrile groups.\n\n2. Obtain the ¹H-NMR and/or ¹³C-NMR spectrum of the unknown compound:\nNMR spectroscopy provides information about the number and types of hydrogen (¹H-NMR) or carbon (¹³C-NMR) atoms in a molecule, as well as their chemical environment. Analyze the NMR spectrum for the following key signals:\n\na. Alkyl groups: 0.5-2.5 ppm (¹H-NMR) and 5-40 ppm (¹³C-NMR) - Indicates the presence of saturated carbon-hydrogen bonds.\nb. Alkenes: 4.5-6.5 ppm (¹H-NMR) and 100-150 ppm (¹³C-NMR) - Indicates the presence of carbon-carbon double bonds.\nc. Aromatics: 6.5-8.5 ppm (¹H-NMR) and 110-160 ppm (¹³C-NMR) - Indicates the presence of aromatic rings.\nd. Aldehydes: 9-10 ppm (¹H-NMR) and 190-210 ppm (¹³C-NMR) - Indicates the presence of aldehyde groups.\ne. Carboxylic acids: 10-12 ppm (¹H-NMR) and 160-185 ppm (¹³C-NMR) - Indicates the presence of carboxylic acid groups.\nf. Amides: 6-8 ppm (¹H-NMR) and 160-185 ppm (¹³C-NMR) - Indicates the presence of amide groups.\ng. Nitriles: 2-3 ppm (¹H-NMR) and 110-130 ppm (¹³C-NMR) - Indicates the presence of nitrile groups.\n\n3. Combine the information from the IR and NMR spectra to identify the functional groups present in the unknown compound. Compare the observed absorption bands and chemical shifts with known reference data to confirm the presence of specific functional groups.\n\nBy following these steps and analyzing the obtained spectra, you can successfully identify the functional groups present in an unknown organic compound using IR and NMR spectroscopic techniques."
