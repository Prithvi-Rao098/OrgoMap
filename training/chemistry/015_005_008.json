    "message_2": "To find the change in standard enthalpy (ΔH°) for the combustion of methane gas (CH4) at 25°C and a pressure of 1 atm, we need to use the balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane and the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) for each substance involved in the reaction.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane is:\n\nCH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l)\n\nNow, we need the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) for each substance at 25°C:\n\nΔHf° [CH4(g)] = -74.8 kJ/mol\nΔHf° [O2(g)] = 0 kJ/mol (since O2 is in its standard state)\nΔHf° [CO2(g)] = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔHf° [H2O(l)] = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nUsing Hess's Law, we can calculate the change in standard enthalpy (ΔH°) for the combustion of methane:\n\nΔH° = [ΔHf° (products) - ΔHf° (reactants)]\n\nΔH° = [1 × (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 × (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [1 × (-74.8 kJ/mol) + 2 × (0 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH° = (-393.5 - 2 × 285.8 + 74.8) kJ/mol\n\nΔH° = (-393.5 - 571.6 + 74.8) kJ/mol\n\nΔH° = -890.3 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the change in standard enthalpy (ΔH°) for the combustion of methane gas (CH4) at 25°C and a pressure of 1 atm is -890.3 kJ/mol."
