    "message_2": "To determine the lowest-energy excited state of a molecule with the molecular formula C5H5N (pyridine), we need to perform quantum chemical calculations. These calculations involve solving the Schr√∂dinger equation for the molecule and determining its electronic structure. There are several computational methods available to perform these calculations, such as Hartree-Fock (HF), Density Functional Theory (DFT), and post-Hartree-Fock methods like Configuration Interaction (CI) and Coupled Cluster (CC).\n\nFor this problem, we will use Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) as it is a widely used method for calculating excited states and provides a good balance between accuracy and computational cost.\n\nHere are the general steps to perform the calculations:\n\n1. Choose a basis set: A basis set is a set of functions used to represent the molecular orbitals. Common basis sets include STO-3G, 6-31G, and cc-pVDZ. The choice of basis set will affect the accuracy of the results.\n\n2. Optimize the molecular geometry: Before calculating the excited states, we need to find the lowest-energy geometry of the molecule. This can be done using a geometry optimization calculation at the DFT level.\n\n3. Perform TD-DFT calculations: Once the optimized geometry is obtained, we can perform TD-DFT calculations to determine the excited states of the molecule. This will provide information about the excitation energies and the nature of the excited states.\n\n4. Analyze the results: After obtaining the excited states, we can analyze the results to determine the lowest-energy excited state of the molecule.\n\nPlease note that performing these calculations requires specialized software and hardware. Some popular quantum chemistry software packages include Gaussian, ORCA, and Q-Chem. Once the calculations are performed, the lowest-energy excited state of the C5H5N molecule can be determined from the results."
