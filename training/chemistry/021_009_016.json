    "message_2": "To determine the bond order and magnetic property of the CO molecule, we need to first draw its Lewis structure.\n\nThe Lewis structure of CO is:\n\n:Câ‰¡O:\n\nCarbon has 4 valence electrons and oxygen has 6 valence electrons, making a total of 10 valence electrons. In the Lewis structure, carbon forms a triple bond with oxygen, using 6 of the valence electrons, and each atom has 2 lone pair electrons, using the remaining 4 valence electrons.\n\nNow, we can calculate the bond order. Bond order is defined as the number of bonds between two atoms divided by the number of bond groups between the atoms. In CO, there is a triple bond between carbon and oxygen, so the bond order is:\n\nBond order = (Number of bonds between C and O) / (Number of bond groups between C and O)\nBond order = 3 / 1\nBond order = 3\n\nTo determine if the molecule is diamagnetic or paramagnetic, we need to look at the number of unpaired electrons in the molecule. Diamagnetic molecules have all their electrons paired, while paramagnetic molecules have unpaired electrons.\n\nIn the CO molecule, both carbon and oxygen have all their electrons paired in the triple bond and lone pairs. Therefore, there are no unpaired electrons, and the CO molecule is diamagnetic.\n\nIn summary, the bond order of the CO molecule is 3, and it is a diamagnetic molecule."
