    "message_1": "What is the theoretical yield of 2,4-dinitrophenol that can be obtained from 50 grams of phenol and 100 mL of 50% nitric acid solution if the reaction is carried out at 50Â°C for 2 hours and the final product is purified using recrystallization method with a yield of 85%?",
    "message_2": "To determine the theoretical yield of 2,4-dinitrophenol, we need to first find the limiting reactant and then calculate the moles of product formed. Finally, we will apply the 85% yield from the recrystallization method.\n\n1. Find the moles of phenol and nitric acid:\nPhenol (C6H5OH) has a molar mass of 94 g/mol.\n50 g phenol * (1 mol phenol / 94 g) = 0.532 mol phenol\n\n100 mL of 50% nitric acid solution contains 50 mL of pure nitric acid (HNO3).\nThe density of nitric acid is 1.51 g/mL.\n50 mL HNO3 * (1.51 g/mL) = 75.5 g HNO3\nNitric acid has a molar mass of 63 g/mol.\n75.5 g HNO3 * (1 mol HNO3 / 63 g) = 1.20 mol HNO3\n\n2. Determine the limiting reactant:\nThe balanced chemical equation for the formation of 2,4-dinitrophenol is:\nC6H5OH + 2 HNO3 -> C6H3N2O5 + 2 H2O\n\nFrom the balanced equation, 1 mol of phenol reacts with 2 mol of nitric acid.\n0.532 mol phenol * (2 mol HNO3 / 1 mol phenol) = 1.064 mol HNO3 required\n\nSince we have 1.20 mol HNO3 available, which is more than the 1.064 mol required, phenol is the limiting reactant.\n\n3. Calculate the moles of 2,4-dinitrophenol formed:\n0.532 mol phenol * (1 mol C6H3N2O5 / 1 mol phenol) = 0.532 mol 2,4-dinitrophenol\n\n4. Apply the 85% yield from the recrystallization method:\n0.532 mol 2,4-dinitrophenol * 0.85 = 0.452 mol 2,4-dinitrophenol (actual yield)\n\n5. Calculate the theoretical yield in grams:\n2,4-dinitrophenol (C6H3N2O5) has a molar mass of 184 g/mol.\n0.452 mol 2,4-dinitrophenol * (184 g / 1 mol) = 83.16 g\n\nThe theoretical yield of 2,4-dinitrophenol obtained from 50 grams of phenol and 100 mL of 50% nitric acid solution under the given conditions is approximately 83.16 grams."
