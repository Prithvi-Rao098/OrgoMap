    "message_1": "What is the efficiency of an electrochemical cell that is made up of a copper electrode and a zinc electrode, with a salt bridge separating them, if the standard cell potential is 1.10 V and the measured cell potential is 0.95 V? The Faraday constant is 96,485 C/mol.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the efficiency of an electrochemical cell, we need to compare the measured cell potential to the standard cell potential. The efficiency can be expressed as a percentage.\n\nEfficiency = (Measured cell potential / Standard cell potential) × 100%\n\nGiven:\nStandard cell potential (E°) = 1.10 V\nMeasured cell potential (E) = 0.95 V\n\nEfficiency = (0.95 V / 1.10 V) × 100%\nEfficiency = 0.8636 × 100%\nEfficiency = 86.36%\n\nThe efficiency of the electrochemical cell is 86.36%."
