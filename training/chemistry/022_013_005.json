    "message_2": "In H2SO4, the oxidation state of sulfur is +6. Here's the breakdown:\n\nThere are two hydrogen atoms, each with an oxidation state of +1, contributing a total of +2. There are four oxygen atoms, each with an oxidation state of -2, contributing a total of -8. To balance the overall charge of the molecule, which is neutral, the sulfur atom must have an oxidation state of +6."
