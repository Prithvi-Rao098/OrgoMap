    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction.\n2. Calculate the number of moles of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) using its molar mass.\n3. Determine the number of moles of CO2 produced using the stoichiometry of the balanced equation.\n4. Use the ideal gas law to find the volume of CO2 produced.\n\nStep 1: Balanced chemical equation:\nCaCO3(s) + 2HCl(aq) → CaCl2(aq) + CO2(g) + H2O(l)\n\nStep 2: Calculate moles of CaCO3:\nMolar mass of CaCO3 = 40.08 (Ca) + 12.01 (C) + 3 * 16.00 (O) = 100.09 g/mol\n50 g CaCO3 * (1 mol CaCO3 / 100.09 g) = 0.499 moles of CaCO3\n\nStep 3: Determine moles of CO2 produced:\nFrom the balanced equation, 1 mole of CaCO3 produces 1 mole of CO2.\nSo, 0.499 moles of CaCO3 will produce 0.499 moles of CO2.\n\nStep 4: Use the ideal gas law to find the volume of CO2:\nThe ideal gas law is PV = nRT, where P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nWe are given the pressure (P) as 1 atm and the temperature (T) as 25°C, which is equivalent to 298.15 K. The ideal gas constant (R) is 0.0821 L atm / (mol K).\n\nNow, we can solve for the volume (V) of CO2:\n\nV = nRT / P\nV = (0.499 moles CO2) * (0.0821 L atm / (mol K)) * (298.15 K) / (1 atm)\nV = 12.20 L\n\nSo, the volume of CO2 gas produced when 50 grams of calcium carbonate reacts with an excess amount of hydrochloric acid at 25°C and 1 atm pressure is approximately 12.20 liters."
