    "message_2": "The most commonly used protecting group for alcohols in organic synthesis is the tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS) group. The TBS group is introduced to the alcohol by reacting it with tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBSCl) in the presence of a base, such as imidazole.\n\nThe mechanism of TBS removal under acidic conditions involves the following steps:\n\n1. Protonation of the oxygen atom in the TBS-protected alcohol by an acid (e.g., HCl or TFA). This generates a positively charged oxygen atom (oxonium ion) and makes it a better leaving group.\n\n2. Nucleophilic attack by a water molecule on the silicon atom of the TBS group. This forms a pentavalent silicon intermediate.\n\n3. The pentavalent silicon intermediate collapses, with the oxygen-silicon bond breaking and the TBS group leaving as a neutral species (tert-butyldimethylsilanol).\n\n4. Deprotonation of the oxonium ion by another water molecule, yielding the free alcohol and a hydronium ion.\n\nIn summary, the TBS protecting group is commonly used for alcohols in organic synthesis, and its removal under acidic conditions involves protonation, nucleophilic attack, bond cleavage, and deprotonation steps."
