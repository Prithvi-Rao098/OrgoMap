    "message_2": "In this reaction, the functional group involved is the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) present in ethanoic acid (CH3COOH).\n\nThe reaction mechanism for the reaction between ethanoic acid and sodium hydroxide is an acid-base reaction, also known as a neutralization reaction. Here's the step-by-step mechanism:\n\n1. Ethanoic acid (CH3COOH) donates a proton (H+) to the hydroxide ion (OH-) from sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n\nCH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O\n\n2. The acetate ion (CH3COO-) formed in the previous step combines with the sodium ion (Na+) from sodium hydroxide to form sodium ethanoate (CH3COONa).\n\nCH3COO- + Na+ → CH3COONa\n\nOverall reaction:\n\nCH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O\n\nIn summary, ethanoic acid reacts with sodium hydroxide through an acid-base reaction mechanism, involving the carboxylic acid functional group, to form sodium ethanoate and water."
