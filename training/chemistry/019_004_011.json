The balanced chemical equation is:\n\nCaO(s) + H2O(g) -> Ca(OH)2(s) \n\nGiven data:\n- The standard molar entropy of water vapor is 188.7 J/K/mol\n- The standard molar entropy of solid calcium oxide is 39.7 J/K/mol\n- The standard molar entropy of solid calcium hydroxide is 83.4 J/K/mol\n\nAssuming all substances are at standard conditions of 25 degrees Celsius and 1 atm pressure, calculate the change in entropy for the reaction.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the change in entropy for the reaction, we can use the formula:\n\nΔS_reaction = ΣS_products - ΣS_reactants\n\nFirst, let's find the total entropy of the reactants:\nEntropy of CaO(s) = 1 mol × 39.7 J/K/mol = 39.7 J/K\nEntropy of H2O(g) = 2 mol × 188.7 J/K/mol = 377.4 J/K\nTotal entropy of reactants = 39.7 J/K + 377.4 J/K = 417.1 J/K\n\nNow, let's find the total entropy of the products:\nEntropy of Ca(OH)2(s) = 1 mol × 83.4 J/K/mol = 83.4 J/K\nTotal entropy of products = 83.4 J/K\n\nNow we can calculate the change in entropy for the reaction:\nΔS_reaction = ΣS_products - ΣS_reactants\nΔS_reaction = 83.4 J/K - 417.1 J/K = -333.7 J/K\n\nThe total change in entropy for the reaction is -333.7 J/K."
