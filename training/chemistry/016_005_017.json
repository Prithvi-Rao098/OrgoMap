    "message_2": "To calculate the heat released during the combustion of 1 mole of ethane, we can use the balanced chemical equation for the combustion reaction and the given enthalpy values.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the combustion of ethane is:\n\nC2H6 + 7/2 O2 → 2 CO2 + 3 H2O\n\nUsing the given enthalpy values, we can calculate the heat released (ΔH) for the reaction using Hess's Law:\n\nΔH = Σ ΔH°f(products) - Σ ΔH°f(reactants)\n\nFor the products, we have 2 moles of CO2 and 3 moles of H2O:\n\nΔH°f(products) = 2 * ΔH°f(CO2) + 3 * ΔH°f(H2O)\nΔH°f(products) = 2 * (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 3 * (-285.8 kJ/mol)\nΔH°f(products) = -787 kJ + (-857.4 kJ)\nΔH°f(products) = -1644.4 kJ\n\nFor the reactants, we have 1 mole of C2H6 and 7/2 moles of O2. Since the enthalpy of formation for an element in its standard state (O2) is zero, we only need to consider the enthalpy of combustion for ethane:\n\nΔH°f(reactants) = ΔH°comb(C2H6)\nΔH°f(reactants) = -1560 kJ\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat released (ΔH) for the reaction:\n\nΔH = ΔH°f(products) - ΔH°f(reactants)\nΔH = -1644.4 kJ - (-1560 kJ)\nΔH = -84.4 kJ\n\nSo, the heat released when 1 mole of ethane is combusted in oxygen gas to form carbon dioxide and water is -84.4 kJ."
