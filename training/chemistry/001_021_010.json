    "message_2": "The major product formed from the reaction between 1-bromo-3-methylcyclohexane and sodium ethoxide in ethanol solvent with a heat source is 1-ethoxy-3-methylcyclohexane. This reaction proceeds via an E2 (bimolecular elimination) mechanism.\n\nMechanism of the reaction:\n\n1. Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) acts as a strong base in this reaction. The ethoxide ion (OEt-) abstracts a proton (H+) from the β-carbon (carbon adjacent to the carbon bearing the bromine atom) of 1-bromo-3-methylcyclohexane. In this case, the β-carbon is the one in the axial position, as it is anti-periplanar to the bromine atom, which is a requirement for the E2 mechanism.\n\n2. As the ethoxide ion abstracts the proton, the electrons from the C-H bond move to form a double bond between the α-carbon (carbon bearing the bromine atom) and the β-carbon.\n\n3. Simultaneously, the bromine atom leaves as a bromide ion (Br-), taking its bonding electrons with it. This results in the formation of 1-ethoxy-3-methylcyclohexane as the major product.\n\n4. The byproduct of this reaction is sodium bromide (NaBr), which is formed when the bromide ion associates with the sodium ion (Na+) from sodium ethoxide.\n\nOverall, the reaction is an E2 elimination reaction, resulting in the formation of 1-ethoxy-3-methylcyclohexane as the major product."
