    "message_2": "To find the empirical formula and molecular formula of the compound, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the mass percentages to grams.\n2. Convert grams to moles.\n3. Divide all the moles by the smallest mole value to get the mole ratio.\n4. If necessary, multiply the mole ratio by a whole number to get whole number subscripts.\n5. Determine the empirical formula.\n6. Determine the molecular formula using the molar mass of the compound (if provided).\n\nStep 1: Convert mass percentages to grams\nAssuming a 100 g sample size:\n- Sodium (Na): 24.69 g\n- Sulfur (S): 14.09 g\n- Oxygen (O): 61.22 g\n\nStep 2: Convert grams to moles\n- Moles of Na: 24.69 g / (22.99 g/mol) = 1.074 mol\n- Moles of S: 14.09 g / (32.07 g/mol) = 0.439 mol\n- Moles of O: 61.22 g / (16.00 g/mol) = 3.826 mol\n\nStep 3: Divide all the moles by the smallest mole value\n- Na: 1.074 / 0.439 = 2.45 ≈ 2\n- S: 0.439 / 0.439 = 1\n- O: 3.826 / 0.439 = 8.72 ≈ 8\n\nStep 4: The mole ratio is already in whole numbers.\n\nStep 5: Determine the empirical formula\nThe empirical formula is Na2SO8.\n\nStep 6: Determine the molecular formula\nSince we don't have the molar mass of the compound provided, we cannot determine the molecular formula. The empirical formula is the simplest representation of the compound, which is Na2SO8."
