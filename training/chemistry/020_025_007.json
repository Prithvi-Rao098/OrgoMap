    "message_2": "The reaction between iodine (I2) and iodide ions (I-) to produce triiodide ions (I3-) can be represented as follows:\n\nI2 + I- ⇌ I3-\n\nTo find the equilibrium constant (Kc), we can use the equilibrium concentrations of the reactants and products:\n\nKc = [I3-] / ([I2] * [I-])\n\nGiven the equilibrium concentrations:\n\n[I2] = 0.25 M\n[I-] = 0.35 M\n[I3-] = 0.05 M\n\nPlug these values into the Kc equation:\n\nKc = (0.05) / (0.25 * 0.35)\n\nKc = 0.05 / 0.0875\n\nKc ≈ 0.571\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for this reaction is approximately 0.571."
