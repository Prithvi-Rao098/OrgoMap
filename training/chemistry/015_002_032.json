    "message_2": "To determine the molecular geometry and bond angles for the molecule CF4 using the VSEPR theory, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the central atom: In CF4, the central atom is carbon (C).\n\n2. Count the number of electron groups around the central atom: Carbon has four valence electrons, and each fluorine atom contributes one electron. So, there are four electron groups (one for each C-F bond).\n\n3. Determine the electron group geometry: Since there are four electron groups, the electron group geometry is tetrahedral.\n\n4. Determine the molecular geometry: As there are no lone pairs on the central atom and all electron groups are bonding, the molecular geometry is also tetrahedral.\n\n5. Determine the bond angles: In a tetrahedral geometry, the bond angles are approximately 109.5 degrees.\n\nSo, the molecular geometry of CF4 is tetrahedral, and the bond angles are approximately 109.5 degrees."
