    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy change for the reaction between hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH), we first need to determine the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nHCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H2O(l)\n\nNext, we need to determine the limiting reactant. We have 50 mL of 1 M HCl, which means there are 50 mmol of HCl. We also have 75 mL of 2 M NaOH, which means there are 150 mmol of NaOH. Since the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, HCl is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow, we need to find the standard enthalpy change for the reaction. The standard enthalpy change for the reaction between HCl and NaOH is the enthalpy of neutralization, which is approximately -57.3 kJ/mol for strong acids and strong bases.\n\nSince we have 50 mmol of HCl reacting, we can calculate the total enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nΔH = -57.3 kJ/mol × (50 mmol / 1000 mmol/mol) = -2.865 kJ\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change for the reaction between 50 mL of 1 M hydrochloric acid and 75 mL of 2 M sodium hydroxide solution at 25°C is -2.865 kJ."
