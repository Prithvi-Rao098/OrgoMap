    "message_2": "To find the percent composition (by mass) of sulfur in the sample of sulfuric acid, you can use the following formula:\n\nPercent composition = (mass of sulfur / total mass of the sample) × 100\n\nIn this case, the mass of sulfur is 6.25 grams, and the total mass of the sample is 98.08 grams. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nPercent composition = (6.25 g / 98.08 g) × 100\n\nPercent composition ≈ 0.0637 × 100\n\nPercent composition ≈ 6.37%\n\nSo, the percent composition (by mass) of sulfur in the sample of sulfuric acid is approximately 6.37%."
