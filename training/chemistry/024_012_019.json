    "message_2": "The most effective leaching agent for the recovery of gold and silver from electronic waste using hydrometallurgical techniques is a combination of Aqua Regia and Cyanide solutions. \n\nAqua Regia, a mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) and concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl) in a 1:3 ratio, is highly effective in dissolving gold due to its strong oxidizing nature. It forms a soluble gold complex, chloroauric acid (HAuCl4), which can be easily separated from the remaining solid waste.\n\nFor silver recovery, cyanide leaching is the most common method. A dilute solution of sodium cyanide (NaCN) or potassium cyanide (KCN) is used to form a soluble silver complex, dicyanoargentate ([Ag(CN)2]-), which can be further processed to recover the silver.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that both Aqua Regia and Cyanide solutions are highly toxic and corrosive, and their use requires proper safety measures, waste management, and environmental considerations. Alternative, less toxic leaching agents, such as thiourea, thiosulfate, and ionic liquids, are being researched for their potential in gold and silver recovery from electronic waste."
