    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the fusion of 100 grams of ice at 0°C to liquid water at 0°C, we need to determine the number of moles of ice and then use the enthalpy of fusion to find the total enthalpy change.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of ice. The molar mass of water (H2O) is 18.015 g/mol.\n\nNumber of moles = (mass of ice) / (molar mass of water)\nNumber of moles = 100 g / 18.015 g/mol = 5.55 moles (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nNow, we can use the enthalpy of fusion (6.01 kJ/mol) to find the total enthalpy change for the fusion of 5.55 moles of ice.\n\nEnthalpy change = (number of moles) × (enthalpy of fusion)\nEnthalpy change = 5.55 moles × 6.01 kJ/mol = 33.36 kJ (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the fusion of 100 grams of ice at 0°C to liquid water at 0°C is 33.36 kJ."
