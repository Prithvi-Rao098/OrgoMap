    "message_2": "In the molecule SF6 (sulfur hexafluoride), the central atom is sulfur. To determine the hybridization of the central atom, we need to consider the number of electron domains around it.\n\nSulfur has 6 valence electrons, and each fluorine atom contributes 1 electron, making a total of 12 electrons around the sulfur atom. These 12 electrons form 6 electron domains (6 single bonds with fluorine atoms).\n\nAccording to the VSEPR theory, the electron domain geometry for 6 electron domains is octahedral. To achieve this geometry, the central sulfur atom undergoes sp3d2 hybridization, which means it uses one s, three p, and two d orbitals to form six equivalent sp3d2 hybrid orbitals. These hybrid orbitals are used to form bonds with the six fluorine atoms.\n\nSo, the hybridization of the central atom (sulfur) in the SF6 molecule is sp3d2."
