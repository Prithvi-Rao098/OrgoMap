    "message_2": "To calculate the concentration of iron (Fe) in the water sample, we can use the Beer-Lambert Law, which states:\n\nA = ε * c * l\n\nwhere A is the absorbance, ε is the molar absorptivity coefficient, c is the concentration of the solution, and l is the path length of the cuvette (usually 1 cm).\n\nWe are given the absorbance (A) as 0.52 and the molar absorptivity coefficient (ε) as 1.20 x 10^4 M^-1 cm^-1. We need to solve for the concentration (c) and assume the path length (l) is 1 cm.\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for c:\n\nc = A / (ε * l)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nc = 0.52 / (1.20 x 10^4 M^-1 cm^-1 * 1 cm)\n\nc = 0.52 / (1.20 x 10^4)\n\nc = 4.33 x 10^-5 M\n\nThe concentration of iron (Fe) in the water sample is approximately 4.33 x 10^-5 M."
