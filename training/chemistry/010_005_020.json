    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (K) for the electrochemical reaction between silver metal (Ag) and a silver ion (Ag+) at 298 K, we can use the Nernst equation. The Nernst equation relates the standard potential (E°) of a redox reaction to the equilibrium constant (K) and the temperature (T).\n\nThe Nernst equation is:\n\nE = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\n\nwhere:\nE = cell potential\nE° = standard potential\nR = gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\nT = temperature (298 K)\nn = number of electrons transferred (1 in this case)\nF = Faraday's constant (96,485 C/mol)\nQ = reaction quotient\n\nAt equilibrium, E = 0 and Q = K. Therefore, the Nernst equation becomes:\n\n0 = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(K)\n\nNow, we can solve for K:\n\nln(K) = (nFE°)/(RT)\nK = e^((nFE°)/(RT))\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nK = e^((1 * 96,485 C/mol * 0.80 V)/(8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K))\n\nK = e^(64.516)\n\nK ≈ 1.42 x 10^28\n\nThe equilibrium constant for the electrochemical reaction between silver metal (Ag) and a silver ion (Ag+) at 298 K is approximately 1.42 x 10^28."
