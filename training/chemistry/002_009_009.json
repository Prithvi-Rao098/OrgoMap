    "message_2": "To find the empirical formula of a compound, follow these steps:\n\n1. Assume you have 100 grams of the compound. This means you have 25.9 grams of sodium (Na), 28.9 grams of sulfur (S), and 45.2 grams of oxygen (O).\n\n2. Convert the mass of each element to moles by dividing by their respective molar masses:\n\nMolar mass of Na = 22.99 g/mol\nMoles of Na = 25.9 g / 22.99 g/mol = 1.127 mol\n\nMolar mass of S = 32.07 g/mol\nMoles of S = 28.9 g / 32.07 g/mol = 0.901 mol\n\nMolar mass of O = 16.00 g/mol\nMoles of O = 45.2 g / 16.00 g/mol = 2.825 mol\n\n3. Divide each mole value by the smallest mole value to get the mole ratio:\n\nMole ratio of Na = 1.127 mol / 0.901 mol = 1.251\nMole ratio of S = 0.901 mol / 0.901 mol = 1\nMole ratio of O = 2.825 mol / 0.901 mol = 3.135\n\n4. Round the mole ratios to the nearest whole number. If the numbers are close to a whole number, round them. If not, multiply all the numbers by the smallest possible factor to get whole numbers:\n\nMole ratio of Na = 1.251 ≈ 1\nMole ratio of S = 1\nMole ratio of O = 3.135 ≈ 3\n\n5. Write the empirical formula using the whole number mole ratios:\n\nThe empirical formula is NaSO₃."
