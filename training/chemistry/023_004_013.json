    "message_2": "To determine the theoretical yield of acetylsalicylic acid, we first need to identify the limiting reactant and then use stoichiometry to calculate the amount of product formed.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the synthesis of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) from salicylic acid and acetic anhydride is:\n\nC7H6O3 (salicylic acid) + C4H6O3 (acetic anhydride) â†’ C9H8O4 (acetylsalicylic acid) + C2H4O2 (acetic acid)\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of each reactant:\n\n1. Salicylic acid (C7H6O3) has a molar mass of 138.12 g/mol.\nMoles of salicylic acid = (3.0 g) / (138.12 g/mol) = 0.0217 mol\n\n2. Acetic anhydride (C4H6O3) has a molar mass of 102.09 g/mol and a density of 1.08 g/mL.\nMass of acetic anhydride = (5.0 mL) * (1.08 g/mL) = 5.4 g\nMoles of acetic anhydride = (5.4 g) / (102.09 g/mol) = 0.0529 mol\n\nNow, we need to determine the limiting reactant:\n\nMole ratio of salicylic acid to acetic anhydride in the balanced equation is 1:1.\n\n0.0217 mol (salicylic acid) / 0.0529 mol (acetic anhydride) = 0.41\n\nSince the ratio is less than 1, salicylic acid is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow, we can calculate the theoretical yield of acetylsalicylic acid (C9H8O4) using stoichiometry:\n\nMoles of acetylsalicylic acid = moles of salicylic acid (limiting reactant) = 0.0217 mol\n\nThe molar mass of acetylsalicylic acid is 180.16 g/mol.\n\nTheoretical yield of acetylsalicylic acid = (0.0217 mol) * (180.16 g/mol) = 3.91 g\n\nSo, the theoretical yield of acetylsalicylic acid that can be obtained when 3.0 grams of salicylic acid and 5.0 mL of acetic anhydride are reacted together is approximately 3.91 grams."
