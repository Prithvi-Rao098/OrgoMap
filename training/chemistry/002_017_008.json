    "message_2": "To determine the rate constant for the reaction between nitric oxide (NO) and oxygen gas (O₂) at 500°C, we can use the integrated rate law for a second-order reaction. The reaction is given as:\n\n2NO + O₂ → 2NO₂\n\nSince the stoichiometry of NO and O₂ is 2:1, the rate law for this reaction can be written as:\n\nrate = k[NO]²[O₂]\n\nFirst, we need to find the change in concentration of NO over the given time period (150 seconds). The initial concentration of NO is 0.02 mol/L, and the final concentration is 0.015 mol/L. Therefore, the change in concentration is:\n\nΔ[NO] = 0.02 mol/L - 0.015 mol/L = 0.005 mol/L\n\nSince the stoichiometry of NO and O₂ is 2:1, the change in concentration of O₂ is half the change in concentration of NO:\n\nΔ[O₂] = 0.5 * Δ[NO] = 0.5 * 0.005 mol/L = 0.0025 mol/L\n\nNow, we can use the integrated rate law for a second-order reaction:\n\n1/[A] - 1/[A₀] = kt\n\nwhere [A] is the final concentration of NO, [A₀] is the initial concentration of NO, k is the rate constant, and t is the time in seconds.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n1/0.015 - 1/0.02 = k * 150\n\nSolving for k:\n\n0.0667 - 0.05 = k * 150\n0.0167 = k * 150\n\nk = 0.0167 / 150\nk ≈ 1.11 × 10⁻⁴ L/(mol·s)\n\nSo, the rate constant for the reaction between nitric oxide and oxygen gas at 500°C is approximately 1.11 × 10⁻⁴ L/(mol·s)."
