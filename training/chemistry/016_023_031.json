    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of methyl acetate, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nMethyl acetate (CH3COOCH3) + Water (H2O) → Acetic acid (CH3COOH) + Methanol (CH3OH)\n\nNow, we need to determine the bond enthalpies for the reactants and products.\n\nReactants:\n1 C-O bond in methyl acetate: 1 x 360 kJ/mol = 360 kJ/mol\n1 C=O bond in methyl acetate: 1 x 740 kJ/mol = 740 kJ/mol\n3 C-H bonds in methyl acetate: 3 x 410 kJ/mol = 1230 kJ/mol\n2 O-H bonds in water: 2 x 460 kJ/mol = 920 kJ/mol\n\nTotal bond enthalpy for reactants: 360 + 740 + 1230 + 920 = 3250 kJ/mol\n\nProducts:\n1 C-O bond in acetic acid: 1 x 360 kJ/mol = 360 kJ/mol\n1 C=O bond in acetic acid: 1 x 740 kJ/mol = 740 kJ/mol\n3 C-H bonds in acetic acid: 3 x 410 kJ/mol = 1230 kJ/mol\n1 O-H bond in acetic acid: 1 x 460 kJ/mol = 460 kJ/mol\n1 O-H bond in methanol: 1 x 460 kJ/mol = 460 kJ/mol\n3 C-H bonds in methanol: 3 x 410 kJ/mol = 1230 kJ/mol\n\nTotal bond enthalpy for products: 360 + 740 + 1230 + 460 + 460 + 1230 = 3780 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nΔH = Bond enthalpy of products - Bond enthalpy of reactants\nΔH = 3780 kJ/mol - 3250 kJ/mol\nΔH = 530 kJ/mol\n\nSince we are calculating the enthalpy change for 5 moles of methyl acetate, we need to multiply the enthalpy change per mole by 5:\n\nΔH for 5 moles = 530 kJ/mol x 5 moles = 2650 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 5 moles of methyl acetate is 2650 kJ."
