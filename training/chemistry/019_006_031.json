    "message_1": "What is the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the following chemical reaction at 25°C, if the concentration of CO2 is 0.025 M, the concentration of H2 is 0.050 M and the concentration of CO and H2O are found to be 0.010 M and 0.015 M, respectively?\n\nCO2 (g) + H2 (g) ⇌ CO (g) + H2O (g)",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction, we can use the formula:\n\nKc = [CO][H2O] / [CO2][H2]\n\nWe are given the concentrations of all the species involved in the reaction:\n\n[CO2] = 0.025 M\n[H2] = 0.050 M\n[CO] = 0.010 M\n[H2O] = 0.015 M\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nKc = (0.010 M)(0.015 M) / (0.025 M)(0.050 M)\n\nKc = 0.00015 M² / 0.00125 M²\n\nKc = 0.12\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction at 25°C is 0.12."
