    "message_2": "To determine the specific surface area of the zeolite sample using the BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) method, we need to obtain the adsorption data from the nitrogen gas adsorption experiment at -196°C and a pressure range of 0.05-0.3 P/Po. The BET equation is given by:\n\nN = Nm * C * (P/Po) / [(1 - (P/Po)) * (1 + (C - 1) * (P/Po))]\n\nWhere:\nN = amount of gas adsorbed at a given relative pressure (P/Po)\nNm = monolayer capacity (amount of gas adsorbed to form a complete monolayer)\nC = BET constant related to the energy of adsorption\nP/Po = relative pressure\n\nBy plotting 1/[(P/Po) * (1 - P/Po)] versus P/Po and fitting a straight line to the data points, we can obtain the slope (S) and intercept (I) of the plot. The BET constants Nm and C can be calculated using the following relationships:\n\nNm = 1 / (S + I)\nC = 1 + (S / I)\n\nOnce we have the values of Nm and C, we can calculate the specific surface area (SSA) of the zeolite sample using the following equation:\n\nSSA = (N_A * V_m * A_m) / M\n\nWhere:\nN_A = Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23 molecules/mol)\nV_m = molar volume of the adsorbate gas (nitrogen) at standard temperature and pressure (STP) = 22.414 L/mol\nA_m = cross-sectional area of the adsorbate molecule (for nitrogen, A_m = 0.162 nm^2)\nM = mass of the sample (0.5 grams)\n\nHowever, since we do not have the adsorption data (P/Po and N values) from the nitrogen gas adsorption experiment, we cannot calculate the specific surface area of the zeolite sample. If you provide the adsorption data, we can proceed with the calculations."
