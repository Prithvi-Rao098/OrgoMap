The cross-sectional area of a nitrogen gas molecule at that temperature is 0.162 nm² and the density of nitrogen gas is 0.808 g/L at that temperature and pressure.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory, which relates the amount of gas adsorbed on a solid surface to the surface area of the solid. The BET equation is:\n\nV = (V_m * C * P) / [(P_0 - P) * (1 + (C - 1) * P / P_0)]\n\nwhere V is the volume of gas adsorbed at pressure P, V_m is the monolayer volume of gas adsorbed, C is the BET constant, and P_0 is the saturation pressure of the gas. In this case, we are given the mass of nitrogen gas adsorbed (2.5 g) and the pressure (1 atm), and we need to find the surface area of the solid sample.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of nitrogen gas adsorbed to volume. Using the density of nitrogen gas (0.808 g/L) at 77 K and 1 atm:\n\nVolume of nitrogen gas adsorbed (V) = mass / density\nV = 2.5 g / 0.808 g/L\nV = 3.094 L\n\nNow, we need to find the monolayer volume of gas adsorbed (V_m). This can be calculated using the cross-sectional area of a nitrogen gas molecule (0.162 nm²) and the Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23 molecules/mol):\n\nMonolayer volume of gas adsorbed (V_m) = cross-sectional area * Avogadro's number / (1000 * 1000 * 1000) (to convert nm³ to L)\nV_m = 0.162 nm² * 6.022 x 10^23 molecules/mol / (1000 * 1000 * 1000)\nV_m = 0.0975 L/mol\n\nSince we are given that the solid sample is exposed to an excess amount of gas, we can assume that the pressure P is equal to the saturation pressure P_0. Therefore, the BET equation simplifies to:\n\nV = V_m * C\n\nWe can now solve for the BET constant C:\n\nC = V / V_m\nC = 3.094 L / 0.0975 L/mol\nC = 31.74 mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the surface area of the solid sample using the monolayer volume of gas adsorbed (V_m) and the BET constant (C):\n\nSurface area = V_m * C * cross-sectional area * Avogadro's number\nSurface area = 0.0975 L/mol * 31.74 mol * 0.162 nm² * 6.022 x 10^23 molecules/mol\nSurface area = 3.03 x 10^6 nm²\n\nSo, the surface area of the powdered solid sample is approximately 3.03 x 10^6 nm²."
