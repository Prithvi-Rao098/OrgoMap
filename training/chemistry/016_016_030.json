    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of reduction per mole of the metal oxide, we first need to determine the number of moles of the metal oxide in the 5.60 g sample. To do this, we need the molar mass of the metal oxide. Unfortunately, the problem does not provide enough information to determine the molar mass of the metal oxide. \n\nHowever, we can still set up the equation to solve for the enthalpy of reduction per mole of the metal oxide, assuming we had the molar mass. \n\nLet's denote the molar mass of the metal oxide as M. The number of moles of the metal oxide in the 5.60 g sample can be calculated as:\n\nmoles = (5.60 g) / M\n\nNow, we can use the enthalpy change for the reaction (-129.3 kJ/mol) to determine the enthalpy of reduction per mole of the metal oxide:\n\nEnthalpy of reduction per mole = (Enthalpy change for the reaction) / (moles of metal oxide)\nEnthalpy of reduction per mole = (-129.3 kJ/mol) / (5.60 g / M)\n\nIf we had the molar mass of the metal oxide, we could plug it into this equation to find the enthalpy of reduction per mole."
