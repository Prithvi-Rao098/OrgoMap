    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of moles and the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid:\n\nNaOH + HCl → NaCl + H2O\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of NaOH reacts with 1 mole of HCl.\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of HCl in the 25 mL of 0.15 M solution:\n\nmoles of HCl = Molarity × Volume\nmoles of HCl = 0.15 mol/L × 0.025 L (since 25 mL = 0.025 L)\nmoles of HCl = 0.00375 mol\n\nSince the mole ratio of NaOH to HCl is 1:1, we need 0.00375 moles of NaOH to neutralize the HCl.\n\nNow, we can find the volume of 0.1 M NaOH solution required:\n\nVolume = moles of NaOH / Molarity of NaOH\nVolume = 0.00375 mol / 0.1 mol/L\nVolume = 0.0375 L\n\nTo convert the volume to milliliters:\n\nVolume = 0.0375 L × 1000 mL/L\nVolume = 37.5 mL\n\nSo, 37.5 mL of 0.1 M sodium hydroxide is required to neutralize 25 mL of 0.15 M hydrochloric acid."
