    "message_2": "To determine the boiling point of a sodium chloride (NaCl) solution with a concentration of 0.1 mol/L, we can use the boiling point elevation formula:\n\nΔTb = Kb × m × i\n\nwhere ΔTb is the boiling point elevation, Kb is the ebullioscopic constant of water (0.512°C·kg/mol), m is the molality of the solution, and i is the van't Hoff factor (which is 2 for NaCl, as it dissociates into two ions: Na+ and Cl-).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the concentration (0.1 mol/L) to molality. Molality is defined as moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. Assuming the density of water is 1 g/mL, 1 L of water weighs 1000 g or 1 kg. Thus, the molality of the solution is also 0.1 mol/kg.\n\nNow, we can use the formula:\n\nΔTb = (0.512°C·kg/mol) × (0.1 mol/kg) × 2\nΔTb = 0.1024°C\n\nThe boiling point elevation is 0.1024°C. Since the normal boiling point of water is 100°C, the boiling point of the 0.1 mol/L NaCl solution is:\n\n100°C + 0.1024°C = 100.1024°C\n\nSo, the boiling point of the NaCl solution at a concentration of 0.1 mol/L is approximately 100.1°C."
