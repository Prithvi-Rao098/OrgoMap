    "message_2": "When sodium (Na) reacts with chlorine (Cl), an inorganic compound called sodium chloride (NaCl) is formed. This compound is an ionic compound. \n\nJustification:\nSodium is a metal (alkali metal) from Group 1 of the periodic table, and it has one electron in its outermost shell. Chlorine is a non-metal (halogen) from Group 17 of the periodic table, and it has seven electrons in its outermost shell. When sodium reacts with chlorine, sodium loses its one valence electron to achieve a stable electron configuration, forming a positively charged ion (Na+). Chlorine gains this electron to complete its outermost shell, forming a negatively charged ion (Cl-). The electrostatic attraction between these oppositely charged ions results in the formation of an ionic compound, sodium chloride (NaCl)."
