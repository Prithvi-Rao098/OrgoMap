    "message_2": "The most efficient method for synthesizing a new adhesive that meets both high strength and low toxicity standards in chemical engineering would involve the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the desired properties: Determine the specific requirements for the adhesive, such as bonding strength, flexibility, temperature resistance, and chemical resistance. This will help guide the selection of appropriate materials and synthesis methods.\n\n2. Research existing adhesives: Investigate existing adhesives with similar properties to identify potential starting points for the new adhesive. This may involve reviewing scientific literature, patents, and commercial products.\n\n3. Select base materials: Choose one or more base materials that have low toxicity and can provide the desired properties. These materials may include natural polymers (e.g., cellulose, starch, or proteins), synthetic polymers (e.g., polyurethane, epoxy, or acrylic), or hybrid materials that combine both natural and synthetic components.\n\n4. Optimize formulation: Experiment with different combinations of base materials, additives, and crosslinking agents to achieve the desired properties. This may involve varying the ratios of components, testing different curing methods, or incorporating functional groups to enhance bonding strength or reduce toxicity.\n\n5. Characterize the adhesive: Perform thorough testing of the synthesized adhesive to evaluate its properties, such as tensile strength, shear strength, peel strength, and elongation. Additionally, assess the adhesive's toxicity using appropriate in vitro and in vivo models to ensure it meets safety standards.\n\n6. Scale-up and manufacturing: Once the optimal formulation has been identified, develop a scalable synthesis process and establish quality control measures to ensure consistent production of the adhesive.\n\n7. Conduct application testing: Test the adhesive in its intended applications to ensure it performs as expected and meets the required performance standards.\n\nBy following these steps, a chemist can efficiently develop a new adhesive that meets both high strength and low toxicity standards in chemical engineering."
