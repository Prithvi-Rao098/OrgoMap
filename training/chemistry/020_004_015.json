    "message_2": "The addition of a catalyst to a chemical reaction does not affect the equilibrium position of the reaction. A catalyst works by lowering the activation energy of the reaction, which increases the rate at which the reaction proceeds. However, it does not change the thermodynamics of the reaction, meaning that the equilibrium constant (K) remains the same.\n\nA catalyst affects both the forward and reverse reactions equally, so the rate at which the products are formed and the rate at which the reactants are reformed both increase. As a result, the system reaches equilibrium more quickly, but the equilibrium position itself remains unchanged.\n\nLet's consider an example to illustrate this concept:\n\nSuppose we have a reversible reaction:\n\nA + B ⇌ C + D\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is given by:\n\nK = [C][D] / [A][B]\n\nNow, let's say we add a catalyst to this reaction. The catalyst will lower the activation energy for both the forward reaction (A + B → C + D) and the reverse reaction (C + D → A + B). This means that both reactions will proceed at a faster rate, but the ratio of the concentrations of products to reactants at equilibrium will remain the same.\n\nIn other words, the catalyst helps the reaction reach equilibrium more quickly, but it does not change the equilibrium position or the equilibrium constant (K) of the reaction."
