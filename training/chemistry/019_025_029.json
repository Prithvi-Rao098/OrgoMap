    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction, we need to use the following equation:\n\nΔH° = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH° is the standard enthalpy change of the reaction, and ΔHf° is the standard enthalpy of formation of each compound.\n\nFirst, we need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nCu(NH3)4SO4(s) + 4NaOH(aq) → Cu(OH)2(s) + 4NH3(g) + Na2SO4(aq) + 2H2O(l)\n\nNow, we need to find the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) for each compound involved in the reaction. These values can be found in standard thermodynamic tables or online databases. The values are as follows:\n\nΔHf° [Cu(NH3)4SO4(s)] = -315.5 kJ/mol\nΔHf° [NaOH(aq)] = -469.15 kJ/mol\nΔHf° [Cu(OH)2(s)] = -636.1 kJ/mol\nΔHf° [NH3(g)] = -45.9 kJ/mol\nΔHf° [Na2SO4(aq)] = -1377.3 kJ/mol\nΔHf° [H2O(l)] = -285.83 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔH° = [1(-636.1) + 4(-45.9) + 1(-1377.3) + 2(-285.83)] - [1(-315.5) + 4(-469.15)]\n\nΔH° = (-636.1 - 183.6 - 1377.3 - 571.66) - (-315.5 - 1876.6)\n\nΔH° = (-2768.66) - (-2192.1)\n\nΔH° = -576.56 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the reaction is -576.56 kJ/mol."
