    "message_1": "What volume of hydrogen gas will be produced when 20 g of magnesium react with excess hydrochloric acid in a closed container with a volume of 2.5 L at 25°C and a pressure of 1 atm?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the stoichiometry of the reaction and the ideal gas law (PV = nRT).\n\nFirst, let's write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between magnesium (Mg) and hydrochloric acid (HCl):\n\nMg (s) + 2 HCl (aq) → MgCl₂ (aq) + H₂ (g)\n\nNow, we need to find the moles of magnesium (Mg) that are reacting. The molar mass of magnesium is 24.31 g/mol.\n\nmoles of Mg = (mass of Mg) / (molar mass of Mg)\nmoles of Mg = (20 g) / (24.31 g/mol) = 0.822 mol\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of Mg produces 1 mole of H₂ gas. Therefore, 0.822 mol of Mg will produce 0.822 mol of H₂ gas.\n\nNow, we can use the ideal gas law (PV = nRT) to find the volume of hydrogen gas produced. The given conditions are:\n\nP = 1 atm (pressure)\nn = 0.822 mol (moles of H₂)\nR = 0.0821 L atm/mol K (ideal gas constant)\nT = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K (temperature in Kelvin)\n\nRearranging the ideal gas law to solve for the volume (V):\n\nV = nRT / P\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nV = (0.822 mol) × (0.0821 L atm/mol K) × (298.15 K) / (1 atm)\nV ≈ 20.02 L\n\nHowever, the container has a volume of only 2.5 L. Since the volume of hydrogen gas produced (20.02 L) is greater than the volume of the container (2.5 L), the hydrogen gas will fill the entire container.\n\nTherefore, the volume of hydrogen gas produced in the closed container will be 2.5 L."
