    "message_2": "To calculate the cell potential for the given cell, we will use the Nernst equation:\n\nE_cell = E°_cell - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\n\nwhere E_cell is the cell potential, E°_cell is the standard cell potential, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin (298 K), n is the number of electrons transferred in the redox reaction, F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol), and Q is the reaction quotient.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the standard cell potential (E°_cell). Since the given cell reaction is:\n\nFe(s) | Fe2+ (0.10 M) || Cu2+ (1.0 M) | Cu(s)\n\nThe overall cell reaction can be written as:\n\nFe(s) + Cu2+ -> Fe2+ + Cu(s)\n\nTo obtain this reaction, we need to reverse the Fe3+ + e- -> Fe2+ reaction and add it to the Cu2+ + 2e- -> Cu reaction:\n\nFe2+ -> Fe3+ + e- (E° = -0.77 V)\nCu2+ + 2e- -> Cu (E° = 0.34 V)\n-------------------------------\nFe(s) + Cu2+ -> Fe2+ + Cu(s)\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard cell potential:\n\nE°_cell = E°_cathode - E°_anode = 0.34 V - (-0.77 V) = 1.11 V\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of electrons transferred in the reaction (n). In this case, n = 1 (from the Fe2+ -> Fe3+ reaction).\n\nNow, we can calculate the reaction quotient (Q):\n\nQ = [Fe2+] / [Cu2+]\nQ = (0.10 M) / (1.0 M) = 0.10\n\nFinally, we can plug all the values into the Nernst equation:\n\nE_cell = 1.11 V - (8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K) / (1 * 96,485 C/mol) * ln(0.10)\nE_cell = 1.11 V - (0.0257 V) * ln(0.10)\nE_cell = 1.11 V - (-0.0592 V)\nE_cell = 1.1692 V\n\nSo, the cell potential for the given cell at 298 K is 1.1692 V."
