    "message_2": "Bioluminescence is the production and emission of light by living organisms, such as fireflies, certain types of fungi, and marine creatures like jellyfish and deep-sea fish. The specific photochemical properties responsible for bioluminescence involve a chemical reaction between a light-emitting molecule called a luciferin and an enzyme called luciferase or a photoprotein.\n\n1. Luciferin: This is the light-emitting molecule that undergoes a chemical reaction to produce light. Different organisms have different types of luciferins, such as bacterial luciferin, firefly luciferin, and coelenterazine, which is found in many marine organisms.\n\n2. Luciferase: This enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of luciferin, resulting in the production of an excited-state molecule. The excited molecule then releases energy in the form of light as it returns to its ground state. Different organisms have different luciferases, which can result in different colors of emitted light.\n\n3. Photoproteins: In some organisms, bioluminescence is produced by photoproteins instead of luciferase. Photoproteins are proteins that bind to a luciferin molecule and undergo a conformational change when they interact with a specific ion, such as calcium. This conformational change triggers the oxidation of the luciferin and the emission of light.\n\nIn non-bioluminescent organisms, these specific photochemical properties are absent. They do not possess the necessary luciferin, luciferase, or photoprotein molecules to produce light through a chemical reaction. Additionally, non-bioluminescent organisms may lack the cellular structures or organelles, such as photophores or specialized light-emitting cells, that facilitate bioluminescence in bioluminescent species.\n\nIn summary, the specific photochemical properties responsible for bioluminescence in certain organisms involve the presence of luciferin, luciferase or photoprotein molecules, and the necessary cellular structures to facilitate light production. These properties are absent in non-bioluminescent counterparts."
