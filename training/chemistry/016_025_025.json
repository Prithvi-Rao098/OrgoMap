    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change, we first need to determine the number of moles of KCl being dissolved. \n\nThe molar mass of KCl is:\nK = 39.1 g/mol\nCl = 35.5 g/mol\nKCl = 39.1 + 35.5 = 74.6 g/mol\n\nNow we can find the number of moles of KCl:\nmoles = mass / molar mass\nmoles = 6.0 g / 74.6 g/mol = 0.0804 mol\n\nNext, we can use the molar heat of dissolution to find the enthalpy change:\nenthalpy change = moles × molar heat of dissolution\nenthalpy change = 0.0804 mol × (-57.3 kJ/mol) = -4.61 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change when 6.0 grams of potassium chloride is dissolved in 200.0 mL of water at 25°C is -4.61 kJ."
