    "message_2": "To determine the purity of a sample of substance X based on its melting point range and comparison to literature values, you will need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Obtain the melting point range of the pure substance X from the literature. This is the range within which the pure substance is expected to melt.\n\n2. Measure the melting point range of your sample using a melting point apparatus. This involves heating the sample at a controlled rate and observing the temperature at which the sample starts to melt and the temperature at which it completely melts. The difference between these two temperatures is the melting point range of your sample.\n\n3. Compare the melting point range of your sample to the literature value. If the melting point range of your sample is narrow (1-2°C) and close to the literature value, it indicates that the sample is relatively pure. If the melting point range of your sample is wider (more than 2°C) or lower than the literature value, it suggests that the sample is impure.\n\n4. Calculate the purity percentage by comparing the melting point range of your sample to the literature value. This can be done using the following formula:\n\nPurity percentage = [(Measured melting point range - Literature melting point range) / Literature melting point range] × 100\n\nA negative value indicates impurity in the sample, while a value close to zero indicates a high degree of purity.\n\nKeep in mind that this method provides an estimate of the purity of the sample and may not be accurate for all substances. Other methods, such as chromatography or spectroscopy, may be required for a more accurate determination of purity."
