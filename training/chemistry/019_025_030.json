    "message_2": "To determine the standard enthalpy change for the reaction of CoCl2·6H2O with NaOH to form Na[Co(OH)4], we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nCoCl2·6H2O + 4NaOH → Na[Co(OH)4] + 2NaCl + 6H2O\n\nNext, we need to find the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) for all the compounds involved in the reaction. The standard enthalpies of formation are typically found in tables in chemistry textbooks or online resources. For this problem, I will provide the values:\n\nΔHf° (CoCl2·6H2O) = -198.5 kJ/mol\nΔHf° (NaOH) = -425.6 kJ/mol\nΔHf° (Na[Co(OH)4]) = -1041.2 kJ/mol\nΔHf° (NaCl) = -411.1 kJ/mol\nΔHf° (H2O) = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can use Hess's Law to calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nΔH° = Σ [ΔHf° (products)] - Σ [ΔHf° (reactants)]\n\nΔH° = [1(-1041.2) + 2(-411.1) + 6(-285.8)] - [1(-198.5) + 4(-425.6)]\n\nΔH° = [-1041.2 - 822.2 - 1714.8] - [-198.5 - 1702.4]\n\nΔH° = [-3578.2] - [-1900.9]\n\nΔH° = -1677.3 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the reaction of CoCl2·6H2O with NaOH to form Na[Co(OH)4] is -1677.3 kJ/mol. Since the value is negative, the reaction is exothermic, meaning it releases heat.\n\nNow, let's find the standard enthalpy change for the reaction of CoCl2 with NaOH:\n\nCoCl2 + 4NaOH → Na[Co(OH)4] + 2NaCl\n\nWe already have the standard enthalpies of formation for NaOH, Na[Co(OH)4], and NaCl. We just need the value for CoCl2:\n\nΔHf° (CoCl2) = -643.0 kJ/mol\n\nUsing Hess's Law again:\n\nΔH° = [1(-1041.2) + 2(-411.1)] - [1(-643.0) + 4(-425.6)]\n\nΔH° = [-1041.2 - 822.2] - [-643.0 - 1702.4]\n\nΔH° = [-1863.4] - [-2345.4]\n\nΔH° = 482.0 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the reaction of CoCl2 with NaOH is 482.0 kJ/mol. Since the value is positive, the reaction is endothermic, meaning it absorbs heat.\n\nIn conclusion, the reaction of CoCl2·6H2O with NaOH is exothermic with a standard enthalpy change of -1677.3 kJ/mol, while the reaction of CoCl2 with NaOH is endothermic with a standard enthalpy change of 482.0 kJ/mol."
