    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of precipitation for the reaction, we first need to determine the limiting reactant and the number of moles of the product (PbI2) formed.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nPb(NO3)2 (aq) + 2NaI (aq) â†’ PbI2 (s) + 2NaNO3 (aq)\n\nFirst, let's find the moles of each reactant:\n\nMoles of Pb(NO3)2 = (0.1 mol/L) * (0.050 L) = 0.005 mol\nMoles of NaI = (0.1 mol/L) * (0.075 L) = 0.0075 mol\n\nNow, we need to determine the limiting reactant. The stoichiometry of the reaction shows that 1 mole of Pb(NO3)2 reacts with 2 moles of NaI. Therefore, we can calculate the amount of NaI required to react with the given amount of Pb(NO3)2:\n\nMoles of NaI required = 0.005 mol * 2 = 0.010 mol\n\nSince we have only 0.0075 mol of NaI, NaI is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow, we can calculate the moles of PbI2 formed:\n\nMoles of PbI2 = (0.0075 mol NaI) * (1 mol PbI2 / 2 mol NaI) = 0.00375 mol\n\nFinally, we can calculate the enthalpy of precipitation using the standard enthalpy of formation of PbI2:\n\nEnthalpy of precipitation = moles of PbI2 * standard enthalpy of formation of PbI2\nEnthalpy of precipitation = (0.00375 mol) * (-360 kJ/mol) = -1.35 kJ\n\nSo, the enthalpy of precipitation for the reaction is -1.35 kJ."
