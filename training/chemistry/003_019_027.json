    "message_2": "To determine the functional group present in a given organic compound using its magnetic resonance spectrum, the student should follow these steps:\n\n1. Obtain the magnetic resonance spectrum: The student should have access to the proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) and/or carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR) spectrum of the compound. These spectra provide information about the chemical environment of hydrogen and carbon atoms in the molecule, respectively.\n\n2. Analyze the chemical shifts: In the 1H NMR spectrum, the position of the peaks (chemical shifts) can provide clues about the functional groups present in the compound. For example, chemical shifts between 9-12 ppm are indicative of aldehyde or carboxylic acid protons, while chemical shifts between 5-6 ppm are indicative of alkene protons. In the 13C NMR spectrum, chemical shifts between 160-180 ppm are indicative of carbonyl carbons (C=O) in aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, and amides.\n\n3. Analyze the peak splitting patterns: In the 1H NMR spectrum, the splitting patterns of the peaks can provide information about the neighboring protons and their connectivity. For example, a triplet peak indicates that the proton is adjacent to two other protons, while a quartet peak indicates that the proton is adjacent to three other protons.\n\n4. Analyze the peak integration: In the 1H NMR spectrum, the integration (area under the peak) is proportional to the number of protons contributing to that peak. This information can help determine the number of protons in a particular chemical environment and further narrow down the possible functional groups.\n\n5. Look for additional evidence: If the compound contains other elements such as nitrogen, phosphorus, or halogens, additional NMR techniques such as 31P NMR or 19F NMR can provide more information about the presence of these elements and their connectivity in the molecule.\n\n6. Combine the information: By combining the information obtained from the chemical shifts, peak splitting patterns, peak integration, and additional NMR techniques, the student should be able to deduce the functional groups present in the compound.\n\n7. Verify with other techniques: If necessary, the student can use other analytical techniques such as infrared (IR) spectroscopy or mass spectrometry to confirm the presence of specific functional groups or the molecular weight of the compound.\n\nBy following these steps, the student should be able to determine the functional group(s) present in the given organic compound using its magnetic resonance spectrum."
