    "message_1": "What is the yield of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene obtained from the reaction between nitrobenzene and chlorine gas when starting with 10 grams of nitrobenzene and excess chlorine gas, given that the reaction has a theoretical yield of 95%?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the yield of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene, we first need to determine the number of moles of nitrobenzene used in the reaction. We can do this by using the molecular weight of nitrobenzene.\n\nThe molecular weight of nitrobenzene (C6H5NO2) is:\nC: 12.01 g/mol × 6 = 72.06 g/mol\nH: 1.01 g/mol × 5 = 5.05 g/mol\nN: 14.01 g/mol × 1 = 14.01 g/mol\nO: 16.00 g/mol × 2 = 32.00 g/mol\nTotal molecular weight = 72.06 + 5.05 + 14.01 + 32.00 = 123.12 g/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of moles of nitrobenzene:\nmoles of nitrobenzene = mass / molecular weight\nmoles of nitrobenzene = 10 g / 123.12 g/mol = 0.0812 moles\n\nThe reaction between nitrobenzene and chlorine gas produces 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene in a 1:1 ratio, so the number of moles of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene produced is equal to the number of moles of nitrobenzene used.\n\nNow, we need to find the mass of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene produced. To do this, we'll use the molecular weight of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene (C6H3Cl2NO2).\n\nThe molecular weight of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene is:\nC: 12.01 g/mol × 6 = 72.06 g/mol\nH: 1.01 g/mol × 3 = 3.03 g/mol\nCl: 35.45 g/mol × 2 = 70.90 g/mol\nN: 14.01 g/mol × 1 = 14.01 g/mol\nO: 16.00 g/mol × 2 = 32.00 g/mol\nTotal molecular weight = 72.06 + 3.03 + 70.90 + 14.01 + 32.00 = 192.00 g/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the mass of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene produced:\nmass of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene = moles × molecular weight\nmass of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene = 0.0812 moles × 192.00 g/mol = 15.59 g\n\nSince the reaction has a theoretical yield of 95%, we need to multiply the mass of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene by the percentage yield to find the actual yield:\n\nactual yield = mass of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene × percentage yield\nactual yield = 15.59 g × 0.95 = 14.81 g\n\nSo, the yield of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene obtained from the reaction is 14.81 grams."
