    "message_2": "The given reaction is a Claisen rearrangement, which is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement involving an allyl vinyl ether. In this case, the allyl vinyl ether is formed by the reaction of the phenol with the allyl alcohol in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst.\n\nThe Claisen rearrangement proceeds through a concerted mechanism, and the major product is formed by the migration of the allyl group to the more substituted carbon of the vinyl ether, leading to the formation of a more stable carbocation.\n\nThe major product of this Claisen rearrangement reaction is:\n\n![Major Product](https://i.imgur.com/5OJH5G0.png)"
