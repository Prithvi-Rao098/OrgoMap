    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic moment of the coordination compound [Fe(H2O)6]Cl3, we first need to identify the oxidation state of the central metal ion (Fe) and the number of unpaired electrons.\n\nThe compound [Fe(H2O)6]Cl3 consists of a hexaaqua iron(III) complex cation ([Fe(H2O)6]³⁺) and three chloride anions (Cl⁻). The oxidation state of Fe in this complex is +3.\n\nNow, let's determine the electron configuration of the Fe³⁺ ion. The atomic number of Fe is 26, and its ground state electron configuration is [Ar] 3d6 4s2. When Fe loses 3 electrons to form the Fe³⁺ ion, its electron configuration becomes [Ar] 3d5.\n\nIn the Fe³⁺ ion, there are 5 unpaired electrons in the 3d orbitals. The magnetic moment (μ) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nμ = √(n(n+2)) μB\n\nwhere n is the number of unpaired electrons and μB is the Bohr magneton (9.274 x 10⁻²⁴ J/T).\n\nFor the Fe³⁺ ion with 5 unpaired electrons:\n\nμ = √(5(5+2)) μB\nμ = √(5(7)) μB\nμ = √35 μB\n\nTherefore, the magnetic moment of the coordination compound [Fe(H2O)6]Cl3 is approximately √35 μB, which is around 5.92 μB."
