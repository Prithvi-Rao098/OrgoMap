    "message_1": "How would the addition of a catalyst affect the equilibrium position of a reaction involving the reduction of copper ions (Cu2+ ) by zinc metal (Zn) in an aqueous solution? Calculate the new equilibrium constant (K c ) after the addition of the catalyst if the initial K c was 1.2 x 10^-5.",
    "message_2": "The addition of a catalyst to a chemical reaction does not affect the equilibrium position or the equilibrium constant (Kc) of the reaction. Catalysts work by lowering the activation energy of the reaction, which speeds up the rate at which the reaction reaches equilibrium. However, the catalyst does not change the relative concentrations of the reactants and products at equilibrium.\n\nIn the case of the reduction of copper ions (Cu2+) by zinc metal (Zn) in an aqueous solution, adding a catalyst would make the reaction reach equilibrium faster, but the equilibrium constant (Kc) would remain the same.\n\nTherefore, the new equilibrium constant (Kc) after the addition of the catalyst would still be 1.2 x 10^-5."
