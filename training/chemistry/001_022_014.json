    "message_2": "When 1,2-dimethylcyclohexane undergoes a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement under acidic conditions, a carbocation rearrangement occurs. The process involves the migration of a methyl group from one carbon to an adjacent carbon, which results in the formation of a more stable carbocation. In this case, the product obtained is 1,1-dimethylcyclohexane."
