    "message_2": "To determine the elemental composition of an organic compound, we need to perform an elemental analysis. Elemental analysis is a technique that allows us to determine the percentage of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen in a given compound. Here's a step-by-step process to solve the problem:\n\n1. Obtain the sample: First, we need to have a sample of the organic compound. The sample should be pure and free from any contaminants.\n\n2. Perform the elemental analysis: There are several methods to perform elemental analysis, such as combustion analysis, mass spectrometry, or X-ray fluorescence. For this example, we will use combustion analysis.\n\n3. Combustion analysis: In this method, the sample is burned in the presence of excess oxygen. The products of combustion are carbon dioxide (CO2), water (H2O), and nitrogen gas (N2). The amounts of these products are measured, and from these measurements, we can calculate the percentage of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen in the sample.\n\n4. Calculate the percentage of each element:\n\n- Carbon: To determine the percentage of carbon, measure the mass of CO2 produced during combustion and use the following formula:\n\n  %C = (mass of C in CO2 / mass of sample) × 100\n\n- Hydrogen: To determine the percentage of hydrogen, measure the mass of H2O produced during combustion and use the following formula:\n\n  %H = (mass of H in H2O / mass of sample) × 100\n\n- Nitrogen: To determine the percentage of nitrogen, measure the mass of N2 produced during combustion and use the following formula:\n\n  %N = (mass of N2 / mass of sample) × 100\n\n5. Determine the percentage of oxygen: Since organic compounds are mainly composed of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen, we can calculate the percentage of oxygen by subtracting the sum of the percentages of the other elements from 100:\n\n  %O = 100 - (%C + %H + %N)\n\nNow, we have the percentage of each element (carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen) present in the given organic compound."
