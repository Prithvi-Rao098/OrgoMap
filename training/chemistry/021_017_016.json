    "message_2": "Hexane (C6H14) is a nonpolar hydrocarbon molecule. The intermolecular forces present in hexane are primarily London dispersion forces (also known as van der Waals forces). These forces arise due to the temporary fluctuations in electron distribution around the molecules, which create temporary dipoles that attract other nearby molecules. Since hexane does not have any polar functional groups or hydrogen bonding capabilities, London dispersion forces are the dominant intermolecular forces present in hexane."
