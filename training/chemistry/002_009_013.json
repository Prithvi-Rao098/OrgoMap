    "message_2": "To find the empirical formula of a compound, we need to determine the mole ratio of the elements present in the compound. We can do this by converting the given mass percentages into moles.\n\n1. Assume 100 grams of the compound. This means we have 54.53 grams of nitrogen (N) and 45.47 grams of chlorine (Cl).\n\n2. Convert grams to moles:\nFor nitrogen: 54.53 g N × (1 mol N / 14.01 g N) = 3.89 moles N\nFor chlorine: 45.47 g Cl × (1 mol Cl / 35.45 g Cl) = 1.28 moles Cl\n\n3. Divide both mole values by the smallest value to get the mole ratio:\nFor nitrogen: 3.89 moles N / 1.28 moles = 3.04 ≈ 3\nFor chlorine: 1.28 moles Cl / 1.28 moles = 1\n\n4. The empirical formula is the simplest whole number ratio of the elements, which in this case is N3Cl1 or simply N3Cl."
