    "message_2": "To determine the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction, we need to use the equilibrium concentrations of the reactants and products. The general expression for Kc for this reaction is:\n\nKc = [SO3]^2 / ([SO2]^2 * [O2])\n\nGiven the equilibrium concentrations of SO2, O2, and SO3 are 0.25 M, 0.15 M, and 0.40 M, respectively, we can plug these values into the Kc expression:\n\nKc = (0.40)^2 / ((0.25)^2 * (0.15))\n\nKc = 0.16 / (0.0625 * 0.15)\n\nKc = 0.16 / 0.009375\n\nKc ≈ 17.07\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for this reaction at the given temperature is approximately 17.07."
