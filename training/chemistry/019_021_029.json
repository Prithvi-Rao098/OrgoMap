    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction, we need to use the following equation:\n\nΔH = q / n\n\nwhere ΔH is the standard enthalpy change, q is the heat released or absorbed during the reaction, and n is the number of moles of the limiting reactant.\n\nFirst, we need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nCaO (s) + H2O (l) → Ca(OH)2 (s)\n\nNow, we need to find the number of moles of calcium oxide (CaO) in 3.2 grams:\n\nMolar mass of CaO = 40.08 g/mol (Ca) + 16.00 g/mol (O) = 56.08 g/mol\n\nn(CaO) = mass / molar mass = 3.2 g / 56.08 g/mol = 0.0571 mol\n\nNext, we need to find the standard enthalpy change for the reaction. The standard enthalpy of formation for calcium oxide (CaO) is -635.1 kJ/mol, and for calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) is -985.2 kJ/mol. Using Hess's Law, we can calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nΔH(reaction) = ΔHf(products) - ΔHf(reactants)\n\nΔH(reaction) = [1 mol × (-985.2 kJ/mol)] - [1 mol × (-635.1 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH(reaction) = -985.2 kJ/mol + 635.1 kJ/mol = -350.1 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat released (q) during the reaction:\n\nq = n × ΔH(reaction) = 0.0571 mol × (-350.1 kJ/mol) = -20.0 kJ\n\nSince the value is negative, it means the reaction is exothermic and releases heat.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nΔH = q / n = -20.0 kJ / 0.0571 mol = -350.1 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the reaction of calcium oxide and water to form calcium hydroxide is -350.1 kJ/mol."
