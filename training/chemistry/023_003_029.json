    "message_2": "To calculate the theoretical yield of nylon-6,6, we first need to determine the limiting reactant in the reaction between adipic acid and hexamethylenediamine. We will do this by comparing the moles of each reactant.\n\n1. Calculate the molar mass of adipic acid (C6H10O4) and hexamethylenediamine (C6H16N2):\nAdipic acid: (6 x 12.01) + (10 x 1.01) + (4 x 16.00) = 146.14 g/mol\nHexamethylenediamine: (6 x 12.01) + (16 x 1.01) + (2 x 14.01) = 116.21 g/mol\n\n2. Calculate the moles of each reactant:\nmoles of adipic acid = 25 g / 146.14 g/mol = 0.171 moles\nmoles of hexamethylenediamine = 35 g / 116.21 g/mol = 0.301 moles\n\n3. Determine the limiting reactant:\nThe reaction between adipic acid and hexamethylenediamine occurs in a 1:1 ratio. Since there are fewer moles of adipic acid, it is the limiting reactant.\n\n4. Calculate the theoretical yield of nylon-6,6:\nThe molar mass of nylon-6,6 (C12H22N2O2) is (12 x 12.01) + (22 x 1.01) + (2 x 14.01) + (2 x 16.00) = 226.32 g/mol. Since the reaction occurs in a 1:1 ratio, the moles of nylon-6,6 produced will be equal to the moles of the limiting reactant (adipic acid).\n\nmoles of nylon-6,6 = 0.171 moles\n\ntheoretical yield of nylon-6,6 = 0.171 moles x 226.32 g/mol = 38.7 g (rounded to one decimal place)\n\nSo, the theoretical yield of nylon-6,6 that can be produced from the reaction of 25 grams of adipic acid and 35 grams of hexamethylenediamine is 38.7 grams, assuming 100% reaction efficiency."
