    "message_1": "The problem for the student to solve could be: \nUsing Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, determine the molecular structure and functional group(s) present in an unknown organic compound with a molecular formula of C4H8O2.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the NMR spectrum of the unknown compound with the molecular formula C4H8O2. The NMR spectrum will provide information about the chemical environment of the hydrogen atoms in the molecule, which can help us determine the molecular structure and functional groups present.\n\n1. First, we need to consider the possible functional groups that could be present in the compound. With the molecular formula C4H8O2, we can have the following possibilities:\n   a. An ester (R-COO-R')\n   b. An acid anhydride (R-CO-O-CO-R')\n   c. Two alcohol groups (R-OH and R'-OH)\n   d. An acid and an alcohol group (R-COOH and R'-OH)\n\n2. Next, we need to analyze the NMR spectrum. We should look for the following key features:\n   a. Chemical shifts: The position of the peaks in the spectrum, which can give us information about the type of functional group(s) present.\n   b. Integration: The area under each peak, which is proportional to the number of hydrogen atoms in that chemical environment.\n   c. Multiplicity: The splitting pattern of the peaks, which can provide information about the neighboring hydrogen atoms.\n\n3. Based on the NMR spectrum, we can start to piece together the molecular structure of the compound. For example, if we see a peak around 10-12 ppm, it could indicate the presence of a carboxylic acid group (R-COOH). Similarly, a peak around 3.5-4.5 ppm could suggest an ester group (R-COO-R') or an alcohol group (R-OH).\n\n4. We can also use the integration values to determine the ratio of hydrogen atoms in different chemical environments. For instance, if we have a peak with an integration value of 2 and another peak with an integration value of 6, it means that there are two hydrogen atoms in one chemical environment and six hydrogen atoms in another chemical environment.\n\n5. Finally, we can use the multiplicity of the peaks to determine the connectivity of the hydrogen atoms in the molecule. For example, a triplet peak suggests that the hydrogen atom is adjacent to two other hydrogen atoms.\n\nBy analyzing the NMR spectrum and considering the possible functional groups, we can determine the molecular structure and functional group(s) present in the unknown organic compound with the molecular formula C4H8O2."
