    "message_2": "To calculate the dipole moment of CHCl3 (chloroform), we need to consider the individual bond dipoles and their vector sum. Chloroform has a tetrahedral molecular geometry, with the carbon atom at the center and the hydrogen and three chlorine atoms surrounding it.\n\nThe bond dipole moment is given by the formula:\n\nμ = Q × d\n\nwhere μ is the bond dipole moment, Q is the charge difference between the two atoms in the bond, and d is the bond length.\n\nThe bond dipole moment of the C-H bond is smaller than that of the C-Cl bond due to the smaller electronegativity difference between carbon and hydrogen. The three C-Cl bond dipoles are larger and have a greater influence on the overall dipole moment of the molecule.\n\nTo find the net dipole moment, we need to find the vector sum of the individual bond dipoles. Due to the tetrahedral geometry, the angle between the C-Cl bonds is approximately 109.5°. The C-H bond dipole and one of the C-Cl bond dipoles will be in the same plane, while the other two C-Cl bond dipoles will be in a plane perpendicular to the first one.\n\nUsing vector addition, we can calculate the net dipole moment:\n\nμ_net = √(μ_CH² + 3μ_CCl² + 2μ_CH × μ_CCl × cos(109.5°))\n\nUnfortunately, without the specific values for the bond lengths and charge differences, we cannot provide a numerical value for the dipole moment of CHCl3. However, it is known to be a polar molecule due to the presence of polar C-Cl bonds and the tetrahedral geometry."
