    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy change for the sublimation of iodine (I2), we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH = ΔG + TΔS\n\nwhere ΔH is the standard enthalpy change, ΔG is the standard Gibbs free energy change, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ΔS is the standard entropy change.\n\nWe are given the standard entropies for solid I2 (116 J/mol K), gaseous I2 (260 J/mol K), and the sublimation of I2 (62.44 J/mol K). We can calculate the standard entropy change (ΔS) for the sublimation process using the following equation:\n\nΔS = S_gas - S_solid\n\nΔS = 260 J/mol K - 116 J/mol K\nΔS = 144 J/mol K\n\nNow, we can use the given sublimation entropy (62.44 J/mol K) to calculate the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) using the equation:\n\nΔG = TΔS_sublimation\n\nΔG = (298 K)(62.44 J/mol K)\nΔG = 18606.32 J/mol\n\nFinally, we can use the calculated values of ΔG and ΔS to find the standard enthalpy change (ΔH) for the sublimation of iodine:\n\nΔH = ΔG + TΔS\n\nΔH = 18606.32 J/mol + (298 K)(144 J/mol K)\nΔH = 18606.32 J/mol + 42912 J/mol\nΔH = 61518.32 J/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the sublimation of iodine (I2) at 298 K and 1 atm pressure is approximately 61.52 kJ/mol."
