    "message_2": "To determine the bond order of O2 from molecular orbital theory, we need to consider the number of valence electrons for oxygen and the energy levels of the molecular orbitals.\n\nOxygen has 6 valence electrons, so O2 has a total of 12 valence electrons. According to molecular orbital theory, these electrons will fill the molecular orbitals in order of increasing energy.\n\nThe molecular orbitals for O2 are as follows:\n1. σ2s (2 electrons)\n2. σ*2s (2 electrons)\n3. σ2p (2 electrons)\n4. π2p (4 electrons, 2 in each degenerate orbital)\n5. π*2p (2 electrons, 1 in each degenerate orbital)\n\nNow, we can calculate the bond order using the formula:\n\nBond order = (number of electrons in bonding orbitals - number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\n\nBond order = (2 + 2 + 4 - 2) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3\n\nTherefore, the bond order of O2 is 2."
