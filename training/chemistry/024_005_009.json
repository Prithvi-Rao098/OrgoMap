    "message_2": "To develop a process for the purification of an impure sample of sodium chloride (NaCl) using recrystallization and determine the percent yield of the purified compound, follow these steps:\n\n1. Weigh the impure sample of sodium chloride: Record the initial mass of the impure NaCl sample (m1) using an analytical balance.\n\n2. Dissolve the impure sample in water: Place the impure NaCl sample in a beaker and add a minimum amount of distilled water. Heat the mixture gently while stirring until the NaCl dissolves completely. The impurities that are insoluble in water will remain undissolved.\n\n3. Filter the solution: Perform a gravity filtration using filter paper and a funnel to separate the insoluble impurities from the NaCl solution. Collect the filtrate (the liquid that passes through the filter paper) in a clean beaker or Erlenmeyer flask.\n\n4. Evaporate the solvent: Heat the filtrate gently to evaporate the water and concentrate the NaCl solution. Be careful not to evaporate all the water, as this may cause the impurities to dissolve back into the solution.\n\n5. Cool the solution to induce recrystallization: Remove the concentrated NaCl solution from the heat source and allow it to cool slowly to room temperature. As the solution cools, the solubility of NaCl decreases, and pure NaCl crystals will begin to form.\n\n6. Collect the purified NaCl crystals: Once the solution has reached room temperature, place the beaker or flask in an ice bath to further promote crystal formation. After a sufficient amount of time, filter the mixture using vacuum filtration to separate the purified NaCl crystals from the remaining liquid.\n\n7. Dry the purified crystals: Transfer the purified NaCl crystals to a clean watch glass or a piece of filter paper and allow them to air dry or use a gentle heat source to remove any remaining traces of water.\n\n8. Weigh the purified NaCl crystals: Once the purified NaCl crystals are completely dry, weigh them using an analytical balance and record the mass (m2).\n\n9. Calculate the percent yield: To determine the percent yield of the purified NaCl, use the following formula:\n\nPercent Yield = (m2 / m1) Ã— 100\n\nwhere m1 is the initial mass of the impure NaCl sample and m2 is the mass of the purified NaCl crystals.\n\nThis process should result in a purified sample of sodium chloride with a known percent yield, indicating the effectiveness of the recrystallization process in removing impurities."
