    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction, we need to use the expression for Kc and the equilibrium concentrations of the reactants and products.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation is:\n\n2NOCl(g) ⇌ 2NO(g) + Cl2(g)\n\nThe expression for Kc is:\n\nKc = [NO]^2 [Cl2] / [NOCl]^2\n\nGiven the equilibrium concentrations:\n\n[NOCl] = 0.25 M\n[NO] = 0.10 M\n[Cl2] = 0.10 M\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Kc expression:\n\nKc = (0.10)^2 * (0.10) / (0.25)^2\n\nKc = 0.01 * 0.10 / 0.0625\n\nKc = 0.001 / 0.0625\n\nKc ≈ 0.016\n\nThe equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction is approximately 0.016."
