    "message_2": "To find the molarity of the base solution, we can use the concept of stoichiometry and the equation:\n\nmoles of acid = moles of base\n\nSince the neutralization reaction between an acid and a base is a 1:1 ratio, we can use the volume and molarity of the acid to find the moles of acid and then use the volume of the base to find the molarity of the base.\n\nFirst, let's find the moles of hydrochloric acid (HCl):\n\nmoles of HCl = volume of HCl (in L) × molarity of HCl\nmoles of HCl = 0.025 L × 0.1 M\nmoles of HCl = 0.0025 moles\n\nNow, we know that the moles of acid equal the moles of base, so:\n\nmoles of base = 0.0025 moles\n\nNext, we can find the molarity of the base solution using the volume of the base:\n\nmolarity of base = moles of base / volume of base (in L)\nmolarity of base = 0.0025 moles / 0.035 L\nmolarity of base ≈ 0.0714 M\n\nSo, the molarity of the base solution is approximately 0.0714 M."
