    "message_2": "The balanced chemical equation for the preparation of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene from nitrobenzene and chlorine gas is:\n\nC6H5NO2 + 2 Cl2 â†’ C6H3Cl2NO2 + 2 HCl\n\nTo calculate the theoretical yield, we first need to determine the limiting reactant. We will do this by calculating the moles of each reactant and comparing their mole ratios.\n\nMolar mass of nitrobenzene (C6H5NO2) = 123.11 g/mol\nMolar mass of chlorine gas (Cl2) = 70.90 g/mol\nMolar mass of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene (C6H3Cl2NO2) = 202.00 g/mol\n\nMoles of nitrobenzene = 10 g / 123.11 g/mol = 0.0812 mol\nMoles of chlorine gas = 20 g / 70.90 g/mol = 0.282 mol\n\nNow, we will compare the mole ratios of the reactants:\n\nMole ratio of nitrobenzene to chlorine gas = 0.0812 mol / 0.282 mol = 0.288\n\nSince the balanced equation requires a 1:2 ratio of nitrobenzene to chlorine gas, and the actual ratio is less than that, nitrobenzene is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow, we can calculate the theoretical yield of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene:\n\nMoles of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene = 0.0812 mol nitrobenzene * (1 mol 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene / 1 mol nitrobenzene) = 0.0812 mol\n\nTheoretical yield = 0.0812 mol * 202.00 g/mol = 16.4 g\n\nSo, the theoretical yield of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene is 16.4 g."
