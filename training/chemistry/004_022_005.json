    "message_1": "What is the concentration of chloride ions in a 0.1 M solution of hydrochloric acid, if the potential difference between two silver electrodes in contact with the solution is measured to be 0.22 V at 25Â°C? The standard reduction potential for the silver/silver chloride electrode is 0.22 V.",
    "message_2": "In a 0.1 M solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl), the concentration of chloride ions (Cl-) is equal to the concentration of HCl because HCl dissociates completely into H+ and Cl- ions in aqueous solution. Therefore, the concentration of chloride ions in the solution is 0.1 M.\n\nThe potential difference between the two silver electrodes in contact with the solution is measured to be 0.22 V, which is equal to the standard reduction potential for the silver/silver chloride electrode. Since the measured potential difference is equal to the standard reduction potential, this indicates that the solution is at equilibrium with respect to the silver/silver chloride electrode reaction.\n\nAt equilibrium, the concentration of chloride ions in the solution remains constant, so the concentration of chloride ions in the 0.1 M solution of hydrochloric acid is 0.1 M."
