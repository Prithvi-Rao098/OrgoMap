    "message_1": "Calculate the standard electrode potential of the copper electrode if the standard electrode potential of the zinc electrode is -0.76 V and the standard cell potential is 1.10 V for the cell reaction: Zn(s) + Cu2+(aq) → Zn2+(aq) + Cu(s). Use the equation Eºcell=Eº cathode - Eº anode where Eºcell is the standard cell potential, Eºcathode is the standard potential for the reduction half-reaction, and Eºanode is the standard potential for the oxidation half-reaction.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard electrode potential of the copper electrode, we can use the equation Eºcell = Eºcathode - Eºanode. We are given the standard electrode potential of the zinc electrode (Eºanode) as -0.76 V and the standard cell potential (Eºcell) as 1.10 V.\n\nWe can rearrange the equation to solve for Eºcathode (the standard electrode potential of the copper electrode):\n\nEºcathode = Eºcell + Eºanode\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nEºcathode = 1.10 V + (-0.76 V)\n\nEºcathode = 0.34 V\n\nSo, the standard electrode potential of the copper electrode is 0.34 V."
