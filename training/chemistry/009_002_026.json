    "message_2": "To calculate the half-life of thorium-234, we can use the radioactive decay formula:\n\nA = A₀ * (1/2)^(t/T)\n\nWhere:\nA = final activity\nA₀ = initial activity\nt = time elapsed\nT = half-life\n\nWe are given:\nA₀ = 3000 Bq\nA = 750 Bq\nt = 21 hours\n\nWe need to find T (half-life).\n\nFirst, let's rearrange the formula to solve for T:\n\nT = (t * log(1/2)) / log(A/A₀)\n\nNow, plug in the given values:\n\nT = (21 * log(1/2)) / log(750/3000)\n\nT = (21 * log(0.5)) / log(0.25)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nT = (21 * (-0.30103)) / (-0.60206)\n\nT ≈ 21 / 2\n\nT ≈ 10.5 hours\n\nThe half-life of thorium-234 is approximately 10.5 hours."
