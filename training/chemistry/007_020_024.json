    "message_2": "To develop a topical medication for psoriasis that penetrates the skin efficiently and has a prolonged release time, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the active ingredients: Research and select the most effective active ingredients for treating psoriasis, such as corticosteroids, vitamin D analogs, or retinoids. These ingredients should have a proven track record of reducing inflammation, slowing skin cell growth, and improving the overall appearance of the skin.\n\n2. Optimize the formulation: Develop a formulation that allows the active ingredients to penetrate the skin efficiently. This may involve using penetration enhancers, such as liposomes, microemulsions, or nanoparticles, which can help the active ingredients cross the skin barrier and reach the target site.\n\n3. Prolonged release system: Incorporate a controlled-release system into the formulation to ensure a sustained release of the active ingredients over time. This can be achieved by using hydrogels, microspheres, or polymeric matrices that release the active ingredients slowly and steadily, reducing the need for frequent applications.\n\n4. Test the formulation: Conduct in vitro and in vivo tests to evaluate the skin penetration, release profile, and overall effectiveness of the formulation. This will help determine if the formulation is successful in delivering the active ingredients to the target site and providing the desired therapeutic effect.\n\n5. Stability and safety: Ensure that the formulation is stable over time and does not cause any adverse reactions or side effects. This may involve conducting stability tests and assessing the safety of the formulation through clinical trials.\n\n6. Optimize the vehicle: Select an appropriate vehicle for the formulation, such as a cream, gel, or ointment, that is easy to apply, non-greasy, and cosmetically acceptable to patients. The vehicle should also be compatible with the active ingredients and the controlled-release system.\n\n7. Patient compliance: Develop a user-friendly packaging and application system that encourages patient compliance. This may involve creating a convenient applicator or dispenser that makes it easy for patients to apply the medication as directed.\n\n8. Regulatory approval: Obtain regulatory approval for the new topical medication by submitting the necessary documentation and data to the relevant health authorities, such as the FDA or EMA.\n\nBy following these steps, we can develop a topical medication for psoriasis that penetrates the skin efficiently, has a prolonged release time, and reduces the number of applications required per day, ultimately improving the treatment's effectiveness and patient compliance."
