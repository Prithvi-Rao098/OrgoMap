    "message_2": "To find the rate constant for the free radical polymerization of vinyl acetate at 60°C, we can use the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk = Ae^(-Ea/RT)\n\nwhere:\nk = rate constant\nA = frequency factor (2.2 x 10^10 min^-1)\nEa = activation energy (34.6 kJ/mol)\nR = gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\nT = temperature in Kelvin (60°C + 273.15 = 333.15 K)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the activation energy from kJ/mol to J/mol:\n\nEa = 34.6 kJ/mol * (1000 J/1 kJ) = 34600 J/mol\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk = (2.2 x 10^10 min^-1) * e^(-34600 J/mol / (8.314 J/mol·K * 333.15 K))\n\nk = (2.2 x 10^10 min^-1) * e^(-34600 J/mol / (2770.61 J/mol))\n\nk = (2.2 x 10^10 min^-1) * e^(-12.49)\n\nk ≈ (2.2 x 10^10 min^-1) * 3.47 x 10^(-6)\n\nk ≈ 7.63 x 10^4 min^-1\n\nThe rate constant for the free radical polymerization of vinyl acetate at 60°C is approximately 7.63 x 10^4 min^-1."
