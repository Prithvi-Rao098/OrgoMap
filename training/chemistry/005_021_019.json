    "message_2": "RNA splicing is a crucial process in the maturation of pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) into mature messenger RNA (mRNA) in cells. This process involves the removal of non-coding sequences called introns and the joining of coding sequences called exons. The mature mRNA is then translated into proteins. The process of RNA splicing differs between eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells due to their structural and functional differences.\n\nIn eukaryotic cells, RNA splicing occurs in the nucleus after transcription. Eukaryotic genes contain both introns and exons, and the pre-mRNA must undergo splicing to remove the introns and join the exons together. This process is facilitated by a large complex called the spliceosome, which is composed of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and other associated proteins. The spliceosome recognizes specific sequences at the exon-intron boundaries, called splice sites, and catalyzes the splicing reaction. RNA splicing factors, such as serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), play essential roles in the regulation and accuracy of splicing. They bind to specific sequences within the pre-mRNA and influence splice site selection, ensuring that the correct exons are joined together.\n\nIn prokaryotic cells, RNA splicing is less common and less complex than in eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotes, such as bacteria, generally do not have introns in their genes, and their mRNA is often polycistronic, meaning it contains multiple coding regions for different proteins. As a result, prokaryotic mRNA does not typically require extensive splicing. However, some prokaryotic genes do contain self-splicing introns, called group I or group II introns. These introns can catalyze their own excision from the mRNA without the need for a spliceosome or additional splicing factors. Instead, they rely on their secondary and tertiary RNA structures to facilitate the splicing reaction.\n\nIn summary, RNA splicing differs between eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells in several ways:\n\n1. Eukaryotic cells have a more complex and prevalent splicing process due to the presence of introns in their genes, while prokaryotic cells generally have fewer introns and less need for splicing.\n2. Eukaryotic RNA splicing is facilitated by the spliceosome and involves the participation of various RNA splicing factors, such as SR proteins and hnRNPs, which ensure accurate splice site selection and regulation. In contrast, prokaryotic RNA splicing is often self-catalyzed by the introns themselves and does not require additional splicing factors.\n3. Eukaryotic RNA splicing occurs in the nucleus, while prokaryotic cells, which lack a nucleus, carry out any necessary splicing within the cytoplasm."
