    "message_1": "What are the equilibrium concentrations of reactants and products at a temperature of 300 K and a pressure of 1 atm for the following reaction: \n\nA (g) + B (g) ↔ 2C (g) \n\nwhere A has an initial concentration of 0.1 M, B has an initial concentration of 0.2 M, and C has an initial concentration of 0 M. The equilibrium constant, Kc, is 4.8 x 10^-3.",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium concentrations, we can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table and use the equilibrium constant expression.\n\nInitial concentrations:\n[A] = 0.1 M\n[B] = 0.2 M\n[C] = 0 M\n\nChange in concentrations:\nLet x be the change in concentration for A and B, and 2x for C.\n\nEquilibrium concentrations:\n[A] = 0.1 - x\n[B] = 0.2 - x\n[C] = 2x\n\nNow, we can write the equilibrium constant expression using Kc and the equilibrium concentrations:\n\nKc = [C]^2 / ([A] * [B])\n\n4.8 x 10^-3 = (2x)^2 / ((0.1 - x) * (0.2 - x))\n\nSolving for x:\n\n(4.8 x 10^-3) * ((0.1 - x) * (0.2 - x)) = (2x)^2\n\nAfter solving for x, we get:\n\nx ≈ 0.014\n\nNow, we can find the equilibrium concentrations:\n\n[A] = 0.1 - x ≈ 0.1 - 0.014 ≈ 0.086 M\n[B] = 0.2 - x ≈ 0.2 - 0.014 ≈ 0.186 M\n[C] = 2x ≈ 2 * 0.014 ≈ 0.028 M\n\nSo, the equilibrium concentrations are approximately:\n[A] ≈ 0.086 M\n[B] ≈ 0.186 M\n[C] ≈ 0.028 M"
