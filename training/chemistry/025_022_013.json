    "message_2": "1. Combustion: Combustion is a chemical reaction that occurs between a fuel and an oxidizing agent, usually producing heat and light in the form of a flame. In everyday life, combustion is used for cooking, heating, and transportation (e.g., burning of natural gas, wood, or gasoline).\n\n   Equation: CxHy + O2 → CO2 + H2O\n\n2. Acid-Base Neutralization: This reaction occurs when an acid reacts with a base, resulting in the formation of water and a salt. In everyday life, this reaction is used in antacid tablets to neutralize excess stomach acid and in cleaning products to remove stains and dirt.\n\n   Equation: HA + BOH → BA + H2O\n\n3. Photosynthesis: This is the process by which plants convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. Photosynthesis is essential for life on Earth, as it provides oxygen and serves as the basis for the food chain.\n\n   Equation: 6CO2 + 6H2O + sunlight → C6H12O6 + 6O2\n\n4. Cellular Respiration: This is the process by which living organisms convert glucose and oxygen into carbon dioxide, water, and energy. Cellular respiration is essential for life, as it provides energy for all biological processes.\n\n   Equation: C6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O + energy\n\n5. Fermentation: Fermentation is a metabolic process that converts sugar to acids, gases, or alcohol. In everyday life, fermentation is used in the production of bread, yogurt, cheese, and alcoholic beverages.\n\n   Equation (alcoholic fermentation): C6H12O6 → 2C2H5OH + 2CO2\n\n6. Saponification: This is the process of making soap by reacting fats or oils with a strong base, such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. The reaction produces soap and glycerol.\n\n   Equation: Fat + NaOH → Soap + Glycerol\n\n7. Rusting: Rusting is an oxidation reaction that occurs when iron reacts with oxygen and water to form hydrated iron(III) oxide, commonly known as rust. This reaction is a common problem in everyday life, causing damage to metal structures and objects.\n\n   Equation: 4Fe + 3O2 + 6H2O → 4Fe(OH)3\n\n8. Baking soda and vinegar reaction: This reaction occurs when sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) reacts with acetic acid (vinegar) to produce carbon dioxide gas, water, and sodium acetate. This reaction is commonly used in science experiments, cleaning, and as a natural leavening agent in baking.\n\n   Equation: NaHCO3 + CH3COOH → CH3COONa + H2O + CO2\n\n9. Formation of esters: Esters are formed by the reaction between an alcohol and a carboxylic acid. This reaction is used in the production of fragrances, flavorings, and solvents.\n\n   Equation: RCOOH + R'OH → RCOOR' + H2O\n\n10. Hydrogen peroxide decomposition: Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) decomposes into water and oxygen gas. This reaction is used in healthcare for disinfection and wound cleaning, as well as in hair bleaching and teeth whitening products.\n\n   Equation: 2H2O2 → 2H2O + O2"
