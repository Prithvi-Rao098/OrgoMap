    "message_2": "To determine the mass of copper deposited on the cathode during the electrolysis of a solution of CuSO₄, we can use Faraday's laws of electrolysis. The first law states that the mass of a substance deposited at an electrode is directly proportional to the amount of charge passed through the electrolyte.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total charge passed through the electrolyte. The charge (Q) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nQ = I × t\n\nwhere I is the current (2 A) and t is the time (3 hours).\n\nSince the time is given in hours, we need to convert it to seconds:\n\n3 hours × (3600 seconds / 1 hour) = 10800 seconds\n\nNow, we can calculate the charge:\n\nQ = 2 A × 10800 s = 21600 Coulombs\n\nNext, we need to find the number of moles of electrons passed through the electrolyte. We can use the formula:\n\nn = Q / (F × z)\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of electrons, Q is the charge, F is Faraday's constant (96485 C/mol), and z is the charge of the ion (for copper, z = 2, as it forms Cu²⁺ ions).\n\nn = 21600 C / (96485 C/mol × 2) = 0.1119 mol\n\nNow that we have the number of moles of electrons, we can find the number of moles of copper deposited on the cathode. Since the reaction is Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu, the number of moles of copper deposited is equal to half the number of moles of electrons:\n\nmoles of Cu = 0.1119 mol / 2 = 0.05595 mol\n\nFinally, we can find the mass of copper deposited by multiplying the number of moles by the atomic weight of copper:\n\nmass of Cu = 0.05595 mol × 63.5 g/mol = 3.553 g\n\nTherefore, the mass of copper deposited on the cathode during the electrolysis of a solution of CuSO₄ using a current of 2 A for 3 hours is approximately 3.553 grams."
