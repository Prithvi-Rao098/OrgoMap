    "message_2": "To find the rate constant (k) of a first-order reaction, we can use the integrated rate law for first-order reactions:\n\nln([A]t / [A]0) = -kt\n\nwhere [A]t is the concentration of the reactant at time t, [A]0 is the initial concentration of the reactant, and t is the time elapsed.\n\nGiven the problem, we have:\n\n[A]t = 0.3 M\n[A]0 = 1.2 M\nt = 45 minutes = 45 * 60 seconds = 2700 seconds\n\nNow we can plug these values into the integrated rate law equation:\n\nln(0.3 / 1.2) = -k * 2700\n\nSolve for k:\n\nk = - (ln(0.3 / 1.2) / 2700)\n\nk ≈ 0.000403 s⁻¹\n\nThe rate constant for this first-order reaction is approximately 0.000403 s⁻¹."
