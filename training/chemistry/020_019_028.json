    "message_2": "When the pH is decreased from 8.0 to 6.0, the formation of a complex ion containing copper and ammonia is expected to be less favorable. To understand this, we need to consider the chemical reactions involved in the formation of the complex ion.\n\nCopper(II) ions (Cu²⁺) can react with ammonia (NH₃) to form a complex ion called tetraamminecopper(II) ion ([Cu(NH₃)₄]²⁺). The overall reaction can be represented as:\n\nCu²⁺(aq) + 4NH₃(aq) ⇌ [Cu(NH₃)₄]²⁺(aq)\n\nHowever, this reaction is actually a stepwise process, involving the formation of intermediate complex ions:\n\n1) Cu²⁺(aq) + NH₃(aq) ⇌ [Cu(NH₃)]²⁺(aq)\n2) [Cu(NH₃)]²⁺(aq) + NH₃(aq) ⇌ [Cu(NH₃)₂]²⁺(aq)\n3) [Cu(NH₃)₂]²⁺(aq) + NH₃(aq) ⇌ [Cu(NH₃)₃]²⁺(aq)\n4) [Cu(NH₃)₃]²⁺(aq) + NH₃(aq) ⇌ [Cu(NH₃)₄]²⁺(aq)\n\nNow, let's consider the effect of pH on this reaction. Ammonia (NH₃) is a weak base, and it can react with water to form ammonium ions (NH₄⁺) and hydroxide ions (OH⁻):\n\nNH₃(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ NH₄⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n\nWhen the pH is decreased from 8.0 to 6.0, the concentration of H⁺ ions in the solution increases. This increase in H⁺ ions will cause the equilibrium of the above reaction to shift to the left, decreasing the concentration of NH₃ and increasing the concentration of NH₄⁺:\n\nH⁺(aq) + NH₃(aq) ⇌ NH₄⁺(aq)\n\nAs a result, there will be less NH₃ available to form the complex ion with Cu²⁺. This will cause the equilibria of the stepwise complex formation reactions to shift to the left, favoring the formation of the less complexed species (e.g., Cu²⁺, [Cu(NH₃)]²⁺, etc.). Consequently, the formation of the tetraamminecopper(II) ion ([Cu(NH₃)₄]²⁺) will be less favorable at pH 6.0 compared to pH 8.0."
