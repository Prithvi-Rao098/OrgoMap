    "message_2": "The equilibrium constant for the reaction between ethanoic acid (CH3COOH) and water (H2O) can be determined using the dissociation constant (Ka) for ethanoic acid. The reaction can be written as:\n\nCH3COOH + H2O ⇌ CH3COO- + H3O+\n\nThe dissociation constant (Ka) is given as 1.8 x 10^-5 at 25°C. In this case, the Ka value is the equilibrium constant for the reaction, as it represents the ratio of the concentrations of the products to the reactants at equilibrium. Therefore, the equilibrium constant (K) for the reaction between ethanoic acid and water is:\n\nK = Ka = 1.8 x 10^-5"
