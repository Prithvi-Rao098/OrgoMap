    "message_2": "The metal center in the active site of hemoglobin is iron (Fe). The coordination geometry of the iron center is octahedral, and the coordination number is 6. In this arrangement, the iron is coordinated to four nitrogen atoms from the porphyrin ring, one nitrogen atom from the imidazole side chain of a histidine residue, and one oxygen molecule (O2) when it binds to the heme group."
