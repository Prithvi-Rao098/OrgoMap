    "message_1": "What is the standard enthalpy change of reaction for the combustion of liquid ethanol (C₂H₅OH) at standard conditions, given that the balanced chemical equation is:\n\nC₂H₅OH(l) + 3O₂(g) → 2CO₂(g) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThe standard enthalpies of formation for liquid ethanol, carbon dioxide, and liquid water are -277.7 kJ/mol, -393.5 kJ/mol, and -285.9 kJ/mol, respectively.",
    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy change of reaction (ΔH°) for the combustion of liquid ethanol, we can use the following formula:\n\nΔH° = Σ ΔH°f(products) - Σ ΔH°f(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH°f represents the standard enthalpy of formation for each substance.\n\nFor the products, we have 2 moles of CO₂ and 3 moles of H₂O:\n\nΣ ΔH°f(products) = (2 mol CO₂ × -393.5 kJ/mol CO₂) + (3 mol H₂O × -285.9 kJ/mol H₂O)\nΣ ΔH°f(products) = (-787.0 kJ) + (-857.7 kJ) = -1644.7 kJ\n\nFor the reactants, we have 1 mole of C₂H₅OH and 3 moles of O₂. Since the standard enthalpy of formation for O₂ is zero (it is in its elemental form), we only need to consider the enthalpy of formation for C₂H₅OH:\n\nΣ ΔH°f(reactants) = (1 mol C₂H₅OH × -277.7 kJ/mol C₂H₅OH) + (3 mol O₂ × 0 kJ/mol O₂)\nΣ ΔH°f(reactants) = -277.7 kJ\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard enthalpy change of reaction:\n\nΔH° = Σ ΔH°f(products) - Σ ΔH°f(reactants)\nΔH° = (-1644.7 kJ) - (-277.7 kJ)\nΔH° = -1367.0 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change of reaction for the combustion of liquid ethanol at standard conditions is -1367.0 kJ."
