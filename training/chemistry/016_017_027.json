    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy of oxidation of methane gas to carbon dioxide gas, we need to consider the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nCH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l)\n\nNext, we'll use Hess's Law, which states that the enthalpy change for a reaction is the sum of the enthalpy changes for the individual steps. In this case, we can break down the reaction into two steps:\n\n1. Formation of CO2(g) from CH4(g) and O2(g)\n2. Formation of 2 H2O(l) from CH4(g) and O2(g)\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the overall reaction (ΔH°rxn) can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nΔH°rxn = Σ [ΔHf°(products)] - Σ [ΔHf°(reactants)]\n\nFor the formation of CO2(g):\n\nΔHf°[CO2(g)] = -393.5 kJ/mol\n\nFor the formation of 2 H2O(l), we need the enthalpy of formation for H2O(l):\n\nΔHf°[H2O(l)] = -285.8 kJ/mol (from reference data)\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the overall reaction:\n\nΔH°rxn = [1 × (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 × (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [1 × (-74.6 kJ/mol) + 0 × O2(g)]\n\nΔH°rxn = (-393.5 - 571.6 + 74.6) kJ/mol\n\nΔH°rxn = -890.5 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy of oxidation of methane gas (CH4(g)) to carbon dioxide gas (CO2(g)) at 298K and 1 atm pressure is -890.5 kJ/mol."
