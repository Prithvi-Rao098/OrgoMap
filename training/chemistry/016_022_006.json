    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the isomerization reaction of hexene from trans-hexene to cis-hexene, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH = ΔH(products) - ΔH(reactants)\n\nIn this case, the reactant is trans-hexene, and the product is cis-hexene. The standard enthalpy of formation values are given as -123 kJ/mol for trans-hexene and -130 kJ/mol for cis-hexene.\n\nΔH = (-130 kJ/mol) - (-123 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH = -130 + 123\n\nΔH = -7 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change involved in the isomerization reaction of hexene from trans-hexene to cis-hexene is -7 kJ/mol."
