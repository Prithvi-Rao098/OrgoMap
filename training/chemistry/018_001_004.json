    "message_2": "To determine the rate law for the reaction, we need to analyze the data provided and find the relationship between the concentrations of the reactants and the initial rate of the reaction. The general rate law equation is:\n\nrate = k [H2O2]^m [I-]^n\n\nwhere k is the rate constant, m and n are the orders of the reaction with respect to H2O2 and I-, respectively.\n\nFirst, let's examine the effect of changing the concentration of I- while keeping the concentration of H2O2 constant. Compare Experiment 1 and 2:\n\nExperiment 1:\n[H2O2] = 0.01 M, [I-] = 0.02 M, rate = 3.2 x 10^-4 M/s\n\nExperiment 2:\n[H2O2] = 0.01 M, [I-] = 0.04 M, rate = 6.5 x 10^-4 M/s\n\nWhen the concentration of I- doubles, the rate also approximately doubles (6.5/3.2 â‰ˆ 2). This suggests that the reaction is first order with respect to I- (n = 1).\n\nNow, let's examine the effect of changing the concentration of H2O2 while keeping the concentration of I- constant. Compare Experiment 1 and 3:\n\nExperiment 1:\n[H2O2] = 0.01 M, [I-] = 0.02 M, rate = 3.2 x 10^-4 M/s\n\nExperiment 3:\n[H2O2] = 0.02 M, [I-] = 0.02 M, rate = 6.4 x 10^-4 M/s\n\nWhen the concentration of H2O2 doubles, the rate also doubles (6.4/3.2 = 2). This suggests that the reaction is first order with respect to H2O2 (m = 1).\n\nTherefore, the rate law for the reaction is:\n\nrate = k [H2O2]^1 [I-]^1\n\nor\n\nrate = k [H2O2] [I-]"
