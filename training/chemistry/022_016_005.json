    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question for the student to solve:\n\nIf 2.5 moles of methane (CH4) reacts with excess oxygen to produce carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O), and the enthalpy change for the combustion reaction is -802.3 kJ/mol, what is the total amount of heat energy released by the reaction?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the total amount of heat energy released by the reaction, we can use the following formula:\n\nq = n × ΔH\n\nwhere q is the heat energy released, n is the number of moles of methane, and ΔH is the enthalpy change for the combustion reaction.\n\nGiven:\nn = 2.5 moles of methane (CH4)\nΔH = -802.3 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nq = (2.5 moles) × (-802.3 kJ/mol)\n\nq = -2005.75 kJ\n\nSo, the total amount of heat energy released by the reaction is -2005.75 kJ. The negative sign indicates that the reaction is exothermic, meaning it releases heat energy."
