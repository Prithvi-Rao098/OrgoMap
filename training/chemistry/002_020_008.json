    "message_2": "To identify the type of inorganic solid (ionic, covalent, or metallic) based on their physical properties and bonding characteristics, you can consider the following factors:\n\n1. Ionic solids:\n   - Bonding: Ionic solids consist of positively charged cations and negatively charged anions held together by strong electrostatic forces (ionic bonds).\n   - Physical properties: These solids usually have high melting and boiling points, are hard and brittle, and are good conductors of electricity when dissolved in water or melted. They are generally soluble in polar solvents like water but insoluble in nonpolar solvents.\n\n2. Covalent (or molecular) solids:\n   - Bonding: Covalent solids are formed by atoms sharing electrons, creating strong covalent bonds between the atoms. These solids can be further divided into two categories: covalent network solids and molecular solids.\n   - Covalent network solids: These solids consist of a continuous network of covalently bonded atoms. Examples include diamond, quartz (SiO2), and silicon carbide (SiC).\n       - Physical properties: Covalent network solids have very high melting and boiling points, are extremely hard and rigid, and are poor conductors of electricity.\n   - Molecular solids: These solids consist of discrete molecules held together by weak intermolecular forces, such as van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonding, or dipole-dipole interactions. Examples include ice (H2O), dry ice (CO2), and iodine (I2).\n       - Physical properties: Molecular solids have relatively low melting and boiling points, are generally soft and brittle, and are poor conductors of electricity.\n\n3. Metallic solids:\n   - Bonding: Metallic solids consist of metal atoms surrounded by a \"sea\" of delocalized electrons, which are free to move throughout the solid. This type of bonding is known as metallic bonding.\n   - Physical properties: Metallic solids have a wide range of melting and boiling points, are generally malleable and ductile, and are good conductors of both heat and electricity. They also exhibit luster, which is the shiny appearance caused by the reflection of light off the delocalized electrons.\n\nBy considering the bonding characteristics and physical properties of an inorganic solid, you can identify whether it is ionic, covalent, or metallic in nature."
