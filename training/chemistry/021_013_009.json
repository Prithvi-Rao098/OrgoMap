    "message_2": "The Lewis structure of carbon dioxide (CO2) consists of a central carbon (C) atom double bonded to two oxygen (O) atoms. The structure can be represented as:\n\nO=C=O\n\nEach oxygen atom has two lone pairs of electrons, while the carbon atom shares four electrons with the oxygen atoms through the double bonds."
