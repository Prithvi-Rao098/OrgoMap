    "message_2": "The reaction between sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is an acid-base reaction, which produces water (H₂O) and sodium sulfate (Na₂SO₄) as products. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nH₂SO₄ + 2NaOH → Na₂SO₄ + 2H₂O\n\nTo calculate the amount of sulfuric acid needed to neutralize 20 grams of sodium hydroxide, we will use stoichiometry. First, we need to find the molar masses of NaOH and H₂SO₄:\n\nNaOH: 22.99 (Na) + 15.999 (O) + 1.007 (H) = 39.996 g/mol\nH₂SO₄: 2(1.007) (H) + 32.06 (S) + 4(15.999) (O) = 98.078 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the moles of NaOH in 20 grams:\n\nmoles of NaOH = (20 g) / (39.996 g/mol) = 0.5001 mol\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of H₂SO₄ reacts with 2 moles of NaOH. Therefore, we need half the moles of H₂SO₄ to neutralize the given amount of NaOH:\n\nmoles of H₂SO₄ = (0.5001 mol) / 2 = 0.25005 mol\n\nFinally, we can find the mass of H₂SO₄ needed:\n\nmass of H₂SO₄ = (0.25005 mol) × (98.078 g/mol) = 24.523 g\n\nSo, approximately 24.523 grams of sulfuric acid are needed to neutralize 20 grams of sodium hydroxide."
