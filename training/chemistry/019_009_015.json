    "message_2": "To calculate the standard free energy change (ΔG°) for the given redox reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG° = Σ ΔG°f(products) - Σ ΔG°f(reactants)\n\nFor the products:\n2 moles of Hg(l) have a ΔG°f of 0 kJ/mol, so the total ΔG°f for Hg(l) is 2 * 0 = 0 kJ.\n1 mole of O2(g) has a ΔG°f of 0 kJ/mol.\n\nFor the reactants:\n2 moles of HgO(s) have a ΔG°f of -90.83 kJ/mol, so the total ΔG°f for HgO(s) is 2 * -90.83 = -181.66 kJ.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔG° = (0 + 0) - (-181.66) = 181.66 kJ\n\nSo, the standard free energy change for the given redox reaction is 181.66 kJ."
