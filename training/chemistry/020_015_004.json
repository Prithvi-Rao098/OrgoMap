Write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction and calculate the pH of the resultant solution if 0.1 mol of NaOH is added to 1 L of 0.1 M acetic acid solution?",
    "message_2": "When a strong base like NaOH is added to a weak acid like acetic acid, the base will react with the acid to form water and the conjugate base of the weak acid (acetate ion). This will result in a decrease in the concentration of the weak acid and an increase in the concentration of its conjugate base. The ionization of the weak acid will be affected due to the change in the concentrations of the acid and its conjugate base.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction between acetic acid (CH₃COOH) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is:\n\nCH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O\n\nNow, let's calculate the pH of the resultant solution.\n\nInitial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH) = 0.1 mol/L * 1 L = 0.1 mol\nMoles of NaOH added = 0.1 mol\n\nSince the reaction between acetic acid and NaOH goes to completion, all the moles of NaOH will react with an equal number of moles of acetic acid.\n\nFinal moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH) = Initial moles - moles reacted with NaOH = 0.1 mol - 0.1 mol = 0 mol\nFinal moles of acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) = Initial moles + moles reacted with NaOH = 0 mol + 0.1 mol = 0.1 mol\n\nSince all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH, the solution now contains only the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) and water. The pH of the solution will be determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction of the acetate ion is:\n\nCH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n\nTo calculate the pH, we need to determine the concentration of OH⁻ ions in the solution. We can use the formula:\n\nKb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n\nWhere Kb is the base ionization constant of the acetate ion. Since acetic acid is a weak acid, we can use the relationship:\n\nKw = Ka * Kb\n\nWhere Kw is the ion product of water (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) and Ka is the acid ionization constant of acetic acid (1.8 x 10⁻⁵).\n\nKb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.8 x 10⁻⁵) = 5.56 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\nLet's assume that x moles of CH₃COO⁻ undergo hydrolysis to form x moles of OH⁻ and CH₃COOH.\n\n5.56 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.1 - x)\n\nSince Kb is very small, we can assume that x is very small compared to 0.1, so:\n\n5.56 x 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.1\n\nx² ≈ 5.56 x 10⁻¹¹\nx ≈ 7.46 x 10⁻⁶\n\nSince x represents the concentration of OH⁻ ions, we can now calculate the pOH and then the pH of the solution.\n\npOH = -log10([OH⁻]) = -log10(7.46 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.13\npH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.13 ≈ 8.87\n\nSo, the pH of the resultant solution after adding 0.1 mol of NaOH to 1 L of 0.1 M acetic acid solution is approximately 8.87."
