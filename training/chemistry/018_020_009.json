    "message_2": "The reaction between hydrochloric acid (HCl) and marble chips (calcium carbonate, CaCO3) can be represented by the following balanced chemical equation:\n\nCaCO3 (s) + 2 HCl (aq) → CaCl2 (aq) + H2O (l) + CO2 (g)\n\nIn this reaction, calcium carbonate reacts with hydrochloric acid to produce calcium chloride, water, and carbon dioxide gas.\n\nEffect of changing the concentration of reactants on the reaction rate:\n\nAccording to the collision theory, the rate of a chemical reaction depends on the frequency of collisions between the reacting particles. When the concentration of reactants is increased, there are more particles present in the same volume, which leads to more frequent collisions between the particles. As a result, the reaction rate increases.\n\nIn the case of the reaction between hydrochloric acid and marble chips, if the concentration of hydrochloric acid is increased, the frequency of collisions between HCl and CaCO3 particles will increase, leading to a faster reaction rate.\n\nEffect of changing the concentration of reactants on the reaction yield:\n\nThe reaction between hydrochloric acid and marble chips is a stoichiometric reaction, meaning that the reactants are consumed in fixed proportions according to the balanced chemical equation. The reaction yield, or the amount of products formed, depends on the limiting reactant – the reactant that is completely consumed first and limits the formation of products.\n\nIf the concentration of hydrochloric acid is increased while keeping the amount of marble chips constant, the reaction will still proceed until all the marble chips are consumed. In this case, the yield of calcium chloride, water, and carbon dioxide will increase, but the percentage yield (the ratio of the actual yield to the theoretical yield) will remain the same.\n\nHowever, if the concentration of both hydrochloric acid and marble chips is increased proportionally, the reaction yield will increase, but the percentage yield will still remain the same, as both reactants are consumed in fixed proportions according to the balanced chemical equation.\n\nIn summary, increasing the concentration of reactants in the reaction between hydrochloric acid and marble chips will increase the reaction rate and the reaction yield, but the percentage yield will remain the same."
