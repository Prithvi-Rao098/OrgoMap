    "message_2": "The inorganic compound formed between magnesium and oxygen is magnesium oxide (MgO). It is an ionic compound, as it is formed by the transfer of electrons between magnesium (a metal) and oxygen (a non-metal). Magnesium loses two electrons to form a Mg2+ ion, while oxygen gains two electrons to form an O2- ion. These ions are attracted to each other due to their opposite charges, resulting in the formation of the ionic compound magnesium oxide."
