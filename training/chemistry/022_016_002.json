    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of methane gas (CH4) under standard conditions, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the combustion reaction:\n\nCH4 (g) + 2 O2 (g) → CO2 (g) + 2 H2O (l)\n\nNext, we need to use the enthalpies of formation for the reactants and products involved in the reaction. The enthalpies of formation for CH4 and CO2 are given as -74.81 kJ/mol and -393.51 kJ/mol, respectively. We also need the enthalpy of formation for H2O (l), which is -285.83 kJ/mol.\n\nNow we can use Hess's Law to calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nΔH = Σ [ΔHf (products)] - Σ [ΔHf (reactants)]\n\nΔH = [1 × (-393.51 kJ/mol) + 2 × (-285.83 kJ/mol)] - [1 × (-74.81 kJ/mol) + 2 × 0 kJ/mol]\n\nΔH = (-393.51 - 571.66 + 74.81) kJ/mol\n\nΔH = -890.36 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change for the combustion of methane gas (CH4) under standard conditions is -890.36 kJ/mol."
