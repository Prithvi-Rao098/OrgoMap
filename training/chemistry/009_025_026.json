    "message_2": "As an AI language model, I cannot perform experiments or analyze experimental data directly. To determine the chemical structure of an unknown compound X using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), you would need to obtain the NMR spectra of the compound and interpret the data.\n\nHere's a general outline of the process:\n\n1. Obtain the NMR spectra: You would need to run both 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR experiments on the compound. This will provide you with information about the hydrogen and carbon atoms present in the molecule.\n\n2. Analyze the 1H-NMR spectrum: Look for the number of signals, their chemical shifts, integration, and splitting patterns. This information will help you identify the types of hydrogen atoms present in the molecule and their relative positions.\n\n3. Analyze the 13C-NMR spectrum: Look for the number of signals and their chemical shifts. This information will help you identify the types of carbon atoms present in the molecule.\n\n4. Combine the information from both spectra: Use the data from the 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra to piece together the structure of the molecule. Look for correlations between the hydrogen and carbon atoms, such as through-bond coupling or through-space interactions.\n\n5. Verify the proposed structure: Once you have a proposed structure, you can use additional techniques, such as 2D-NMR experiments (COSY, HSQC, HMBC, etc.), to confirm or refine the structure.\n\nWithout the actual NMR data, I cannot provide you with the chemical structure of the unknown compound X. If you have the NMR spectra or any other relevant information, please provide it, and I can help you interpret the data and determine the structure."
