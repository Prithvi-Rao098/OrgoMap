    "message_2": "The bond strength between two hydrogen atoms in molecular hydrogen (H2) can be determined using the bond dissociation energy. The bond dissociation energy is the amount of energy required to break a bond between two atoms in a molecule, and it is a measure of the bond strength.\n\nFor molecular hydrogen (H2), the bond dissociation energy is approximately 436 kJ/mol. This value indicates the strength of the bond between the two hydrogen atoms in the H2 molecule."
