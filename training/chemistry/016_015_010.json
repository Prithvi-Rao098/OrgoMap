    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat released when 50 grams of NaOH is dissolved in 500 mL of water at 25°C, we need to first determine the number of moles of NaOH and then use the heat of crystallization to find the total heat released.\n\n1. Calculate the number of moles of NaOH:\nThe molar mass of NaOH is approximately 40 g/mol (23 g/mol for Na, 16 g/mol for O, and 1 g/mol for H).\nNumber of moles = mass / molar mass\nNumber of moles = 50 g / 40 g/mol = 1.25 mol\n\n2. Calculate the heat released from dissolving NaOH:\nHeat released = number of moles × heat of crystallization\nHeat released = 1.25 mol × (-44.51 kJ/mol)\nHeat released = -55.64 kJ\n\nSince the heat released is negative, it indicates that the process is exothermic, meaning heat is released to the surroundings. The total amount of heat released when 50 grams of NaOH is dissolved in 500 mL of water at 25°C is 55.64 kJ."
