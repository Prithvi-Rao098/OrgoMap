    "message_2": "To determine the amount of copper ions in moles, we can use the formula:\n\nmoles = molarity × volume\n\nGiven that the molarity of the copper sulfate solution is 0.1 M and the volume is 500 mL, we can convert the volume to liters:\n\nvolume = 500 mL × (1 L / 1000 mL) = 0.5 L\n\nNow, we can calculate the moles of copper ions:\n\nmoles = 0.1 M × 0.5 L = 0.05 moles\n\nSo, there are 0.05 moles of copper ions present in the 500 mL solution of 0.1 M copper sulfate."
