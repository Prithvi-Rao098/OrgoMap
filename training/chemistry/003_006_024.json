    "message_2": "Infrared (IR) spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy are two complementary techniques used to study molecular vibrations in materials. Both techniques provide information about the vibrational modes of molecules, but they rely on different principles and are sensitive to different types of molecular motions. Here, we will discuss the fundamental differences between these two techniques and provide examples of the types of molecular motions each technique can detect.\n\n1. Principle of interaction with radiation:\nInfrared spectroscopy is based on the absorption of infrared radiation by molecules. When a molecule absorbs infrared radiation, it undergoes a transition from a lower vibrational energy level to a higher one. This absorption occurs when the frequency of the incident radiation matches the frequency of a vibrational mode of the molecule. In order for a vibrational mode to be IR-active, there must be a change in the dipole moment of the molecule during the vibration.\n\nRaman spectroscopy, on the other hand, is based on the inelastic scattering of light by molecules. When a molecule scatters light, it can either gain or lose energy, resulting in a shift in the frequency of the scattered light. This shift in frequency, known as the Raman shift, is proportional to the energy difference between the initial and final vibrational states of the molecule. For a vibrational mode to be Raman-active, there must be a change in the polarizability of the molecule during the vibration.\n\n2. Selection rules and molecular motions detected:\nInfrared spectroscopy is sensitive to vibrations that involve a change in the dipole moment of the molecule. Examples of such vibrations include stretching and bending modes in polar molecules, such as the O-H stretching in alcohols or the C=O stretching in carbonyl compounds. Infrared spectroscopy is less sensitive to vibrations that do not involve a change in the dipole moment, such as symmetric stretching modes in nonpolar molecules.\n\nRaman spectroscopy is sensitive to vibrations that involve a change in the polarizability of the molecule. Examples of such vibrations include symmetric stretching modes in nonpolar molecules, such as the C-C stretching in alkanes, and some bending modes in polar molecules. Raman spectroscopy is less sensitive to vibrations that do not involve a change in the polarizability, such as the O-H stretching in alcohols.\n\n3. Complementary nature of IR and Raman spectroscopy:\nSince IR and Raman spectroscopy are sensitive to different types of molecular vibrations, they can provide complementary information about the vibrational modes of a molecule. For example, a vibrational mode that is not IR-active may be Raman-active, and vice versa. By combining the information obtained from both techniques, a more complete picture of the vibrational modes of a molecule can be obtained.\n\nIn summary, the fundamental difference between infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy lies in the principle of interaction with radiation and the types of molecular motions they can detect. Infrared spectroscopy is based on the absorption of radiation and is sensitive to vibrations that involve a change in the dipole moment, while Raman spectroscopy is based on the inelastic scattering of light and is sensitive to vibrations that involve a change in the polarizability. Both techniques provide complementary information about the vibrational modes of molecules."
