    "message_1": "Calculate the bond dissociation energy of the O-H bond in a water molecule (H2O) given the enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nH2O (g) → H2 (g) + 1/2 O2 (g)\n\nΔH = +483.6 kJ/mol\n\n(Note: the bond dissociation energy represents the energy required to break a bond into its constituent atoms.)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the bond dissociation energy of the O-H bond in a water molecule, we need to consider that there are two O-H bonds in a water molecule. The given enthalpy change (ΔH) represents the energy required to break both O-H bonds and form H2 and 1/2 O2.\n\nΔH = +483.6 kJ/mol (for breaking two O-H bonds)\n\nTo find the bond dissociation energy for one O-H bond, we simply divide the enthalpy change by the number of O-H bonds in a water molecule:\n\nBond dissociation energy (O-H) = ΔH / number of O-H bonds\nBond dissociation energy (O-H) = 483.6 kJ/mol / 2\nBond dissociation energy (O-H) = 241.8 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the bond dissociation energy of the O-H bond in a water molecule is 241.8 kJ/mol."
