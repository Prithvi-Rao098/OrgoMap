    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the dissolution of 10 grams of NaCl, we first need to determine the number of moles of NaCl in 10 grams.\n\nThe molar mass of NaCl is approximately 58.44 g/mol (22.99 g/mol for Na and 35.45 g/mol for Cl).\n\nNumber of moles = mass / molar mass\nNumber of moles = 10 g / 58.44 g/mol ≈ 0.171 mol\n\nNow, we can use the molar enthalpy of dissolution to calculate the standard enthalpy change.\n\nStandard enthalpy change = number of moles × molar enthalpy of dissolution\nStandard enthalpy change = 0.171 mol × (-3.9 kJ/mol) ≈ -0.667 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the dissolution of 10 grams of NaCl in water at 25°C is approximately -0.667 kJ."
