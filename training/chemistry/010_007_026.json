    "message_2": "To find the rate of consumption of silver ions, we need to first determine the number of moles of silver deposited at the cathode and then relate it to the current and time.\n\n1. Calculate the number of moles of silver deposited:\nmoles of silver = mass of silver / molar mass of silver\nmoles of silver = 3.68 g / 107.87 g/mol\nmoles of silver ≈ 0.0341 mol\n\n2. Determine the total charge passed through the electrolyte:\nSince 1 mole of silver ions (Ag+) requires 1 mole of electrons (e-) to be reduced to silver atoms (Ag), the number of moles of electrons is equal to the number of moles of silver.\n\nmoles of electrons = moles of silver ≈ 0.0341 mol\n\nNow, we can find the total charge (Q) using the Faraday constant (F):\nQ = moles of electrons × Faraday constant\nQ = 0.0341 mol × 96500 C/mol\nQ ≈ 3290.5 C\n\n3. Calculate the rate of consumption of silver ions:\nThe current (I) is given as 2.0 A, and the time (t) is 45 minutes, which is equivalent to 2700 seconds (45 × 60 s/min).\n\nThe rate of consumption of silver ions can be determined using the formula:\nrate = total charge / time\nrate = Q / t\nrate = 3290.5 C / 2700 s\nrate ≈ 1.22 C/s\n\nTherefore, the rate of consumption of silver ions in the silver nitrate electrolyte solution is approximately 1.22 C/s."
