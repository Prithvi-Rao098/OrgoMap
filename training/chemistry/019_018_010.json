    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the phase transition reaction of solid iodine to iodine vapor, we need to consider the following steps:\n\n1. Heating solid iodine from its melting point (386.85 K) to its boiling point (457.4 K).\n2. Melting solid iodine to liquid iodine.\n3. Vaporizing liquid iodine to iodine vapor.\n\nStep 1: Heating solid iodine\nΔH1 = Heat capacity of solid iodine × (Boiling point - Melting point)\nΔH1 = 54.44 J/mol*K × (457.4 K - 386.85 K)\nΔH1 = 54.44 J/mol*K × 70.55 K\nΔH1 = 3840.842 J/mol\nΔH1 = 3.840842 kJ/mol\n\nStep 2: Melting solid iodine\nΔH2 = Standard enthalpy of fusion of solid iodine\nΔH2 = 15.52 kJ/mol\n\nStep 3: Vaporizing liquid iodine\nΔH3 = Standard enthalpy of vaporization of iodine\nΔH3 = 41.57 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the total standard enthalpy change for the phase transition reaction:\n\nΔH_total = ΔH1 + ΔH2 + ΔH3\nΔH_total = 3.840842 kJ/mol + 15.52 kJ/mol + 41.57 kJ/mol\nΔH_total = 60.930842 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the phase transition reaction of solid iodine to iodine vapor is approximately 60.93 kJ/mol."
