    "message_1": "What is the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of a powdered sample of activated carbon if its nitrogen adsorption isotherm resulted in a monolayer capacity of 2.62 x 10^-5 mol/g, a multilayer capacity of 4.10 x 10^-5 mol/g, and a relative pressure at monolayer completion of 0.058? The specific surface area of the adsorbent used is 1150 m^2/g.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of the powdered sample of activated carbon, we can use the following formula:\n\nBET surface area = (monolayer capacity × Avogadro's number × molecular cross-sectional area of nitrogen) / mass of the sample\n\nFirst, we need to find the molecular cross-sectional area of nitrogen. The cross-sectional area of nitrogen (N2) is approximately 0.162 nm^2.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nMonolayer capacity = 2.62 x 10^-5 mol/g\nAvogadro's number = 6.022 x 10^23 molecules/mol\nMolecular cross-sectional area of nitrogen = 0.162 nm^2\nSpecific surface area of the adsorbent = 1150 m^2/g\n\nBET surface area = (2.62 x 10^-5 mol/g × 6.022 x 10^23 molecules/mol × 0.162 nm^2) / 1 g\n\nBET surface area = (2.62 x 10^-5 × 6.022 x 10^23 × 0.162) nm^2/g\n\nBET surface area ≈ 2.55 x 10^19 nm^2/g\n\nNow, we need to convert the surface area from nm^2/g to m^2/g:\n\n1 m^2 = 1 x 10^18 nm^2\n\nBET surface area = (2.55 x 10^19 nm^2/g) / (1 x 10^18 nm^2/m^2)\n\nBET surface area ≈ 25.5 m^2/g\n\nSo, the BET surface area of the powdered sample of activated carbon is approximately 25.5 m^2/g."
