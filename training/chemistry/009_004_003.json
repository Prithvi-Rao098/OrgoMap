    "message_2": "Nuclear fusion between hydrogen isotopes, deuterium (²H) and tritium (³H), typically occurs at extremely high temperatures. The minimum temperature required to achieve this fusion is around 40 million Kelvin (40,000,000 K) or 71,999,540.33 degrees Fahrenheit (71,999,540.33 °F). This high temperature is necessary to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged nuclei and to provide enough kinetic energy for the reaction to occur.\n\nThe products of the deuterium-tritium fusion reaction are helium-4 (⁴He), a neutron (n), and a significant amount of energy. The reaction can be represented by the following equation:\n\n²H + ³H → ⁴He + n + energy\n\nThe energy released in this reaction is primarily due to the conversion of a small amount of mass into energy, as described by Einstein's famous equation, E=mc². This energy is what makes nuclear fusion a promising candidate for a future clean and abundant energy source."
