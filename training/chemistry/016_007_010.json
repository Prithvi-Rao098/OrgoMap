    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy of formation of methane gas (CH4), we need to use the standard enthalpies of formation for carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapor (H2O) given, as well as the standard enthalpy of formation for elemental carbon (graphite) and hydrogen gas (H2), which are both 0 kJ/mol by definition.\n\nFirst, we need to find a balanced chemical equation that involves CH4, CO2, and H2O. The combustion of methane is a suitable reaction:\n\nCH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(g)\n\nNow, we can use Hess's Law to find the standard enthalpy of formation of CH4. Hess's Law states that the enthalpy change of a reaction is the same whether it occurs in one step or several steps. We can use the given standard enthalpies of formation to find the enthalpy change for the combustion of methane:\n\nΔH_combustion = ΔH_f(CO2) + 2 * ΔH_f(H2O) - ΔH_f(CH4) - 2 * ΔH_f(O2)\n\nSince the standard enthalpy of formation for O2 is 0 kJ/mol, the equation simplifies to:\n\nΔH_combustion = ΔH_f(CO2) + 2 * ΔH_f(H2O) - ΔH_f(CH4)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values for the standard enthalpies of formation for CO2 and H2O:\n\nΔH_combustion = (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 * (-241.8 kJ/mol) - ΔH_f(CH4)\n\nThe standard enthalpy of combustion for methane (ΔH_combustion) is -890.4 kJ/mol. Now we can solve for the standard enthalpy of formation of CH4:\n\n-890.4 kJ/mol = (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 * (-241.8 kJ/mol) - ΔH_f(CH4)\n\n-890.4 kJ/mol = -877.1 kJ/mol - ΔH_f(CH4)\n\nΔH_f(CH4) = -877.1 kJ/mol + 890.4 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_f(CH4) = 13.3 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy of formation of methane gas (CH4) is 13.3 kJ/mol."
