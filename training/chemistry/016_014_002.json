    "message_2": "To calculate the heat required to sublimate 55 grams of dry ice, we need to use the formula:\n\nq = n * ΔH_sub\n\nwhere q is the heat required, n is the number of moles of the substance, and ΔH_sub is the heat of sublimation.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles (n) of CO2. The molar mass of CO2 is approximately 44.01 g/mol (12.01 g/mol for carbon and 16.00 g/mol for each oxygen atom).\n\nn = mass / molar mass\nn = 55 g / 44.01 g/mol\nn ≈ 1.25 mol\n\nNow we can calculate the heat required (q) using the heat of sublimation (ΔH_sub) given as 25.2 kJ/mol.\n\nq = n * ΔH_sub\nq = 1.25 mol * 25.2 kJ/mol\nq ≈ 31.5 kJ\n\nTherefore, the heat required to sublimate 55 grams of dry ice at -78.5°C and atmospheric pressure is approximately 31.5 kJ."
