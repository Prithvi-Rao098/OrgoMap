    "message_2": "To find the heat capacity of the 25 g sample of iron, we can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat capacity, m is the mass of the sample, c is the specific heat capacity of the substance, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nGiven:\nm = 25 g\nc = 0.45 J/g°C\nInitial temperature (T1) = 25°C\nFinal temperature (T2) = 150°C\n\nFirst, we need to find the change in temperature (ΔT):\nΔT = T2 - T1 = 150°C - 25°C = 125°C\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\nq = (25 g) × (0.45 J/g°C) × (125°C)\n\nq = 25 × 0.45 × 125\nq = 11.25 × 125\nq = 1406.25 J\n\nThe heat capacity of the 25 g sample of iron when heated from 25°C to 150°C is 1406.25 J."
