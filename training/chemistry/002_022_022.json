    "message_2": "To calculate the lattice energy of Calcium oxide (CaO) using the Born-Haber cycle, we need to consider several energy changes that occur during the formation of CaO from its constituent elements. The Born-Haber cycle is a thermochemical cycle that relates the lattice energy to other measurable energies, such as ionization energy, electron affinity, and enthalpy of formation.\n\nHere are the steps involved in the Born-Haber cycle for CaO:\n\n1. Sublimation of solid calcium (Ca) to gaseous calcium (Ca(g)):\n   Ca(s) → Ca(g); ΔH_sublimation = +178 kJ/mol\n\n2. Ionization of gaseous calcium (Ca(g)) to form a calcium ion (Ca²⁺(g)):\n   Ca(g) → Ca²⁺(g) + 2e⁻; ΔH_ionization1 = +590 kJ/mol (first ionization energy)\n   Since calcium has two ionization energies, we need to add both of them:\n   ΔH_ionization2 = +1145 kJ/mol (second ionization energy)\n   Total ionization energy: ΔH_ionization_total = ΔH_ionization1 + ΔH_ionization2 = 590 + 1145 = +1735 kJ/mol\n\n3. Dissociation of oxygen molecule (O₂) into oxygen atoms (O):\n   1/2 O₂(g) → O(g); ΔH_dissociation = +249 kJ/mol\n\n4. Formation of oxide ion (O²⁻) by gaining two electrons by oxygen atom (O):\n   O(g) + 2e⁻ → O²⁻(g); ΔH_electron_affinity = -603 kJ/mol (electron affinity of oxygen)\n\n5. Formation of CaO from gaseous ions:\n   Ca²⁺(g) + O²⁻(g) → CaO(s); ΔH_lattice_energy = ? (lattice energy of CaO)\n\n6. Enthalpy of formation of CaO:\n   Ca(s) + 1/2 O₂(g) → CaO(s); ΔH_formation = -635 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can use the Born-Haber cycle to calculate the lattice energy of CaO:\n\nΔH_lattice_energy = ΔH_formation - ΔH_sublimation - ΔH_ionization_total - ΔH_dissociation - ΔH_electron_affinity\n\nΔH_lattice_energy = -635 kJ/mol - (+178 kJ/mol) - (+1735 kJ/mol) - (+249 kJ/mol) - (-603 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH_lattice_energy = -635 - 178 - 1735 - 249 + 603 = -3194 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the lattice energy of Calcium oxide (CaO) is -3194 kJ/mol.\n\nFactors that affect the lattice energy of CaO:\n\n1. Ionic radii: Smaller ions have a stronger electrostatic attraction between them, leading to higher lattice energy. In the case of CaO, both Ca²⁺ and O²⁻ are relatively small ions, resulting in a high lattice energy.\n\n2. Charge of the ions: The lattice energy is directly proportional to the product of the charges of the ions. In CaO, the charges of the ions are +2 (Ca²⁺) and -2 (O²⁻), which contribute to the high lattice energy.\n\n3. Crystal structure: The arrangement of ions in the crystal lattice also affects the lattice energy. CaO has a rock-salt structure, which is a highly stable arrangement, contributing to its high lattice energy."
