    "message_2": "In the coordination compound [Co(NH3)4Cl2]+, there are two possible geometric isomers: cis and trans.\n\n1. Cis isomer: The two Cl ligands are adjacent to each other on the octahedral complex, with the four NH3 ligands occupying the remaining positions.\n\n2. Trans isomer: The two Cl ligands are opposite each other on the octahedral complex, with the four NH3 ligands occupying the remaining positions.\n\nSo, there are 2 geometric isomers possible for the coordination compound [Co(NH3)4Cl2]+."
