    "message_1": "What is the resistance of an electrochemical cell if the cell potential is 1.5 V and the current passing through the cell is 0.6 A? The electrodes are made up of zinc and copper with their standard reduction potentials being -0.76 V and +0.34 V respectively. The temperature is kept at 25°C and the electrolyte used is 1 M CuSO4 and 1 M ZnSO4.",
    "message_2": "To find the resistance of the electrochemical cell, we can use Ohm's Law, which states that the voltage (V) is equal to the current (I) multiplied by the resistance (R):\n\nV = I × R\n\nWe are given the cell potential (V) as 1.5 V and the current (I) as 0.6 A. We can rearrange the equation to solve for the resistance (R):\n\nR = V / I\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nR = 1.5 V / 0.6 A\n\nR = 2.5 Ω\n\nThe resistance of the electrochemical cell is 2.5 ohms."
