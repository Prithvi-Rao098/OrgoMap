    "message_1": "What functional groups are present in an unknown compound based on the infrared spectrum obtained from infrared spectroscopy analysis?",
    "message_2": "As a chemist, I would need to see the actual infrared (IR) spectrum or have the specific absorption peaks provided to accurately identify the functional groups present in the unknown compound. However, I can provide you with a general guideline on how to interpret an IR spectrum and identify functional groups based on their characteristic absorption peaks:\n\n1. O-H stretch: Broad absorption peak around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of an alcohol (O-H) or carboxylic acid (O-H) functional group.\n\n2. N-H stretch: Sharp absorption peak around 3100-3500 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of an amine (N-H) or amide (N-H) functional group.\n\n3. C-H stretch: Absorption peaks around 2800-3000 cm⁻¹ indicate the presence of alkane (C-H) functional groups, while peaks around 3000-3100 cm⁻¹ indicate the presence of alkene (C-H) or aromatic (C-H) functional groups.\n\n4. C=O stretch: Strong absorption peak around 1650-1750 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a carbonyl group, which can be found in aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, or amides.\n\n5. C=C stretch: Absorption peak around 1600-1680 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of an alkene (C=C) functional group or an aromatic ring.\n\n6. C≡C or C≡N stretch: Absorption peaks around 2100-2260 cm⁻¹ indicate the presence of an alkyne (C≡C) or nitrile (C≡N) functional group.\n\n7. C-O stretch: Absorption peaks around 1000-1300 cm⁻¹ indicate the presence of an ether (C-O), ester (C-O), or carboxylic acid (C-O) functional group.\n\nPlease provide the specific absorption peaks or the actual IR spectrum for a more accurate identification of the functional groups present in the unknown compound."
