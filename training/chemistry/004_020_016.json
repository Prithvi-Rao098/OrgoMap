    "message_2": "An absorption peak at 170-180 nm in UV-Vis spectroscopy is characteristic of compounds with isolated double bonds (C=C) or isolated triple bonds (Câ‰¡C). These functional groups are found in alkenes and alkynes, respectively. The presence of such a peak suggests that the compound contains one of these functional groups."
