    "message_2": "Ibuprofen is an important non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with the molecular formula C13H18O2. The synthesis of ibuprofen from benzene can be achieved through a series of chemical reactions. Here is a retrosynthesis plan for the synthesis of ibuprofen from benzene:\n\n1. Friedel-Crafts Acylation: The first step is to introduce a carbonyl group to the benzene ring. This can be achieved by performing a Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction using propionyl chloride (CH3CH2COCl) and aluminum chloride (AlCl3) as a catalyst. This reaction will yield 1-phenylpropan-1-one.\n\n2. Reduction of Carbonyl Group: Next, reduce the carbonyl group of 1-phenylpropan-1-one to an alcohol using a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride (NaBH4) or lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4). This will yield 1-phenylpropan-1-ol.\n\n3. α-Substitution: Perform an α-substitution reaction on 1-phenylpropan-1-ol using a strong base such as sodium hydride (NaH) to deprotonate the α-hydrogen, followed by the addition of methyl iodide (CH3I) to alkylate the α-carbon. This will yield 2-methyl-1-phenylpropan-1-ol.\n\n4. Swern Oxidation: Convert the primary alcohol group of 2-methyl-1-phenylpropan-1-ol to an aldehyde using Swern oxidation, which involves the use of oxalyl chloride (COCl2) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as reagents. This will yield 2-methyl-1-phenylpropanal.\n\n5. Wittig Reaction: Perform a Wittig reaction on 2-methyl-1-phenylpropanal using (triphenylphosphoranylidene)acetic acid (Ph3P=CHCOOH) and a strong base such as n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) to form a phosphorane intermediate. The reaction will yield (E)-2-methyl-1-phenylprop-1-en-1-yl acetate.\n\n6. Hydrolysis and Decarboxylation: Hydrolyze the ester group of (E)-2-methyl-1-phenylprop-1-en-1-yl acetate using a strong base such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in an aqueous solution. This will yield (E)-2-methyl-1-phenylprop-1-en-1-yl acetic acid. Then, perform a decarboxylation reaction by heating the compound in the presence of a strong acid such as hydrochloric acid (HCl). This will yield (E)-2-methyl-1-phenylprop-1-ene.\n\n7. Hydroboration-Oxidation: Perform a hydroboration-oxidation reaction on (E)-2-methyl-1-phenylprop-1-ene using diborane (B2H6) as the hydroborating agent and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as the oxidizing agent. This will yield (S)-2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanoic acid, which is the desired ibuprofen.\n\nIn summary, the retrosynthesis plan for the synthesis of ibuprofen from benzene involves the following steps:\n\n1. Friedel-Crafts Acylation\n2. Reduction of Carbonyl Group\n3. α-Substitution\n4. Swern Oxidation\n5. Wittig Reaction\n6. Hydrolysis and Decarboxylation\n7. Hydroboration-Oxidation"
