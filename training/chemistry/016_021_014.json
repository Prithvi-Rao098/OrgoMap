    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the polymerization of polyethylene, we need to find the difference in enthalpy between the reactants and products. In this case, the reactants are ethylene (C2H4) and the product is polyethylene ([-CH2-CH2-]n).\n\nThe given enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) values are:\nΔHf° of ethylene (C2H4) = -20.4 kJ/mol\nΔHf° of polyethylene ([-CH2-CH2-]n) = -1024 kJ/mol\n\nSince the reaction equation is:\nnC2H4 (g) → [-CH2-CH2-]n (s)\n\nWe can write the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the reaction as:\nΔH = ΔHf° (products) - ΔHf° (reactants)\n\nHowever, we need to account for the \"n\" moles of ethylene in the reaction. So, the equation becomes:\nΔH = ΔHf° (polyethylene) - n * ΔHf° (ethylene)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\nΔH = (-1024 kJ/mol) - n * (-20.4 kJ/mol)\n\nSince we are looking for the enthalpy change per mole of ethylene, we can divide both sides of the equation by \"n\":\nΔH/n = (-1024 kJ/mol) / n - (-20.4 kJ/mol)\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation:\nΔH/n = -1024 kJ/mol + 20.4 kJ/mol\n\nΔH/n = -1003.6 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the enthalpy change for the polymerization of polyethylene is -1003.6 kJ/mol of ethylene."
