    "message_2": "To calculate the corrosion potential of a copper metal electrode in a 0.1 M CuSO4 solution at 25°C, we can use the Nernst equation. The Nernst equation relates the reduction potential of an electrochemical reaction to the standard reduction potential, temperature, and concentrations of the reactants and products.\n\nThe Nernst equation is given by:\n\nE = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\n\nwhere:\nE = corrosion potential\nE° = standard reduction potential of Cu2+/Cu = +0.34 V\nR = gas constant = 8.314 J/(mol·K)\nT = temperature in Kelvin = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\nn = number of electrons transferred in the redox reaction (for Cu2+/Cu, n = 2)\nF = Faraday's constant = 96485 C/mol\nQ = reaction quotient = [Cu2+]/[Cu]\n\nSince the copper metal electrode is in contact with a 0.1 M CuSO4 solution, the concentration of Cu2+ ions is 0.1 M. The concentration of solid copper is considered to be 1, as it is a pure metal.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the Nernst equation:\n\nE = 0.34 - (8.314 * 298.15 / (2 * 96485)) * ln(0.1/1)\n\nE = 0.34 - (0.043/2) * ln(0.1)\n\nE ≈ 0.34 - (-0.0215) * 2.303\n\nE ≈ 0.34 + 0.0495\n\nE ≈ 0.3895 V\n\nSo, the corrosion potential of the copper metal electrode in a 0.1 M CuSO4 solution at 25°C is approximately 0.3895 V."
