    "message_2": "The standard reduction potential of a copper electrode in a 1 M Cu2+ solution at 25°C can be found in standard reduction potential tables. For the half-reaction:\n\nCu2+ (aq) + 2e- → Cu (s)\n\nThe standard reduction potential (E°) is +0.34 V.\n\nTo determine how the standard reduction potential would change if the copper concentration was changed to 0.1 M Cu2+, we can use the Nernst equation:\n\nE = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\n\nWhere:\nE = the reduction potential at the given conditions\nE° = the standard reduction potential (+0.34 V for Cu2+/Cu)\nR = the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\nT = the temperature in Kelvin (25°C = 298 K)\nn = the number of electrons transferred in the half-reaction (2 for Cu2+/Cu)\nF = Faraday's constant (96,485 C/mol)\nQ = the reaction quotient, which is [Cu2+]/[Cu] (since Cu is a solid, its concentration is considered 1)\n\nFor a 0.1 M Cu2+ solution, Q = [0.1]/[1] = 0.1. Plugging the values into the Nernst equation:\n\nE = 0.34 - (8.314 * 298 / (2 * 96485)) * ln(0.1)\nE ≈ 0.34 + 0.0295 * log10(0.1)\nE ≈ 0.34 + 0.0295 * (-1)\nE ≈ 0.34 - 0.0295\nE ≈ 0.3105 V\n\nSo, the reduction potential of the copper electrode in a 0.1 M Cu2+ solution at 25°C would be approximately 0.3105 V."
