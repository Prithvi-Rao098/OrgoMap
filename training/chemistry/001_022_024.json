    "message_2": "The given compound is CH3CH2CH2-CH(C2H5)(CH3)2. To identify the major product(s) formed in a rearrangement reaction, we need to consider the most stable carbocation intermediate that can be formed. In this case, a hydride shift can occur, leading to the formation of a more stable tertiary carbocation.\n\nThe rearrangement reaction proceeds as follows:\n\n1. A hydride (H-) shift occurs from the CH3CH2CH2 group to the adjacent carbon, forming a tertiary carbocation: CH3CH2C+(CH3)-CH(C2H5)(CH3)2.\n\n2. The carbocation can now lose a proton (H+) to form an alkene, resulting in the major product.\n\nThe major product formed in this rearrangement reaction is:\n\nCH3CH2CH=CH(C2H5)(CH3)2"
