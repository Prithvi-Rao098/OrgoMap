    "message_2": "To calculate the polarization in an electrochemical cell, we need to find the voltage drop across the electrolyte resistance due to the current passing through it. \n\nFirst, we need to convert the effective surface area of the electrode from cm² to m²:\n\n50 cm² * (1 m² / 10,000 cm²) = 0.005 m²\n\nNext, we can calculate the total current (I) passing through the electrolyte using the current density (J) and the effective surface area (A):\n\nI = J * A\nI = 200 A/m² * 0.005 m² = 1 A\n\nNow, we can calculate the voltage drop (V_drop) across the electrolyte resistance (R) using Ohm's law:\n\nV_drop = I * R\nV_drop = 1 A * 10 Ω = 10 V\n\nFinally, we can calculate the polarization (P) by adding the electrode potential (E) and the voltage drop (V_drop):\n\nP = E + V_drop\nP = -0.5 V + 10 V = 9.5 V\n\nThe polarization in the electrochemical cell is 9.5 V."
