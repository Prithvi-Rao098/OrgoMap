    "message_2": "The nuclear binding energy of a helium-4 nucleus can be calculated using the mass defect method. The mass defect is the difference between the mass of the nucleus and the sum of the masses of its individual nucleons. The binding energy can then be found using Einstein's mass-energy equivalence formula, E=mc².\n\nA helium-4 nucleus consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. First, we need to find the total mass of these individual nucleons:\n\nMass of 2 protons = 2 × 1.00728 amu = 2.01456 amu\nMass of 2 neutrons = 2 × 1.00867 amu = 2.01734 amu\nTotal mass of nucleons = 2.01456 amu + 2.01734 amu = 4.03190 amu\n\nThe actual mass of a helium-4 nucleus is 4.001506 amu. Now we can find the mass defect:\n\nMass defect = Total mass of nucleons - Actual mass of helium-4 nucleus\nMass defect = 4.03190 amu - 4.001506 amu = 0.030394 amu\n\nTo calculate the binding energy, we need to convert the mass defect from atomic mass units (amu) to kilograms (kg). The conversion factor is 1 amu = 1.66054 × 10^(-27) kg:\n\nMass defect in kg = 0.030394 amu × 1.66054 × 10^(-27) kg/amu = 5.050 × 10^(-29) kg\n\nNow we can use Einstein's mass-energy equivalence formula, E=mc², where E is the binding energy, m is the mass defect in kg, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum (approximately 3.00 × 10^8 m/s):\n\nBinding energy = (5.050 × 10^(-29) kg) × (3.00 × 10^8 m/s)²\nBinding energy = 5.050 × 10^(-29) kg × 9.00 × 10^16 m²/s²\nBinding energy = 4.545 × 10^(-12) J\n\nTo express the binding energy in more common units for nuclear reactions, we can convert it to MeV (mega-electron volts). The conversion factor is 1 J = 6.242 × 10^(12) MeV:\n\nBinding energy = 4.545 × 10^(-12) J × 6.242 × 10^(12) MeV/J\nBinding energy ≈ 28.4 MeV\n\nSo, the nuclear binding energy of a helium-4 nucleus is approximately 28.4 MeV."
