    "message_2": "To find the empirical formula, we need to determine the simplest whole number ratio of moles of each element in the compound. \n\nFirst, find the smallest number of moles among the elements:\n0.60 moles of calcium\n0.80 moles of phosphorus\n2.40 moles of oxygen\n\nThe smallest number of moles is 0.60 moles of calcium.\n\nNow, divide the moles of each element by the smallest number of moles to get the mole ratio:\nCalcium: 0.60 / 0.60 = 1\nPhosphorus: 0.80 / 0.60 = 1.33\nOxygen: 2.40 / 0.60 = 4\n\nSince the mole ratio for phosphorus is not a whole number, we can multiply all the mole ratios by a small whole number to make them whole numbers. In this case, we can multiply by 3:\n\nCalcium: 1 * 3 = 3\nPhosphorus: 1.33 * 3 = 4 (approximately)\nOxygen: 4 * 3 = 12\n\nSo, the empirical formula of the compound is Ca3P4O12."
