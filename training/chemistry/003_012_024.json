    "message_2": "To calculate the diffusion coefficient of carbon dioxide in air, we can use the Chapman-Enskog equation:\n\nD = (3/16) * (k * T) / (π * μ * M)\n\nwhere:\nD = diffusion coefficient (m²/s)\nk = Boltzmann constant (1.38064852 × 10^-23 J/K)\nT = temperature (K)\nμ = dynamic viscosity of air (Pa·s)\nM = molar mass of carbon dioxide (kg/mol)\nπ = pi (3.14159265)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin:\n\nT(K) = 25 °C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\n\nNext, we need to convert the molar mass of carbon dioxide from grams per mole to kilograms per mole:\n\nM(kg/mol) = 44.01 g/mol * (1 kg / 1000 g) = 0.04401 kg/mol\n\nNow we can plug in the values into the Chapman-Enskog equation:\n\nD = (3/16) * (1.38064852 × 10^-23 J/K * 298.15 K) / (3.14159265 * 1.8 x 10^-5 Pa·s * 0.04401 kg/mol)\n\nD = (3/16) * (4.1129 × 10^-21 J) / (2.772 × 10^-25 kg·m²/s)\n\nD = 1.234 × 10^-20 J / 2.772 × 10^-25 kg·m²/s\n\nD = 4.45 × 10^-6 m²/s\n\nSo, the diffusion coefficient of carbon dioxide in air at a temperature of 25 °C and a pressure of 1 atm is approximately 4.45 × 10^-6 m²/s."
