    "message_2": "In ethanol (C2H5OH), the carbon atom in the CH3 group is bonded to three hydrogen atoms and one carbon atom. The carbon atom in the CH2OH group is bonded to two hydrogen atoms, one carbon atom, and one oxygen atom.\n\nBefore oxidation:\n1. For the CH3 group: Carbon is more electronegative than hydrogen, so it gains 1 electron from each of the three hydrogen atoms, giving it an oxidation state of -3.\n2. For the CH2OH group: Carbon gains 1 electron from each of the two hydrogen atoms, and loses 1 electron to the more electronegative oxygen atom. This gives it an oxidation state of -1.\n\nAfter oxidation, ethanol is converted to acetic acid (CH3COOH).\n\nIn acetic acid, the carbon atom in the CH3 group is bonded to three hydrogen atoms and one carbon atom. The carbon atom in the COOH group is bonded to one oxygen atom in a double bond, one oxygen atom in a single bond, and one carbon atom.\n\n1. For the CH3 group: The oxidation state of carbon remains the same as in ethanol, which is -3.\n2. For the COOH group: Carbon loses 2 electrons to the more electronegative oxygen atom in the double bond and loses 1 electron to the other oxygen atom in the single bond. This gives it an oxidation state of +3.\n\nIn summary, the oxidation states of carbon in ethanol are -3 (CH3) and -1 (CH2OH), and in acetic acid, they are -3 (CH3) and +3 (COOH)."
