    "message_2": "Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is a powerful analytical technique used to identify functional groups in organic compounds by analyzing the vibrations of molecular bonds in response to infrared radiation. When a molecule absorbs IR radiation, it undergoes vibrational transitions, which can be observed as peaks in an IR spectrum. Each functional group has a unique set of vibrational frequencies, allowing chemists to identify them based on their characteristic peaks.\n\nTo identify the functional groups present in a given compound using IR spectroscopy, you should follow these steps:\n\n1. Obtain the IR spectrum of the compound.\n2. Examine the spectrum for characteristic peaks associated with specific functional groups.\n3. Compare the observed peaks with known reference values for functional groups.\n\nHere are some common functional groups and their characteristic peaks in the IR spectrum:\n\n1. Alcohols (O-H): A broad peak around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of an O-H bond, which is characteristic of alcohols.\n\n2. Carboxylic Acids (O-H): Carboxylic acids also have an O-H bond, but their broad peak is typically centered around 2500-3300 cm⁻¹, often with a \"C=O\" peak around 1700 cm⁻¹.\n\n3. Amines (N-H): Amines show a peak for N-H stretching around 3300-3500 cm⁻¹. Primary amines have two peaks, while secondary amines have one peak in this region.\n\n4. Alkanes (C-H): Alkanes exhibit peaks for C-H stretching around 2850-3000 cm⁻¹. These peaks are usually sharp and well-defined.\n\n5. Alkenes (C=C and C-H): Alkenes show a peak for C=C stretching around 1600-1680 cm⁻¹ and a peak for C-H stretching around 3000-3100 cm⁻¹.\n\n6. Alkynes (C≡C and C-H): Alkynes exhibit a peak for C≡C stretching around 2100-2260 cm⁻¹ and a peak for C-H stretching around 3300 cm⁻¹.\n\n7. Carbonyl Compounds (C=O): Carbonyl compounds show a strong, sharp peak for C=O stretching around 1650-1750 cm⁻¹. The exact position depends on the type of carbonyl compound (e.g., ketones, aldehydes, esters, or amides).\n\n8. Nitriles (C≡N): Nitriles have a peak for C≡N stretching around 2210-2260 cm⁻¹.\n\nBy analyzing the IR spectrum of a given compound and comparing the observed peaks with the characteristic peaks of known functional groups, you can identify the functional groups present in the compound."
