    "message_1": "A chemistry student needs to calculate the heat of sublimation for iodine given that its enthalpy of fusion is 15.52 kJ/mol and its enthalpy of vaporization is 41.57 kJ/mol. The molar mass of iodine is 126.90 g/mol. What is the heat of sublimation for iodine in kJ/mol?",
    "message_2": "The heat of sublimation is the energy required to convert a substance from its solid phase directly to its gas phase without passing through the liquid phase. In the case of iodine, we are given the enthalpy of fusion (energy required to convert solid to liquid) and the enthalpy of vaporization (energy required to convert liquid to gas). To find the heat of sublimation, we simply add these two values together:\n\nHeat of sublimation = Enthalpy of fusion + Enthalpy of vaporization\nHeat of sublimation = 15.52 kJ/mol + 41.57 kJ/mol\nHeat of sublimation = 57.09 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the heat of sublimation for iodine is 57.09 kJ/mol."
