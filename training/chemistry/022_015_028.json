The balanced equation for the reaction is: 2A + 3B -> 4C.",
    "message_2": "To solve this percent yield problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the theoretical yield of product C based on the given amount of reactant A.\n2. Calculate the percent yield using the actual yield (175 grams of product C) and the theoretical yield.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the theoretical yield\nThe balanced equation is: 2A + 3B -> 4C\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 2 moles of A produce 4 moles of C. \n\nFirst, we need to find the molar mass of A and C. Unfortunately, the problem does not provide the molecular formula for A and C. However, we can still express the theoretical yield in terms of the molar mass ratio.\n\nLet M_A be the molar mass of A and M_C be the molar mass of C. Then, the theoretical yield of C can be calculated as follows:\n\nTheoretical yield of C = (200 g A) * (4 moles C / 2 moles A) * (M_C / M_A)\n\nStep 2: Calculate the percent yield\nPercent yield = (Actual yield / Theoretical yield) * 100\n\nActual yield = 175 g of product C\n\nPercent yield = (175 g / (200 g * (4/2) * (M_C / M_A))) * 100\n\nPercent yield = (175 / (100 * (M_C / M_A))) * 100\n\nPercent yield = 175 / (M_C / M_A)\n\nWithout the molar masses of A and C, we cannot provide a numerical value for the percent yield. However, the formula above can be used to calculate the percent yield once the molar masses are known."
