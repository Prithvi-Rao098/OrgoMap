    "message_2": "To determine the number of electrons transferred during the electrolysis, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total charge passed through the solution.\n2. Determine the number of moles of electrons transferred.\n3. Calculate the number of electrons transferred.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total charge passed through the solution\nCharge (Q) = Current (I) × Time (t)\nGiven, Current (I) = 1.5 amps and Time (t) = 45 minutes = 45 × 60 seconds (since 1 minute = 60 seconds)\n\nQ = 1.5 A × (45 × 60) s = 1.5 A × 2700 s = 4050 Coulombs\n\nStep 2: Determine the number of moles of electrons transferred\n1 mole of electrons has a charge of 1 Faraday (F) which is equal to 96485 Coulombs.\n\nMoles of electrons transferred = Total charge passed / Charge of 1 mole of electrons\nMoles of electrons transferred = 4050 C / 96485 C/mol = 0.0419 moles\n\nStep 3: Calculate the number of electrons transferred\nNumber of electrons transferred = Moles of electrons transferred × Avogadro's number (6.022 × 10^23 electrons/mol)\n\nNumber of electrons transferred = 0.0419 moles × 6.022 × 10^23 electrons/mol = 2.52 × 10^22 electrons\n\nSo, the number of electrons transferred during the electrolysis of the 2.5 mol/L lead(II) nitrate solution using a current of 1.5 amps for 45 minutes is approximately 2.52 × 10^22 electrons."
