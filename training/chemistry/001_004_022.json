    "message_2": "The nucleophilic substitution reaction of an alkyl halide with a primary amine follows an SN2 (Substitution Nucleophilic Bimolecular) mechanism. In this mechanism, the nucleophile (amine) attacks the electrophilic carbon atom of the alkyl halide, leading to the formation of a new bond and the simultaneous displacement of the halide ion as a leaving group. The reaction proceeds in a single concerted step, with a transition state in which the nucleophile and the leaving group are both partially bonded to the electrophilic carbon.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of the reaction between an alkyl halide (R-X) and a primary amine (NH2R'):\n\n1. The lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom of the primary amine acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbon atom of the alkyl halide. The carbon atom is electrophilic due to the polarized C-X bond, where X is a halogen atom (Cl, Br, or I).\n\nR-X + NH2R' → [R-NH2R'...X]‡\n\n2. In the transition state [R-NH2R'...X]‡, the nucleophile (amine) is partially bonded to the electrophilic carbon, while the bond between the carbon and the halogen atom is partially broken.\n\n3. The bond between the electrophilic carbon and the halogen atom is completely broken, and the halogen atom leaves as a halide ion (X-). The nucleophile (amine) forms a new bond with the electrophilic carbon, resulting in the formation of a secondary amine.\n\n[R-NH2R'...X]‡ → R-NH-R' + X-\n\nOverall, the balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nR-X + NH2R' → R-NH-R' + X-\n\nHere, R and R' represent alkyl groups, and X represents a halogen atom (Cl, Br, or I).\n\nIt is important to note that if the reaction is carried out in the presence of excess primary amine, further substitution reactions can occur, leading to the formation of tertiary amines and quaternary ammonium salts."
