    "message_1": "Sure, here's a problem for you:\n\nConsider the following reaction: \n\nN2 (g) + 3 H2 (g) ⇌ 2 NH3 (g)\n\nIf the equilibrium concentrations of N2, H2 and NH3 are 0.25 M, 0.75 M and 0.50 M, respectively, calculate the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction, we can use the expression:\n\nKc = [NH3]^2 / ([N2] * [H2]^3)\n\nwhere the concentrations are given in molarity (M).\n\nGiven the equilibrium concentrations of N2, H2, and NH3 are 0.25 M, 0.75 M, and 0.50 M, respectively, we can plug these values into the expression:\n\nKc = (0.50)^2 / (0.25 * (0.75)^3)\n\nKc = 0.25 / (0.25 * 0.421875)\n\nKc = 0.25 / 0.10546875\n\nKc ≈ 2.37\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction is approximately 2.37."
