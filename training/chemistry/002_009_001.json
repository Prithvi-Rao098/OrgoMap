    "message_1": "A compound contains 42.8% carbon, 14.3% hydrogen, and 42.9% oxygen by mass. Determine its empirical formula.",
    "message_2": "To determine the empirical formula, we need to find the mole ratio of the elements in the compound. We will do this by converting the mass percentages to moles and then finding the simplest whole number ratio.\n\n1. Convert mass percentages to grams (assuming 100g of the compound):\nCarbon (C): 42.8g\nHydrogen (H): 14.3g\nOxygen (O): 42.9g\n\n2. Convert grams to moles using the molar mass of each element:\nCarbon: 42.8g / 12.01g/mol (molar mass of C) = 3.57 mol\nHydrogen: 14.3g / 1.01g/mol (molar mass of H) = 14.16 mol\nOxygen: 42.9g / 16.00g/mol (molar mass of O) = 2.68 mol\n\n3. Divide each mole value by the smallest mole value to find the mole ratio:\nCarbon: 3.57 mol / 2.68 mol = 1.33\nHydrogen: 14.16 mol / 2.68 mol = 5.28\nOxygen: 2.68 mol / 2.68 mol = 1\n\n4. Round the mole ratios to the nearest whole number:\nCarbon: 1.33 ≈ 1\nHydrogen: 5.28 ≈ 5\nOxygen: 1\n\n5. Write the empirical formula using the whole number mole ratios:\nC₁H₅O₁ or CH₅O\n\nThe empirical formula of the compound is CH₅O."
