    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the given reaction, we can use Hess's Law, which states that the total enthalpy change for a reaction is the sum of the enthalpy changes for each step in the reaction.\n\nWe are given two reactions:\n\n1) 2H2 (g) + O2 (g) → 2H2O (g) ΔH1 = -483.6 kJ/mol\n2) 2H2O (g) → 2H2O (l) ΔH2 = -40.7 kJ/mol\n\nThe overall reaction we want to find the enthalpy change for is:\n\n2H2 (g) + O2 (g) → 2H2O (l)\n\nTo find the enthalpy change for this reaction, we can add the enthalpy changes for the two given reactions:\n\nΔH_total = ΔH1 + ΔH2\nΔH_total = (-483.6 kJ/mol) + (-40.7 kJ/mol)\nΔH_total = -524.3 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the enthalpy change for the reaction 2H2 (g) + O2 (g) → 2H2O (l) is -524.3 kJ/mol."
