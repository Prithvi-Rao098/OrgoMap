    "message_2": "To calculate the bond energy required to break all the C-H bonds in a mole of methane (CH4) gas, we first need to know the bond energy of a single C-H bond. The bond energy of a C-H bond is approximately 414 kJ/mol.\n\nMethane (CH4) has four C-H bonds. To break all the C-H bonds in one molecule of methane, we need to multiply the bond energy of a single C-H bond by the number of bonds:\n\nEnergy required to break all C-H bonds in one molecule of methane = 414 kJ/mol × 4 = 1656 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we need to calculate the energy required to break all the C-H bonds in one mole of methane. Since there are 6.022 x 10^23 molecules in one mole (Avogadro's number), we can multiply the energy required to break all C-H bonds in one molecule by Avogadro's number:\n\nEnergy required to break all C-H bonds in one mole of methane = 1656 kJ/mol × 6.022 x 10^23 molecules/mol = 9.97 x 10^26 kJ\n\nTherefore, the bond energy required to break all the C-H bonds in a mole of methane (CH4) gas is approximately 9.97 x 10^26 kJ."
