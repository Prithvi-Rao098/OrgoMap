    "message_1": "What is the molecular formula of the unknown compound X, which has a molecular ion peak at m/z 192 and fragments at m/z 174 and 120 in its mass spectrum?",
    "message_2": "To determine the molecular formula of the unknown compound X, we need to analyze the mass spectrum data provided.\n\n1. Molecular ion peak (M+): The molecular ion peak is at m/z 192, which corresponds to the molecular weight of the compound. This means that the molecular formula of compound X should have a total mass of 192 atomic mass units (amu).\n\n2. Fragment peaks: The fragment peaks at m/z 174 and 120 can provide information about the structure of the compound. The difference between the molecular ion peak and the fragment peaks can give us clues about the functional groups or atoms that are lost during fragmentation.\n\n- The difference between the molecular ion peak (192) and the first fragment peak (174) is 18 amu. This difference corresponds to the mass of a water molecule (H2O), which suggests that compound X may have a hydroxyl group (OH) or another functional group that can lose a water molecule during fragmentation.\n\n- The difference between the molecular ion peak (192) and the second fragment peak (120) is 72 amu. This difference could correspond to the loss of a larger functional group or a combination of smaller groups/atoms.\n\nTo determine the molecular formula of compound X, we can use the molecular weight (192 amu) and consider the possible elements and functional groups that could be present in the compound. Common elements found in organic compounds include carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and nitrogen (N).\n\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n\n- If the compound contains only carbon and hydrogen (a hydrocarbon), the molecular formula would be C12H24 (192 amu). However, this does not account for the loss of a water molecule (18 amu) during fragmentation.\n\n- If the compound contains carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, we can consider the presence of a hydroxyl group (OH) or a carbonyl group (C=O). For example, the molecular formula could be C10H22O (192 amu), which accounts for the loss of a water molecule during fragmentation.\n\n- If the compound contains carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen, we can consider the presence of an amine group (NH2) or a nitrile group (Câ‰¡N). For example, the molecular formula could be C11H20N2 (192 amu), but this does not account for the loss of a water molecule during fragmentation.\n\nBased on the information provided, it is most likely that the molecular formula of the unknown compound X is C10H22O, which has a molecular weight of 192 amu and can lose a water molecule during fragmentation. However, further analysis, such as infrared (IR) spectroscopy or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, would be needed to confirm the presence of specific functional groups and the exact structure of the compound."
