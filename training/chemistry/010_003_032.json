Given that E°cell for the reaction is 1.66 V and the standard potential for the reduction of Al3+ ions to Al is -1.66 V.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) for the electrochemical reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG° = -nFE°cell\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the reaction, F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol), and E°cell is the standard cell potential.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the balanced half-reactions for the oxidation of aluminum and the reduction of oxygen:\n\nOxidation half-reaction: 4Al(s) → 4Al³⁺(aq) + 12e⁻\nReduction half-reaction: 3O²⁻(aq) + 12e⁻ → 6O²⁻(aq)\n\nNow, we can combine these half-reactions to form the overall balanced reaction:\n\n4Al(s) + 3O²⁻(aq) → 2Al₂O₃(s)\n\nFrom the balanced reaction, we can see that 12 moles of electrons are transferred (n = 12).\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the equation:\n\nΔG° = -nFE°cell\nΔG° = -(12 mol)(96,485 C/mol)(1.66 V)\n\nΔG° = -1,919,468.52 J/mol\n\nSince the standard Gibbs free energy change is usually expressed in kJ/mol, we can convert the value:\n\nΔG° = -1,919.47 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard Gibbs free energy change for the electrochemical reaction of 2 moles of aluminum being oxidized to form 3 moles of aluminum oxide in a standard state is -1,919.47 kJ/mol."
