    "message_1": "Calculate the concentration of Cl^- ions in a solution if the electrode potential of a Pt/AgCl electrode in the solution is measured to be +0.222 V versus the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) at 25°C. The standard electrode potential for the reaction AgCl(s) + e^- → Ag(s) + Cl^- is +0.222 V versus SHE at 25°C. Assume the activity coefficient of Cl^- ions in the solution is equal to 1.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the concentration of Cl⁻ ions in the solution, we can use the Nernst equation. The Nernst equation relates the electrode potential of a half-cell to the standard electrode potential, temperature, and concentrations (or activities) of the species involved in the redox reaction. The Nernst equation is given by:\n\nE = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\n\nwhere:\nE = electrode potential of the half-cell\nE° = standard electrode potential\nR = gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\nT = temperature in Kelvin (25°C = 298.15 K)\nn = number of electrons transferred in the redox reaction (1 for AgCl/Ag redox couple)\nF = Faraday's constant (96,485 C/mol)\nQ = reaction quotient, which is equal to the concentration of Cl⁻ ions in this case\n\nGiven that the electrode potential (E) and the standard electrode potential (E°) are both +0.222 V, the equation becomes:\n\n0.222 = 0.222 - (8.314 * 298.15 / (1 * 96,485)) * ln([Cl⁻])\n\nSolving for [Cl⁻]:\n\n0 = - (8.314 * 298.15 / 96,485) * ln([Cl⁻])\n\nSince the natural logarithm (ln) of 1 is 0, this equation implies that:\n\n[Cl⁻] = 1\n\nTherefore, the concentration of Cl⁻ ions in the solution is 1 M (1 mol/L)."
