    "message_2": "Colorimetry is a technique used to determine the concentration of a colored substance in a solution by measuring the amount of light it absorbs. In this case, we will use colorimetry to determine the concentration of copper ions in the sample. Here's a step-by-step procedure:\n\n1. Prepare a series of standard solutions: To create a calibration curve, you'll need to prepare a series of standard solutions with known concentrations of copper ions. You can do this by dissolving a known amount of copper salt (e.g., copper sulfate) in a fixed volume of water. Prepare at least five different concentrations, including a blank solution with no copper ions.\n\n2. Complexation reaction: Copper ions in solution can form colored complexes with certain ligands. In this case, we can use a reagent like ammonia or a biuret reagent to form a colored complex with the copper ions. Add an equal volume of the chosen reagent to each standard solution and the unknown sample. Allow the reaction to proceed for a few minutes, so the colored complex forms completely.\n\n3. Measure absorbance: Using a colorimeter or a spectrophotometer, measure the absorbance of each standard solution and the unknown sample at the wavelength of maximum absorbance for the copper complex (usually around 600-700 nm). Make sure to zero the instrument with the blank solution before taking measurements.\n\n4. Create a calibration curve: Plot the absorbance values of the standard solutions against their respective copper ion concentrations. The resulting graph should be a straight line, as described by the Beer-Lambert Law, which states that the absorbance of a solution is directly proportional to its concentration. Perform a linear regression to obtain the equation of the line (y = mx + b), where y is the absorbance, x is the concentration, m is the slope, and b is the y-intercept.\n\n5. Determine the concentration of the unknown sample: Using the absorbance value of the unknown sample, substitute it into the equation obtained from the calibration curve to solve for the concentration (x). This will give you the concentration of copper ions in the unknown sample.\n\nIn summary, colorimetry relies on the principle that the absorbance of a colored solution is directly proportional to its concentration. By creating a calibration curve using standard solutions and measuring the absorbance of an unknown sample, you can determine the concentration of copper ions in the sample."
