    "message_2": "To find the concentration of iron (II) ions in the solution, we can use the Beer-Lambert Law, which states:\n\nA = ε * c * l\n\nwhere A is the absorbance, ε is the molar absorptivity (L mol^-1 cm^-1), c is the concentration (mol L^-1), and l is the path length (cm).\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nA = 0.58\nε = 9.6 x 10^3 L mol^-1 cm^-1\n\nAssuming the path length (l) is the standard 1 cm, we can rearrange the equation to solve for the concentration (c):\n\nc = A / (ε * l)\n\nc = 0.58 / (9.6 x 10^3 L mol^-1 cm^-1 * 1 cm)\n\nc = 0.58 / (9.6 x 10^3)\n\nc ≈ 6.04 x 10^-5 mol L^-1\n\nSo, the concentration of iron (II) ions in the solution is approximately 6.04 x 10^-5 mol L^-1."
