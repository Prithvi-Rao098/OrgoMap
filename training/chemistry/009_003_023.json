    "message_2": "To calculate the energy released in the nuclear fission of one uranium-235 atom, we need to find the difference in binding energy between the initial uranium-235 nucleus and the final products, krypton-92 and barium-141. We can use the mass-energy equivalence formula, E=mc^2, to convert the mass difference into energy.\n\nFirst, we need to find the atomic masses of the isotopes involved:\n\n- Uranium-235: 235.043930 u\n- Krypton-92: 91.926156 u\n- Barium-141: 140.914411 u\n\nNext, we calculate the mass difference between the initial and final products:\n\nMass difference = (mass of uranium-235) - (mass of krypton-92 + mass of barium-141)\nMass difference = 235.043930 u - (91.926156 u + 140.914411 u)\nMass difference = 235.043930 u - 232.840567 u\nMass difference = 2.203363 u\n\nNow, we convert the mass difference into energy using the mass-energy equivalence formula, E=mc^2, where m is the mass difference, and c is the speed of light (2.99792458 x 10^8 m/s). We also need to convert atomic mass units (u) to kilograms (1 u = 1.66053906660 x 10^-27 kg):\n\nMass difference = 2.203363 u * 1.66053906660 x 10^-27 kg/u\nMass difference = 3.658301 x 10^-27 kg\n\nEnergy released = (3.658301 x 10^-27 kg) * (2.99792458 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nEnergy released = 3.273 x 10^-11 Joules\n\nTherefore, the energy released in the nuclear fission of one uranium-235 atom, assuming that the products are krypton-92 and barium-141, is approximately 3.273 x 10^-11 Joules."
