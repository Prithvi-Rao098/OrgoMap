    "message_2": "To calculate the standard electrode potential for the redox reaction, we need to determine the standard oxidation potential for Ag(s) → Ag+(aq) + e- and then combine it with the standard reduction potential for Cu2+(aq) + 2e- → Cu(s).\n\nFirst, we find the standard oxidation potential for Ag(s) → Ag+(aq) + e-. Since we know the standard reduction potential for the reverse reaction (Ag+(aq) + e- → Ag(s)) is 0.80 V, we can find the standard oxidation potential by changing the sign:\n\nStandard oxidation potential for Ag(s) → Ag+(aq) + e- = -0.80 V\n\nNow, we can combine the standard oxidation potential for Ag(s) → Ag+(aq) + e- with the standard reduction potential for Cu2+(aq) + 2e- → Cu(s):\n\nStandard electrode potential = Standard oxidation potential (Ag) + Standard reduction potential (Cu)\n\nStandard electrode potential = (-0.80 V) + (0.34 V)\n\nStandard electrode potential = -0.46 V\n\nThe standard electrode potential for the redox reaction where Ag(s) is oxidized by Cu2+(aq) to form Ag+(aq) and Cu(s) is -0.46 V."
