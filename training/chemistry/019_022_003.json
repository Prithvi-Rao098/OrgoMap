    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the combustion of 2-methylpropan-2-ol:\n\nC4H10O + 6O2 → 4CO2 + 5H2O\n\nNext, we need to find the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) for each compound involved in the reaction. The values are as follows:\n\nΔHf° (C4H10O) = -267.3 kJ/mol\nΔHf° (O2) = 0 kJ/mol (since it is an element in its standard state)\nΔHf° (CO2) = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔHf° (H2O) = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can use Hess's Law to calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nΔH° = Σ [ΔHf° (products)] - Σ [ΔHf° (reactants)]\n\nΔH° = [4(-393.5) + 5(-285.8)] - [(-267.3) + 6(0)]\n\nΔH° = (-1574 + -1429) - (-267.3)\n\nΔH° = -3003 + 267.3\n\nΔH° = -2735.7 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the reaction of 2-methylpropan-2-ol with oxygen gas to form carbon dioxide and water at standard conditions is -2735.7 kJ/mol."
