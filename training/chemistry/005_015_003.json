    "message_2": "The net yield of ATP per one cycle of the Citric Acid Cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle) and Oxidative Phosphorylation depends on the efficiency of the electron transport chain and the number of protons pumped across the inner mitochondrial membrane.\n\nFor one cycle of the Citric Acid Cycle, the following high-energy molecules are produced:\n\n- 3 NADH\n- 1 FADH2\n- 1 GTP (which can be converted to ATP)\n\nDuring Oxidative Phosphorylation, NADH and FADH2 are oxidized in the electron transport chain, and the energy released is used to pump protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane, generating a proton gradient. This gradient drives the synthesis of ATP via ATP synthase.\n\nThe P/O ratio (the number of ATP molecules produced per oxygen atom reduced) varies for NADH and FADH2:\n\n- For NADH, the P/O ratio is approximately 2.5 ATP per NADH.\n- For FADH2, the P/O ratio is approximately 1.5 ATP per FADH2.\n\nSo, for one cycle of the Citric Acid Cycle and Oxidative Phosphorylation, the net yield of ATP is:\n\n(3 NADH × 2.5 ATP/NADH) + (1 FADH2 × 1.5 ATP/FADH2) + 1 GTP\n\n= 7.5 ATP + 1.5 ATP + 1 GTP\n\n= 9 ATP + 1 GTP (which can be converted to ATP)\n\n= 10 ATP\n\nHowever, it's important to note that these values are approximate, and the actual ATP yield may vary depending on the efficiency of the electron transport chain and other factors in the cell."
