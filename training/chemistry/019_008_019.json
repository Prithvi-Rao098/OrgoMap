    "message_1": "What is the standard electrode potential of the following redox reaction: \n\nCu2+(aq) + Ni(s) → Cu(s) + Ni2+(aq) \n\ngiven the half-reactions: \n\nCu2+(aq) + 2 e- → Cu(s)    E° = +0.34 V \n\nNi2+(aq) + 2 e- → Ni(s)    E° = -0.24 V \n\nAssume standard conditions and include the sign of the potential.",
    "message_2": "To find the standard electrode potential of the redox reaction, we need to subtract the reduction potential of the half-reaction being reversed (oxidation) from the reduction potential of the half-reaction that remains as reduction.\n\nIn this case, the Ni(s) is being oxidized to Ni2+(aq), so we need to reverse the second half-reaction:\n\nNi(s) → Ni2+(aq) + 2 e-    E° = +0.24 V (reversed sign)\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard electrode potential of the overall redox reaction:\n\nE°(cell) = E°(reduction) - E°(oxidation)\nE°(cell) = (+0.34 V) - (+0.24 V)\nE°(cell) = +0.10 V\n\nSo, the standard electrode potential of the given redox reaction is +0.10 V."
