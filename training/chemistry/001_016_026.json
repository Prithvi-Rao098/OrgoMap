    "message_2": "The nucleophilic substitution reaction between 1-bromopropane and sodium hydroxide in ethanol solvent follows an SN2 mechanism. Here is a detailed step-by-step mechanism with the corresponding intermediates and an explanation of the stereochemistry of the reaction:\n\n1. Formation of the nucleophile: Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) dissociates into sodium (Na+) and hydroxide (OH-) ions in the ethanol solvent. The hydroxide ion acts as a strong nucleophile due to its negative charge.\n\n2. Nucleophilic attack: The hydroxide ion (OH-) attacks the electrophilic carbon atom (C1) of 1-bromopropane from the backside, opposite to the bromine atom. This backside attack is due to the partial positive charge on the carbon atom, which is caused by the polar bond between carbon and bromine. The nucleophile approaches the electrophilic carbon from the backside to minimize steric hindrance and maximize overlap between the nucleophile's lone pair and the carbon-bromine antibonding orbital.\n\n3. Transition state: A pentacoordinate transition state is formed, where the hydroxide ion is partially bonded to the electrophilic carbon, and the carbon-bromine bond is partially broken. In this transition state, the stereochemistry at the electrophilic carbon is inverted, forming a configuration that is the mirror image of the starting material.\n\n4. Leaving group departure: The bromine atom leaves as a bromide ion (Br-), and the carbon-oxygen bond is fully formed, resulting in the formation of 1-propanol.\n\n5. Product formation: The final product, 1-propanol, is formed with an inversion of stereochemistry at the electrophilic carbon atom compared to the starting material, 1-bromopropane.\n\nIn summary, the nucleophilic substitution reaction between 1-bromopropane and sodium hydroxide in ethanol solvent follows an SN2 mechanism, which involves a single concerted step with a backside attack by the nucleophile, leading to an inversion of stereochemistry at the electrophilic carbon atom. The final product is 1-propanol."
