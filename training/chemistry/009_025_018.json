    "message_2": "To determine the chemical structure of a compound with a molecular formula of C6H12O6 using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), we would need the actual MRS data, including chemical shifts, coupling constants, and multiplicities of the peaks. However, I can provide you with a common compound that has the molecular formula C6H12O6, which is glucose.\n\nThe chemical structure of glucose is as follows:\n\n       HOCH2-(CHOH)4-CHO\n\nIn its cyclic form, glucose is commonly represented as a six-membered ring with oxygen as one of the members. The hydroxyl groups (-OH) are attached to the carbon atoms in the ring, and there is a CH2OH group attached to the last carbon atom in the ring. The exact configuration of the hydroxyl groups in the ring determines whether it is alpha or beta glucose.\n\nPlease provide the MRS data if you would like a more specific answer based on the spectroscopic information."
