    "message_2": "To calculate the electrical conductivity of the solution, we need to consider the contributions of each ion in the solution. The electrical conductivity (κ) can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nκ = Σ(ci * λi)\n\nwhere ci is the concentration of each ion (in mol/L) and λi is the molar conductivity of each ion (in S cm²/mol).\n\nFirst, let's identify the ions and their concentrations in the solution:\n\n1. Sodium ion (Na+): 0.1 M (from sodium chloride)\n2. Chloride ion (Cl-): 0.1 M (from sodium chloride)\n3. Potassium ion (K+): 0.2 M (from potassium nitrate)\n4. Nitrate ion (NO3-): 0.2 M (from potassium nitrate)\n\nNext, we need the molar conductivity values (λ) for each ion at 25 °C. These values can be found in tables or literature. Here are the approximate values for each ion:\n\n1. λ(Na+) = 50.1 S cm²/mol\n2. λ(Cl-) = 76.3 S cm²/mol\n3. λ(K+) = 73.5 S cm²/mol\n4. λ(NO3-) = 71.4 S cm²/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the electrical conductivity (κ) using the equation mentioned above:\n\nκ = (0.1 M * 50.1 S cm²/mol) + (0.1 M * 76.3 S cm²/mol) + (0.2 M * 73.5 S cm²/mol) + (0.2 M * 71.4 S cm²/mol)\nκ = (5.01 S cm²) + (7.63 S cm²) + (14.7 S cm²) + (14.28 S cm²)\nκ = 41.62 S cm²\n\nSince the cell constant is given as 1.0 cm-1, we can directly use the calculated κ value as the electrical conductivity of the solution:\n\nElectrical conductivity of the solution = 41.62 S/m"
