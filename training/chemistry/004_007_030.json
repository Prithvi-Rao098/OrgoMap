    "message_1": "How much sodium chloride (NaCl) can be obtained from a sample of 5 grams of sea salt, given that the percentage of NaCl in the sample is 85% and gravimetric analysis is being used for the quantification?",
    "message_2": "To determine the amount of sodium chloride (NaCl) that can be obtained from the 5 grams of sea salt, you can use the given percentage of NaCl in the sample.\n\nSince the percentage of NaCl in the sea salt sample is 85%, you can calculate the amount of NaCl by multiplying the total weight of the sample (5 grams) by the percentage of NaCl (85%).\n\nAmount of NaCl = (5 grams) x (85%) = (5 grams) x (0.85) = 4.25 grams\n\nSo, 4.25 grams of sodium chloride (NaCl) can be obtained from the 5 grams of sea salt sample using gravimetric analysis."
