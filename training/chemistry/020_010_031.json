Calculate the new equilibrium constant if the initial solution contained 0.1 M AgCl and 0.1 M NaCl and after adding 0.01 moles of NaCl, a portion of the AgCl precipitated out of solution.",
    "message_2": "When NaCl is added to a solution containing AgCl that is already at equilibrium, the common ion effect comes into play. The common ion effect states that when a salt containing an ion that is already present in the solution is added, the solubility of the original salt decreases. In this case, the common ion is Cl-.\n\nThe equilibrium reaction for AgCl is:\n\nAgCl (s) ⇌ Ag+ (aq) + Cl- (aq)\n\nThe solubility product constant (Ksp) for AgCl is 1.8 x 10^-10.\n\nInitially, the solution contains 0.1 M AgCl and 0.1 M NaCl. When 0.01 moles of NaCl are added, the concentration of Cl- ions increases. Let's assume the volume of the solution is 1 L for simplicity.\n\nNew Cl- concentration = (0.1 + 0.01) M = 0.11 M\n\nSince a portion of AgCl precipitates out of the solution, let's assume x moles of AgCl dissolve to reach the new equilibrium.\n\nAg+ concentration = x M\nCl- concentration = 0.11 M\n\nNow, we can write the expression for Ksp:\n\nKsp = [Ag+] [Cl-] = (x)(0.11)\n\nGiven that Ksp for AgCl is 1.8 x 10^-10:\n\n1.8 x 10^-10 = (x)(0.11)\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx = 1.8 x 10^-10 / 0.11\nx ≈ 1.64 x 10^-9 M\n\nThis is the new concentration of Ag+ ions at equilibrium. Since the Ksp remains constant for a given salt at a constant temperature, the new equilibrium constant does not change. The equilibrium constant for the dissolution of AgCl remains the same, which is Ksp = 1.8 x 10^-10. However, the solubility of AgCl has decreased due to the common ion effect, as evidenced by the lower concentration of Ag+ ions in the solution."
