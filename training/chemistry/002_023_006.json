    "message_2": "To determine the conductivity of a 0.1 M solution of KCl at 25°C, we can use the equation:\n\nConductivity (κ) = Concentration (C) × Molar conductivity (Λm)\n\nMolar conductivity (Λm) is the conductivity of a 1 M solution of an electrolyte. For KCl, the molar conductivity at 25°C is approximately 149.9 S cm²/mol. \n\nNow, we can calculate the conductivity of a 0.1 M KCl solution:\n\nκ(KCl) = 0.1 M × 149.9 S cm²/mol = 14.99 S/m\n\nAs for the 0.1 M solution of glucose, glucose is a non-electrolyte, meaning it does not dissociate into ions when dissolved in water. Therefore, its conductivity will be significantly lower than that of an electrolyte like KCl. In fact, the conductivity of a glucose solution will be close to that of pure water, which is around 0.055 S/m at 25°C.\n\nComparing the conductivities:\n\nκ(KCl) = 14.99 S/m\nκ(glucose) ≈ 0.055 S/m\n\nThe conductivity of a 0.1 M KCl solution is significantly higher than that of a 0.1 M glucose solution at 25°C."
