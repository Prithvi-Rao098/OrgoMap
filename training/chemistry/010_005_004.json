The cell potential at standard conditions is observed to be 0.34 V. (Hint: Use the Nernst equation to relate the cell potential to the equilibrium constant.)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant for the reaction, we will use the Nernst equation, which relates the cell potential to the equilibrium constant. The Nernst equation is given by:\n\nE = E° - (RT/nF) * lnQ\n\nWhere:\nE = cell potential under non-standard conditions\nE° = cell potential under standard conditions\nR = gas constant (8.314 J/mol K)\nT = temperature (in Kelvin, assuming 298 K for room temperature)\nn = number of electrons transferred in the redox reaction\nF = Faraday's constant (96485 C/mol)\nQ = reaction quotient\n\nFor a copper electrode in a solution of 0.1 M copper(II) sulfate connected to a standard hydrogen electrode, the overall redox reaction is:\n\nCu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Cu(s)\n\nThe standard cell potential (E°) is given as 0.34 V. Since the reaction is at equilibrium, E = 0 V. The number of electrons transferred (n) is 2. We can now plug these values into the Nernst equation:\n\n0 = 0.34 - (8.314 * 298 / (2 * 96485)) * lnQ\n\nNow, we need to solve for Q:\n\n0.34 = (8.314 * 298 / (2 * 96485)) * lnQ\n0.34 * (2 * 96485) / (8.314 * 298) = lnQ\nQ = e^(0.34 * (2 * 96485) / (8.314 * 298))\nQ ≈ 10^10\n\nAt equilibrium, the reaction quotient (Q) is equal to the equilibrium constant (K):\n\nK ≈ 10^10\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium constant for the reaction is approximately 10^10."
