    "message_2": "To calculate the percent composition of phosphoric acid (H3PO4), we need to determine the molar mass of each element in the compound and then find the percentage of each element's mass relative to the total molar mass of the compound.\n\nFirst, let's find the molar mass of each element in H3PO4:\n- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol\n- Phosphorus (P): 30.97 g/mol\n- Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol\n\nNow, let's calculate the molar mass of H3PO4:\nMolar mass of H3PO4 = (3 × molar mass of H) + (1 × molar mass of P) + (4 × molar mass of O)\nMolar mass of H3PO4 = (3 × 1.008 g/mol) + (1 × 30.97 g/mol) + (4 × 16.00 g/mol)\nMolar mass of H3PO4 = 3.024 g/mol + 30.97 g/mol + 64.00 g/mol\nMolar mass of H3PO4 = 98.00 g/mol\n\nNow, let's calculate the percent composition of each element in H3PO4:\n\nPercent composition of Hydrogen (H):\n(3 × molar mass of H) / molar mass of H3PO4 × 100%\n(3 × 1.008 g/mol) / 98.00 g/mol × 100%\n3.024 g/mol / 98.00 g/mol × 100% ≈ 3.08%\n\nPercent composition of Phosphorus (P):\n(molar mass of P) / molar mass of H3PO4 × 100%\n(30.97 g/mol) / 98.00 g/mol × 100% ≈ 31.60%\n\nPercent composition of Oxygen (O):\n(4 × molar mass of O) / molar mass of H3PO4 × 100%\n(4 × 16.00 g/mol) / 98.00 g/mol × 100%\n64.00 g/mol / 98.00 g/mol × 100% ≈ 65.31%\n\nSo, the percent composition of phosphoric acid (H3PO4) is approximately:\n- Hydrogen (H): 3.08%\n- Phosphorus (P): 31.60%\n- Oxygen (O): 65.31%"
