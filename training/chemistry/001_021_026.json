    "message_2": "The elimination reaction of 2-bromo-2-methylbutane with potassium hydroxide in ethanol at 25°C is an E2 reaction. In this reaction, the base (potassium hydroxide) abstracts a proton from the β-carbon, and the bromide ion leaves simultaneously, forming a double bond between the α- and β-carbons.\n\nThere are two possible β-carbons in 2-bromo-2-methylbutane: one is the 3° carbon (C3) adjacent to the bromine, and the other is the 2° carbon (C1) at the other end of the molecule. The major product will be formed from the most stable alkene, which is the one with the most substituted double bond.\n\n1. Elimination at the 3° carbon (C3):\n\nIf the base abstracts a proton from the 3° carbon (C3), we will get a double bond between C2 and C3. The resulting alkene is 2-methyl-2-butene, which is a tetrasubstituted alkene.\n\n2. Elimination at the 2° carbon (C1):\n\nIf the base abstracts a proton from the 2° carbon (C1), we will get a double bond between C1 and C2. The resulting alkene is 3-methyl-1-butene, which is a trisubstituted alkene.\n\nThe major product will be the more stable alkene, which is 2-methyl-2-butene (the tetrasubstituted alkene). The minor product will be 3-methyl-1-butene (the trisubstituted alkene).\n\nSo, the major product is 2-methyl-2-butene, and the minor product is 3-methyl-1-butene. This is due to the fact that more substituted alkenes are more stable and favored in E2 reactions."
