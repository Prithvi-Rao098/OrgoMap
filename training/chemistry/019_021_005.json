The equation for the reaction is:\n\nCaO(s) + CO2(g) → CaCO3(s)\n\nGiven the standard enthalpy of formation values: ΔHf°[CaO(s)] = -635.09 kJ/mol, ΔHf°[CO2(g)] = -393.51 kJ/mol, and ΔHf°[CaCO3(s)] = -1207.44 kJ/mol.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH°(reaction) = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants)\n\nFirst, we need to determine the moles of each substance involved in the reaction. The balanced equation is:\n\n3 CaO(s) + 3 CO2(g) → 3 CaCO3(s)\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nΔH°(reaction) = [3 * ΔHf°(CaCO3)] - [3 * ΔHf°(CaO) + 3 * ΔHf°(CO2)]\n\nΔH°(reaction) = [3 * (-1207.44 kJ/mol)] - [3 * (-635.09 kJ/mol) + 3 * (-393.51 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH°(reaction) = [-3622.32 kJ] - [(-1905.27 kJ) + (-1180.53 kJ)]\n\nΔH°(reaction) = -3622.32 kJ + 3085.80 kJ\n\nΔH°(reaction) = -536.52 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the reaction is -536.52 kJ."
