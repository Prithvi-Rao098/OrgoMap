    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which reactant is the limiting reactant and how much of the excess reactant is left over after the reaction. The balanced chemical equation for the formation of water is:\n\n2 H₂(g) + O₂(g) → 2 H₂O(l)\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of each reactant:\n- Molar mass of H₂ = 2.02 g/mol\n- Molar mass of O₂ = 32.00 g/mol\n\nMoles of H₂ = (4.00 g) / (2.02 g/mol) = 1.98 mol\nMoles of O₂ = (16.00 g) / (32.00 g/mol) = 0.50 mol\n\nNow, we need to determine the limiting reactant by comparing the mole ratios:\n\nMole ratio of H₂ to O₂ in the balanced equation = 2:1\nMole ratio of H₂ to O₂ in the given amounts = (1.98 mol) / (0.50 mol) = 3.96\n\nSince the mole ratio of H₂ to O₂ in the given amounts (3.96) is greater than the mole ratio in the balanced equation (2), this means that O₂ is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow, we can find the amount of H₂ that reacts with the limiting reactant (O₂):\n\nMoles of H₂ that reacts = (0.50 mol O₂) × (2 mol H₂ / 1 mol O₂) = 1.00 mol H₂\n\nNow, we can find the amount of excess H₂ left over:\n\nMoles of H₂ left over = Initial moles of H₂ - Moles of H₂ that reacts\nMoles of H₂ left over = 1.98 mol - 1.00 mol = 0.98 mol\n\nFinally, we can convert the moles of excess H₂ back to grams:\n\nMass of H₂ left over = (0.98 mol) × (2.02 g/mol) = 1.98 g\n\nSo, 1.98 g of hydrogen gas is left over after the reaction."
