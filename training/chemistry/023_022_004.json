    "message_2": "The preparation of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid from benzoic acid and nitric acid involves the following steps:\n\n1. Nitration of benzoic acid: In this step, benzoic acid reacts with nitric acid to form 4-nitrobenzoic acid. The reaction is carried out in the presence of a catalyst, such as concentrated sulfuric acid.\n\n2. Nitration of 4-nitrobenzoic acid: In this step, 4-nitrobenzoic acid reacts with nitric acid to form 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid. The reaction is carried out in the presence of a catalyst, such as concentrated sulfuric acid.\n\nStep-by-step procedure:\n\n1. Dissolve 10 grams of benzoic acid in a mixture of 25 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid and 25 mL of concentrated nitric acid. The mixture should be cooled to 0°C using an ice bath.\n\n2. Stir the mixture for 30 minutes while maintaining the temperature at 0°C.\n\n3. Slowly raise the temperature to 50°C and maintain it for 2 hours.\n\n4. Cool the mixture to room temperature and then pour it into 200 mL of ice-cold water.\n\n5. Filter the precipitate formed, which is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.\n\n6. Dissolve the 4-nitrobenzoic acid in a mixture of 25 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid and 25 mL of concentrated nitric acid. The mixture should be cooled to 0°C using an ice bath.\n\n7. Stir the mixture for 30 minutes while maintaining the temperature at 0°C.\n\n8. Slowly raise the temperature to 50°C and maintain it for 2 hours.\n\n9. Cool the mixture to room temperature and then pour it into 200 mL of ice-cold water.\n\n10. Filter the precipitate formed, which is 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid.\n\n11. Wash the precipitate with cold water and then recrystallize it from a suitable solvent, such as ethanol or methanol, to obtain pure 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid.\n\nTo calculate the percentage yield:\n\n1. Determine the theoretical yield: The molecular weight of benzoic acid is 122.12 g/mol, and the molecular weight of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid is 212.14 g/mol. The stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, so the theoretical yield can be calculated as follows:\n\n(10 g benzoic acid) * (1 mol benzoic acid / 122.12 g) * (212.14 g 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid / 1 mol) = 17.36 g 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid\n\n2. Determine the actual yield: This value depends on the experimental results and may vary depending on factors such as reaction conditions and purity of the starting materials.\n\n3. Calculate the percentage yield: Divide the actual yield by the theoretical yield and multiply by 100.\n\nPercentage yield = (actual yield / theoretical yield) * 100\n\nWithout the actual yield value, it is not possible to provide a specific percentage yield for this reaction."
