    "message_2": "To calculate the pH of a 0.01 M solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl), we can use the formula:\n\npH = -log10[H+]\n\nSince HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates in water, meaning that the concentration of H+ ions is equal to the concentration of the HCl solution. In this case, the concentration of H+ ions is 0.01 M.\n\npH = -log10(0.01)\npH = 2\n\nConsidering the precision of the pH meter (± 0.02 pH units), the pH of the 0.01 M HCl solution at 25°C is 2.00 ± 0.02."
