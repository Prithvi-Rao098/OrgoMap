    "message_2": "The ionization of acetic acid (CH₃COOH) in water can be represented by the following chemical equation:\n\nCH₃COOH (aq) + H₂O (l) ⇌ CH₃COO⁻ (aq) + H₃O⁺ (aq)\n\nIn this reaction, acetic acid (CH₃COOH) donates a proton (H⁺) to water (H₂O), forming the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) and the hydronium ion (H₃O⁺).\n\nThe equilibrium constant expression for this reaction, known as the acid dissociation constant (Ka), can be written as:\n\nKa = [CH₃COO⁻][H₃O⁺] / [CH₃COOH]\n\nHere, [CH₃COO⁻] represents the equilibrium concentration of the acetate ion, [H₃O⁺] represents the equilibrium concentration of the hydronium ion, and [CH₃COOH] represents the equilibrium concentration of acetic acid.\n\nAt 25°C, the value of the equilibrium constant (Ka) for the ionization of acetic acid is approximately 1.8 x 10⁻⁵. This value indicates that the ionization of acetic acid in water is relatively weak, as the equilibrium lies towards the reactants (undissociated acetic acid) rather than the products (acetate and hydronium ions)."
