    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the vaporization of 50 grams of liquid water, we need to first determine the number of moles of water and then use the molar enthalpy of vaporization.\n\n1. Calculate the number of moles of water:\nThe molar mass of water (H2O) is 18.015 g/mol.\nNumber of moles = mass / molar mass\nNumber of moles = 50 g / 18.015 g/mol = 2.776 moles\n\n2. Calculate the standard enthalpy change:\nStandard enthalpy change = number of moles × molar enthalpy of vaporization\nStandard enthalpy change = 2.776 moles × 40.6 kJ/mol = 112.71 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the vaporization of 50 grams of liquid water at 100°C and 1 atm pressure is 112.71 kJ."
