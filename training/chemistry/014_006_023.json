    "message_2": "The coordination number of the central metal ion in the complex [Fe(CN)6]3- is 6. \n\nThe coordination number refers to the number of ligands (molecules or ions) that are directly bonded to the central metal ion in a coordination complex. In the given complex, [Fe(CN)6]3-, the central metal ion is Fe (iron), and the ligand is CN- (cyanide ion).\n\nThe complex has a formula of [Fe(CN)6]3-, which indicates that there are six cyanide ions (CN-) surrounding the central iron ion (Fe). Each cyanide ion forms a coordinate covalent bond with the iron ion, resulting in a total of six bonds between the iron and the cyanide ions.\n\nTherefore, the coordination number of the central metal ion (Fe) in the complex [Fe(CN)6]3- is 6. This means that the iron ion is surrounded by six cyanide ligands in its coordination sphere."
