    "message_2": "To determine the purity level of a given sample of paracetamol based on the melting point range obtained from the experiment, you need to compare the experimental melting point range with the known melting point range of pure paracetamol.\n\nThe melting point of pure paracetamol is approximately 169-170.5Â°C. When you perform the melting point experiment, you will obtain a melting point range for the sample. If the sample is pure, the melting point range should be very close to the known melting point range of pure paracetamol.\n\nIf the experimental melting point range is significantly lower or broader than the known melting point range, it indicates that the sample is impure. Impurities in the sample can cause the melting point to decrease and the range to broaden.\n\nTo determine the purity level, compare the experimental melting point range with the known melting point range of pure paracetamol. The closer the experimental range is to the known range, the higher the purity level of the sample."
