    "message_2": "To determine the enthalpy change for the given reaction, we can use the following formula:\n\nΔH∘reaction = Σ ΔH∘products - Σ ΔH∘reactants\n\nFirst, let's find the enthalpy change for the products:\n\n1 mol CO2: -393.5 kJ/mol\n2 mol H2O: 2 * -285.8 kJ/mol = -571.6 kJ\n\nΣ ΔH∘products = -393.5 kJ + (-571.6 kJ) = -965.1 kJ\n\nNow, let's find the enthalpy change for the reactants:\n\n1 mol CH4: -890.4 kJ/mol\n2 mol O2: 2 * 0 kJ/mol = 0 kJ\n\nΣ ΔH∘reactants = -890.4 kJ + 0 kJ = -890.4 kJ\n\nNow, we can find the enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nΔH∘reaction = Σ ΔH∘products - Σ ΔH∘reactants\nΔH∘reaction = -965.1 kJ - (-890.4 kJ)\nΔH∘reaction = -74.7 kJ/mol\n\nSince we have 2.50 moles of methane gas, the total enthalpy change for the reaction is:\n\nΔH∘total = ΔH∘reaction * moles of CH4\nΔH∘total = -74.7 kJ/mol * 2.50 mol\nΔH∘total = -186.75 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change when 2.50 moles of methane gas is combusted completely in oxygen gas is -186.75 kJ. The negative sign indicates that the reaction is exothermic, meaning heat is released."
