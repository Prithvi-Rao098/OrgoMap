    "message_2": "DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid) are both nucleic acids that play essential roles in the storage and expression of genetic information in living organisms. Although they share some similarities, there are several structural differences between DNA and RNA that affect their biological functions.\n\n1. Sugar component: The sugar component in the nucleotide building blocks of DNA and RNA is different. DNA contains deoxyribose sugar, while RNA contains ribose sugar. The difference lies in the presence of a hydroxyl group (-OH) at the 2' carbon in ribose sugar, whereas deoxyribose has only a hydrogen atom at the same position. This difference makes RNA more reactive and less stable than DNA, which is essential for its diverse roles in cellular processes.\n\n2. Bases: Both DNA and RNA contain four nitrogenous bases, but the bases differ between the two molecules. DNA contains adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T), while RNA contains adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and uracil (U) instead of thymine. This difference in bases affects the base pairing rules and the stability of the double-stranded structures formed by DNA and RNA.\n\n3. Structure: DNA is typically double-stranded, forming a double helix structure with two complementary strands running in opposite directions. This structure allows for the stable storage of genetic information and provides a template for replication during cell division. RNA, on the other hand, is usually single-stranded, which allows it to fold into various secondary and tertiary structures that are crucial for its diverse functions, such as catalyzing reactions, binding to proteins, and serving as templates for protein synthesis.\n\n4. Biological functions: DNA primarily serves as the genetic material for storing and transmitting genetic information from one generation to the next. It is responsible for encoding the information required for the synthesis of proteins and the regulation of cellular processes. RNA, in contrast, has multiple roles in the cell, including serving as a template for protein synthesis (messenger RNA or mRNA), forming the structural and catalytic components of the ribosome (ribosomal RNA or rRNA), and participating in the regulation of gene expression (transfer RNA or tRNA, and non-coding RNAs such as microRNAs).\n\nIn summary, the structural differences between DNA and RNA, including the sugar component, bases, and overall structure, contribute to their distinct biological functions. DNA is primarily responsible for the storage and transmission of genetic information, while RNA plays a more diverse role in gene expression, protein synthesis, and regulation of cellular processes."
