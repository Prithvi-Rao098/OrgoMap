    "message_2": "To determine the maximum possible surface area that can be occupied by nitrogen gas molecules on a sample of porous material using the BET (Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller) theory of multilayer adsorption, you need to know the following parameters:\n\n1. The mass of the porous material sample (m)\n2. The specific surface area of the porous material (SSA)\n3. The cross-sectional area of a nitrogen molecule (σ), which is approximately 0.162 nm²\n\nThe BET theory is based on the assumption that gas molecules can adsorb onto a solid surface in multiple layers. The specific surface area (SSA) is the surface area of the porous material per unit mass. To find the total surface area (TSA) of the porous material, multiply the specific surface area by the mass of the sample:\n\nTSA = SSA × m\n\nNow, to find the maximum possible surface area occupied by nitrogen gas molecules, divide the total surface area by the cross-sectional area of a nitrogen molecule:\n\nMaximum surface area occupied by N₂ molecules = TSA / σ\n\nBy plugging in the values for SSA, m, and σ, you can calculate the maximum possible surface area that can be occupied by nitrogen gas molecules on the sample of porous material using the BET theory of multilayer adsorption."
