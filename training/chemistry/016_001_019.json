    "message_2": "To find the enthalpy of formation of sodium chloride (NaCl), we need to consider the balanced chemical equation for the formation of NaCl from its elements in their standard states:\n\nNa(s) + 1/2 Cl2(g) → NaCl(s)\n\nThe enthalpy of formation of NaCl can be calculated using Hess's Law, which states that the total enthalpy change for a reaction is the sum of the enthalpy changes for each step in the reaction, regardless of the order of the steps.\n\nIn this case, we have the enthalpies of formation for Na(s) and Cl2(g), but we want to find the enthalpy of formation for NaCl(s). We can use the following equation:\n\nΔHf(NaCl) = ΔHf(Na) + 1/2 ΔHf(Cl2) - ΔHf(NaCl)\n\nSince the enthalpy of formation for an element in its standard state is zero, we have:\n\nΔHf(NaCl) = 0 + 1/2(-244 kJ/mol) - (-107 kJ/mol)\n\nΔHf(NaCl) = -122 kJ/mol + 107 kJ/mol\n\nΔHf(NaCl) = -15 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the enthalpy of formation of sodium chloride (NaCl) is -15 kJ/mol."
