    "message_2": "To determine the empirical formula, we first need to convert the percentages to grams. Assuming we have a 100 g sample of the compound, we would have:\n\n29.17 g of sodium (Na)\n12.19 g of sulfur (S)\n58.64 g of oxygen (O)\n\nNext, we need to convert these masses to moles by dividing by the molar mass of each element:\n\nMoles of Na = 29.17 g / 22.99 g/mol = 1.268 mol\nMoles of S = 12.19 g / 32.07 g/mol = 0.380 mol\nMoles of O = 58.64 g / 16.00 g/mol = 3.665 mol\n\nNow, we need to find the mole ratio by dividing each number of moles by the smallest number of moles:\n\nMole ratio of Na = 1.268 / 0.380 = 3.34 ≈ 3\nMole ratio of S = 0.380 / 0.380 = 1\nMole ratio of O = 3.665 / 0.380 = 9.65 ≈ 10\n\nSo, the empirical formula is Na3S1O10 or Na3SO10.\n\nTo determine the molecular formula, we need to find the molar mass of the empirical formula:\n\nMolar mass of Na3SO10 = (3 × 22.99) + (1 × 32.07) + (10 × 16.00) = 68.97 + 32.07 + 160.00 = 261.04 g/mol\n\nNow, we will divide the molar mass of the compound by the molar mass of the empirical formula to find the ratio between them:\n\nRatio = 342.2 g/mol / 261.04 g/mol = 1.31 ≈ 1\n\nSince the ratio is approximately 1, the molecular formula is the same as the empirical formula, which is Na3SO10."
