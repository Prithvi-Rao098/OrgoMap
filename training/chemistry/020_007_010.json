    "message_1": "How does increasing the pressure affect the equilibrium position of the following reaction at constant temperature: \n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g) \n\nProvide the direction of the shift (left or right), and explain the reasoning behind your answer using Le Chatelier's principle.",
    "message_2": "Increasing the pressure of the system will affect the equilibrium position of the reaction N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g) by shifting it to the side with fewer moles of gas. In this case, the equilibrium will shift to the right. \n\nLe Chatelier's principle states that when a system at equilibrium experiences a change in pressure, temperature, or concentration, the system will adjust itself to counteract the change and restore a new equilibrium. \n\nIn this reaction, there are 4 moles of gas on the left side (1 mole of N2 and 3 moles of H2) and 2 moles of gas on the right side (2 moles of NH3). When the pressure is increased, the system will try to counteract the change by reducing the pressure. It does this by shifting the equilibrium position to the side with fewer moles of gas, which in this case is the right side (formation of NH3). \n\nSo, increasing the pressure will shift the equilibrium position to the right, favoring the formation of NH3."
