    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for dissolving sodium chloride in water, we need to know the enthalpy of dissolution of NaCl. Unfortunately, the enthalpy of formation of NaCl provided (-411.1 kJ/mol) is not the same as the enthalpy of dissolution. The enthalpy of dissolution is the energy change when one mole of a solute dissolves in a solvent.\n\nThe enthalpy of dissolution of NaCl is +3.88 kJ/mol. Now we can proceed with the calculation.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the number of moles of NaCl in 10 grams:\nMolar mass of NaCl = 58.44 g/mol (22.99 g/mol for Na + 35.45 g/mol for Cl)\nmoles of NaCl = (10 g) / (58.44 g/mol) = 0.1711 mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change for dissolving 0.1711 mol of NaCl:\nΔH = (0.1711 mol) * (+3.88 kJ/mol) = +0.664 kJ\n\nSo, the enthalpy change for dissolving 10 grams of sodium chloride in 100 mL of water at 25°C is approximately +0.664 kJ."
