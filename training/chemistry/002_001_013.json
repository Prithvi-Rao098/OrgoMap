    "message_2": "First, let's write the balanced chemical equation for this reaction:\n\nNaOH + HCl → NaCl + H2O\n\nThe mole ratio of NaOH to HCl is 1:1, as seen in the balanced equation.\n\nNow, let's determine the limiting reagent. First, we need to find the moles of each reactant:\n\nMoles of NaOH = mass / molar mass\nMoles of NaOH = 10 g / (22.99 g/mol + 15.999 g/mol + 1.007 g/mol) = 10 g / 39.996 g/mol ≈ 0.250 moles\n\nMoles of HCl = mass / molar mass\nMoles of HCl = 20 g / (1.007 g/mol + 35.453 g/mol) = 20 g / 36.460 g/mol ≈ 0.548 moles\n\nSince the mole ratio of NaOH to HCl is 1:1, NaOH is the limiting reagent because there are fewer moles of NaOH than HCl.\n\nNow, let's find the amount of excess HCl left over:\n\nMoles of excess HCl = moles of HCl - moles of NaOH = 0.548 moles - 0.250 moles = 0.298 moles\n\nMass of excess HCl = moles * molar mass = 0.298 moles * 36.460 g/mol ≈ 10.87 g\n\nNow, let's find the mass of NaCl and H2O produced:\n\nMoles of NaCl = moles of NaOH (since the mole ratio is 1:1) = 0.250 moles\nMass of NaCl = moles * molar mass = 0.250 moles * (22.99 g/mol + 35.453 g/mol) = 0.250 moles * 58.443 g/mol ≈ 14.61 g\n\nMoles of H2O = moles of NaOH (since the mole ratio is 1:1) = 0.250 moles\nMass of H2O = moles * molar mass = 0.250 moles * (2 * 1.007 g/mol + 15.999 g/mol) = 0.250 moles * 18.015 g/mol ≈ 4.50 g\n\nIn summary:\n\n- Limiting reagent: NaOH\n- Excess reagent: HCl, with 10.87 g left over\n- Mass of NaCl produced: 14.61 g\n- Mass of H2O produced: 4.50 g"
