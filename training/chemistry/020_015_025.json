    "message_2": "Before the addition of hydrochloric acid:\n\nWe can use the Ka expression to find the percent ionization of the acetic acid solution.\n\nKa = [H+][A-]/[HA]\n\nLet x be the concentration of [H+] and [A-] at equilibrium. Then, the Ka expression becomes:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 = x^2 / (0.1 - x)\n\nAssuming x is small compared to 0.1, we can approximate:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 ≈ x^2 / 0.1\n\nx^2 ≈ 1.8 x 10^-6\n\nx ≈ 1.34 x 10^-3 M\n\nPercent ionization = (x / initial concentration) * 100\nPercent ionization ≈ (1.34 x 10^-3 / 0.1) * 100 ≈ 1.34%\n\nThe pH of the solution can be calculated using the formula:\n\npH = -log10[H+]\npH ≈ -log10(1.34 x 10^-3) ≈ 2.87\n\nAfter the addition of 0.05 M hydrochloric acid:\n\nThe strong acid HCl will react with the acetic acid (CH3COOH) to form its conjugate base (CH3COO-) and water.\n\nCH3COOH + HCl → CH3COO- + H2O\n\nSince HCl is a strong acid, it will react completely with the acetic acid. The limiting reactant is HCl, so the reaction will consume 0.05 moles of acetic acid and produce 0.05 moles of acetate ion (CH3COO-).\n\nNew concentrations:\n[CH3COOH] = 0.1 - 0.05 = 0.05 M\n[CH3COO-] = 0.05 M\n\nNow, we need to find the new [H+] concentration. We can use the Ka expression again:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 = [H+][CH3COO-] / [CH3COOH]\n\nLet x be the new [H+] concentration. Then:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 = x(0.05) / 0.05\n\nx ≈ 1.8 x 10^-5 M\n\nPercent ionization after the addition of HCl = (1.8 x 10^-5 / 0.05) * 100 ≈ 0.036%\n\nThe pH of the solution after the addition of HCl can be calculated using the formula:\n\npH = -log10[H+]\npH ≈ -log10(1.8 x 10^-5) ≈ 4.74\n\nIn summary, the percent ionization of the acetic acid solution decreases from 1.34% to 0.036% after the addition of 0.05 M hydrochloric acid, and the pH of the solution changes from 2.87 to 4.74."
