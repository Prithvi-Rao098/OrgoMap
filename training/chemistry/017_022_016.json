    "message_2": "The photochemical properties of enantiomers of a chiral molecule can differ due to their distinct spatial arrangements. This difference can affect their reactivity and reaction mechanisms in photochemical reactions.\n\n1. Absorption of light: Enantiomers can have different absorption spectra when interacting with circularly polarized light. One enantiomer may preferentially absorb left-circularly polarized light, while the other absorbs right-circularly polarized light. This difference in absorption can lead to different reactivity when exposed to specific light sources.\n\n2. Excited state conformation: Upon light absorption, enantiomers can undergo conformational changes in their excited states. These changes can lead to different reaction pathways and products for each enantiomer.\n\n3. Stereoselectivity: In photochemical reactions involving chiral molecules, the stereochemistry of the reactants can influence the stereochemistry of the products. Enantiomers can have different reactivity with other chiral molecules, leading to stereoselective reactions that produce different diastereomers or enantiomers as products.\n\n4. Reaction mechanism: The distinct spatial arrangement of enantiomers can lead to different reaction mechanisms in photochemical reactions. For example, one enantiomer may undergo a concerted reaction mechanism, while the other enantiomer undergoes a stepwise mechanism. This can result in different reaction rates and product distributions.\n\nIn summary, the photochemical properties of enantiomers of a chiral molecule can differ due to their unique spatial arrangements, leading to differences in light absorption, excited state conformations, stereoselectivity, and reaction mechanisms. These differences can significantly impact the reactivity and product distribution in photochemical reactions."
