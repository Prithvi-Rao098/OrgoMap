    "message_2": "The dipole moment of a molecule is calculated using the formula:\n\nDipole moment (µ) = Charge (Q) × Bond length (d)\n\nFor hydrogen fluoride (HF), the bond length (d) is approximately 0.92 Å (9.2 × 10^-11 m) and the charge difference (Q) between hydrogen and fluorine is approximately 0.42 e (elementary charge), where 1 e is equal to 1.602 × 10^-19 C (Coulombs).\n\nNow, we can calculate the dipole moment:\n\nµ = Q × d\nµ = (0.42 e) × (9.2 × 10^-11 m)\n\nTo convert the elementary charge to Coulombs:\n\nµ = (0.42 × 1.602 × 10^-19 C) × (9.2 × 10^-11 m)\nµ ≈ 6.73 × 10^-30 C·m\n\nSo, the dipole moment of hydrogen fluoride (HF) molecule is approximately 6.73 × 10^-30 C·m."
