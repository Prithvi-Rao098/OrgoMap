    "message_2": "In the molecule of methane (CH4), the central carbon atom forms sp3 hybrid orbitals. This hybridization occurs when the carbon atom combines its three 2p orbitals and one 2s orbital to form four new, equivalent sp3 hybrid orbitals. These orbitals are then used to form four sigma bonds with four hydrogen atoms, resulting in a tetrahedral geometry around the carbon atom."
