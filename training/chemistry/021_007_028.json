    "message_2": "To calculate the formal charge of the nitrogen atom in the NH3 molecule, we will use the following formula:\n\nFormal charge = (Valence electrons of the atom) - (Non-bonding electrons) - 1/2(Bonding electrons)\n\nStep 1: Determine the valence electrons of the nitrogen atom.\nNitrogen is in group 15 of the periodic table, so it has 5 valence electrons.\n\nStep 2: Determine the non-bonding electrons.\nIn NH3, nitrogen is bonded to three hydrogen atoms, and it also has one lone pair of electrons. The non-bonding electrons are the lone pair electrons, which is 2.\n\nStep 3: Determine the bonding electrons.\nEach nitrogen-hydrogen bond has 2 electrons, and there are three such bonds in NH3. So, there are a total of 2 x 3 = 6 bonding electrons.\n\nNow, we can calculate the formal charge of the nitrogen atom:\n\nFormal charge = (5) - (2) - 1/2(6)\nFormal charge = 5 - 2 - 3\nFormal charge = 0\n\nThe formal charge of the nitrogen atom in NH3 is 0. This means that the nitrogen atom has a neutral charge in this molecule. The significance of this result is that the molecule is stable and the distribution of electrons around the nitrogen atom is balanced."
