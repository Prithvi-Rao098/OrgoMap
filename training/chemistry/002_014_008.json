    "message_2": "To calculate the formal charge of each atom in the nitrate ion (NO3^-), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the number of valence electrons for each atom.\n2. Calculate the number of non-bonding electrons for each atom.\n3. Calculate the number of bonding electrons for each atom.\n4. Calculate the formal charge for each atom.\n\nStep 1: Determine the number of valence electrons for each atom.\n- Nitrogen (N) has 5 valence electrons.\n- Oxygen (O) has 6 valence electrons.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of non-bonding electrons for each atom.\nIn the nitrate ion, there are three oxygen atoms. Two of them are single-bonded to the nitrogen atom and have three lone pairs (6 non-bonding electrons). The third oxygen atom is double-bonded to the nitrogen atom and has two lone pairs (4 non-bonding electrons).\n\nStep 3: Calculate the number of bonding electrons for each atom.\n- Nitrogen (N) forms one double bond and two single bonds, so it has 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 bonding electrons.\n- Oxygen (O) forms one double bond and two single bonds (in total), so it has 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 bonding electrons.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the formal charge for each atom.\nFormal charge = (valence electrons) - (non-bonding electrons) - (1/2 * bonding electrons)\n\n- Nitrogen (N): Formal charge = 5 - 0 - (1/2 * 4) = 5 - 2 = +1\n- Oxygen (O) with single bond: Formal charge = 6 - 6 - (1/2 * 2) = 6 - 6 - 1 = -1\n- Oxygen (O) with double bond: Formal charge = 6 - 4 - (1/2 * 4) = 6 - 4 - 2 = 0\n\nSo, the formal charges for the nitrate ion (NO3^-) are:\n- Nitrogen (N): +1\n- Oxygen (O) with single bond: -1 (for each of the two oxygen atoms)\n- Oxygen (O) with double bond: 0"
