    "message_2": "To determine the selectivity and activity of a catalyst for a specific chemical reaction using quantum chemistry calculations, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose a chemical reaction and the catalysts to be compared: Select a specific chemical reaction and identify the existing catalyst and the new catalyst to be studied.\n\n2. Build the molecular models: Construct the molecular models of the reactants, products, and catalysts using appropriate software, such as Gaussian, ORCA, or GAMESS.\n\n3. Perform quantum chemistry calculations: Carry out quantum chemistry calculations, such as density functional theory (DFT) or ab initio methods, to obtain the electronic structure and energetics of the reactants, products, and catalysts. These calculations will provide information on the reaction pathways, transition states, and energy barriers.\n\n4. Calculate selectivity and activity: Using the obtained energy profiles, calculate the selectivity and activity of the catalysts. Selectivity is determined by comparing the energy barriers of the desired reaction pathway to the energy barriers of competing pathways. Activity can be assessed by comparing the energy barriers of the rate-determining step in the reaction pathway for both the existing and new catalysts.\n\n5. Compare the catalysts: Analyze the results to determine if the new catalyst has improved selectivity and/or activity compared to the existing catalyst.\n\n6. Design better catalysts: Based on the results, identify the key factors that contribute to the improved performance of the new catalyst. This could include factors such as the electronic properties of the catalyst, steric effects, or the stability of intermediates. Use this information to design better catalysts by modifying the structure or composition of the catalyst to further enhance its selectivity and activity.\n\nIn summary, quantum chemistry calculations can provide valuable insights into the selectivity and activity of catalysts for specific chemical reactions. By comparing the performance of new and existing catalysts, we can identify the key factors that contribute to their performance and use this information to design better catalysts for the reaction."
