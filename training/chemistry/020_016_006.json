    "message_2": "When sodium chloride (NaCl) is added to a solution containing silver chloride (AgCl), the solubility of AgCl decreases. This is due to the common ion effect, which states that the solubility of a sparingly soluble salt decreases in the presence of a common ion.\n\nIn this case, both AgCl and NaCl share a common ion, which is the chloride ion (Cl-). When NaCl is added to the solution, the concentration of Cl- ions increases. According to Le Chatelier's principle, the equilibrium will shift to counteract this change, and in this case, it will shift to the left (towards the solid AgCl) to reduce the concentration of Cl- ions. As a result, the solubility of AgCl decreases.\n\nTo calculate the change in solubility, you can use the solubility product constant (Ksp) and the common ion effect. The Ksp expression for AgCl is:\n\nKsp = [Ag+][Cl-]\n\nFirst, find the initial solubility of AgCl in pure water by using its Ksp value. For AgCl, Ksp = 1.77 x 10^-10. In pure water, the solubility of AgCl can be represented as:\n\nKsp = [Ag+][Cl-] = (s)(s) = s^2\n\nSolve for s (solubility of AgCl in pure water):\n\ns = √(Ksp) = √(1.77 x 10^-10) = 1.33 x 10^-5 M\n\nNow, consider the addition of NaCl. Let the concentration of NaCl added be 'c'. Since NaCl is a strong electrolyte, it will dissociate completely, and the concentration of Cl- ions from NaCl will be equal to 'c'. The new equilibrium concentrations of Ag+ and Cl- ions will be:\n\n[Ag+] = s\n[Cl-] = s + c\n\nNow, substitute these values into the Ksp expression:\n\nKsp = [Ag+][Cl-] = s(s + c)\n\nSince Ksp remains constant, you can solve for the new solubility (s) of AgCl in the presence of NaCl:\n\ns = Ksp / (s + c)\n\nYou can now calculate the change in solubility by comparing the initial solubility (s in pure water) and the new solubility (s in the presence of NaCl)."
