    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the equilibrium constant (Ka) for the dissociation of the weak acid HA. We are given the following information:\n\n1. 0.10 moles of HA are dissolved in 1.00 L of water.\n2. The pH of the solution is 4.20.\n3. The acid is 10% ionized.\n\nFirst, let's write the dissociation equation for the weak acid HA:\n\nHA ⇌ H⁺ + A⁻\n\nSince the acid is 10% ionized, we know that 10% of the 0.10 moles of HA have dissociated into H⁺ and A⁻ ions. Therefore, the concentration of H⁺ ions is:\n\n[H⁺] = 0.10 moles × 0.10 = 0.010 moles\n\nNow, we can use the pH formula to find the concentration of H⁺ ions:\n\npH = -log[H⁺]\n\n4.20 = -log[H⁺]\n\nTo find [H⁺], we need to take the inverse log (antilog) of both sides:\n\n[H⁺] = 10^(-4.20) ≈ 6.31 × 10^(-5) M\n\nSince the concentration of H⁺ ions is 0.010 moles, and we calculated [H⁺] to be 6.31 × 10^(-5) M, we can now find the concentration of A⁻ ions, which is equal to the concentration of H⁺ ions:\n\n[A⁻] = [H⁺] = 6.31 × 10^(-5) M\n\nNow, we can find the concentration of the undissociated HA:\n\n[HA] = 0.10 moles - 0.010 moles = 0.090 moles\n\nSince the volume of the solution is 1.00 L, the molar concentration of HA is:\n\n[HA] = 0.090 moles / 1.00 L = 0.090 M\n\nFinally, we can calculate the equilibrium constant (Ka) using the equilibrium expression:\n\nKa = [H⁺][A⁻] / [HA]\n\nKa = (6.31 × 10^(-5) M)(6.31 × 10^(-5) M) / (0.090 M)\n\nKa ≈ 4.42 × 10^(-6)\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (Ka) for the dissociation of the weak acid HA is approximately 4.42 × 10^(-6)."
