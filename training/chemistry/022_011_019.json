(Assuming the reaction goes to completion and all gas is collected).",
    "message_2": "The balanced chemical equation for the reaction between sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) is:\n\nH2SO4 + CaCO3 â†’ CaSO4 + H2O + CO2\n\nFirst, we need to determine the limiting reactant. To do this, we'll calculate the moles of each reactant:\n\nMoles of H2SO4 = mass / molar mass = 10 g / (2*1 + 32 + 4*16) g/mol = 10 g / 98 g/mol = 0.102 mol\n\nMoles of CaCO3 = mass / molar mass = 20 g / (40 + 12 + 3*16) g/mol = 20 g / 100 g/mol = 0.200 mol\n\nNow, we'll compare the mole ratio of the reactants to the stoichiometry of the balanced equation:\n\nMole ratio = moles of H2SO4 / moles of CaCO3 = 0.102 mol / 0.200 mol = 0.51\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the balanced equation is 1:1, H2SO4 is the limiting reactant. Therefore, the amount of CO2 produced will be based on the moles of H2SO4.\n\nAt standard temperature and pressure (STP), 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters. So, the volume of CO2 produced can be calculated as follows:\n\nVolume of CO2 = moles of H2SO4 * 22.4 L/mol = 0.102 mol * 22.4 L/mol = 2.28 L\n\nThus, the total volume of gas released at STP when 10 grams of H2SO4 is added to 20 grams of CaCO3 in a closed container at 25 degrees Celsius is 2.28 liters."
