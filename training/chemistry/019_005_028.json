    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) for the reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°\n\nwhere ΔH° is the change in enthalpy, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ΔS° is the change in entropy.\n\nGiven the data:\n\nΔH° = -1268.0 kJ/mol\nΔS° = -198.5 J/mol*K\nT = 298 K\n\nFirst, we need to convert ΔS° from J/mol*K to kJ/mol*K:\n\nΔS° = -198.5 J/mol*K × (1 kJ / 1000 J) = -0.1985 kJ/mol*K\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the equation:\n\nΔG° = (-1268.0 kJ/mol) - (298 K × -0.1985 kJ/mol*K)\nΔG° = -1268.0 kJ/mol + 59.2 kJ/mol\nΔG° = -1208.8 kJ/mol\n\nThe Gibbs free energy change for the reaction of 2 moles of ammonia with 3 moles of oxygen to produce 2 moles of nitrogen gas and 3 moles of water vapor is -1208.8 kJ/mol."
