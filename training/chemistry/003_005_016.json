    "message_2": "To determine the shape of the molecules PF3 and SF6, we will first look at their Lewis structures and then use the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory to predict their molecular geometries. Finally, we will discuss their polarity based on their shapes.\n\n1. PF3 (Phosphorus Trifluoride) molecule:\n\nLewis structure: Phosphorus (P) is the central atom, surrounded by three Fluorine (F) atoms and one lone pair of electrons.\n\nP: 5 valence electrons\nF: 7 valence electrons (each)\nTotal valence electrons: 5 + 3(7) = 26\n\nThe Lewis structure for PF3 is:\n\n       F\n       |\nP - F - F\n       :\n(Lone pair on P)\n\nVSEPR theory: The central atom P has four electron groups (three bonding pairs and one lone pair). According to VSEPR theory, these electron groups will arrange themselves to minimize repulsion, resulting in a trigonal pyramidal geometry.\n\nMolecular geometry: Trigonal pyramidal\n\nPolarity: In PF3, the individual P-F bonds are polar due to the electronegativity difference between P and F atoms. The trigonal pyramidal geometry does not cancel out the bond dipoles, resulting in a net molecular dipole moment. Therefore, PF3 is a polar molecule.\n\n2. SF6 (Sulfur Hexafluoride) molecule:\n\nLewis structure: Sulfur (S) is the central atom, surrounded by six Fluorine (F) atoms.\n\nS: 6 valence electrons\nF: 7 valence electrons (each)\nTotal valence electrons: 6 + 6(7) = 48\n\nThe Lewis structure for SF6 is:\n\n       F\n       |\nF - S - F\n   |   |\n   F   F\n       |\n       F\n\nVSEPR theory: The central atom S has six electron groups (six bonding pairs and no lone pairs). According to VSEPR theory, these electron groups will arrange themselves to minimize repulsion, resulting in an octahedral geometry.\n\nMolecular geometry: Octahedral\n\nPolarity: In SF6, the individual S-F bonds are polar due to the electronegativity difference between S and F atoms. However, the octahedral geometry causes the bond dipoles to cancel each other out, resulting in no net molecular dipole moment. Therefore, SF6 is a nonpolar molecule.\n\nIn summary, PF3 has a trigonal pyramidal geometry and is a polar molecule, while SF6 has an octahedral geometry and is a nonpolar molecule."
