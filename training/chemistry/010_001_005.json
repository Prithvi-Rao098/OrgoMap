    "message_1": "Sure, here is a precise problem for a chemistry student to solve:\n\nCalculate the standard electrode potential for the reaction Pb2+(aq) + 2e− -> Pb(s) given that the standard reduction potential for Pb2+(aq) is -0.126 V and the standard reduction potential for Pb(s) is 0.00 V.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard electrode potential for the given reaction, we can use the Nernst equation. However, since we are dealing with standard conditions, the equation simplifies to:\n\nE_cell = E_cathode - E_anode\n\nIn this case, the reaction is a reduction reaction, so the standard reduction potential for Pb2+(aq) will be the cathode potential, and the standard reduction potential for Pb(s) will be the anode potential.\n\nE_cathode = -0.126 V (given for Pb2+(aq))\nE_anode = 0.00 V (given for Pb(s))\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nE_cell = (-0.126 V) - (0.00 V)\nE_cell = -0.126 V\n\nSo, the standard electrode potential for the reaction Pb2+(aq) + 2e− -> Pb(s) is -0.126 V."
