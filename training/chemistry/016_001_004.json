    "message_2": "We are given the following information:\n\n1. The standard enthalpy of combustion of carbon to CO2 (ΔHc°(C)) is -393.5 kJ/mol.\n2. The standard enthalpy of combustion of hydrogen to H2O (ΔHc°(H2)) is -285.8 kJ/mol.\n3. The standard enthalpy of formation of water (ΔHf°(H2O)) is -241.8 kJ/mol.\n\nWe want to find the standard enthalpy of formation of carbon dioxide (ΔHf°(CO2)).\n\nSince the standard enthalpy of formation of an element in its standard state is zero, we can write the following equations for the combustion reactions:\n\nΔHc°(C) = ΔHf°(CO2) - ΔHf°(C) = -393.5 kJ/mol (1)\nΔHc°(H2) = ΔHf°(H2O) - ΔHf°(H2) = -285.8 kJ/mol (2)\n\nWe can rearrange equation (1) to find ΔHf°(CO2):\n\nΔHf°(CO2) = ΔHc°(C) + ΔHf°(C) = -393.5 kJ/mol + 0 = -393.5 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy of formation of carbon dioxide from its elements under standard conditions is -393.5 kJ/mol."
