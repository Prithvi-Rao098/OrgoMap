    "message_1": "Sure, here's a sample problem:\n\nA certain electrochemical reaction has a standard electrode potential of -0.76 V. The reaction involves the oxidation of zinc metal and the reduction of copper (II) ions to copper metal. If a current of 2 A is applied to a cell containing 1.0 M ZnSO4 and 0.10 M CuSO4 separated by a salt bridge, how long will it take to plate out 1.25 g of copper metal onto the cathode electrode? Assume 100% current efficiency and that all other factors remain constant.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we'll use Faraday's Law of Electrolysis, which states that the mass of a substance deposited or dissolved at an electrode is directly proportional to the amount of charge passed through the electrolyte.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the number of moles of copper that need to be plated out. The molar mass of copper (Cu) is 63.55 g/mol.\n\nmoles of Cu = (mass of Cu) / (molar mass of Cu)\nmoles of Cu = (1.25 g) / (63.55 g/mol) = 0.0197 mol\n\nThe balanced half-reaction for the reduction of copper (II) ions to copper metal is:\n\nCu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu\n\nFrom the balanced half-reaction, we can see that 2 moles of electrons are required to reduce 1 mole of Cu²⁺ ions to Cu metal. Therefore, we need to determine the total moles of electrons needed to plate out 0.0197 mol of Cu.\n\nmoles of electrons = 2 * moles of Cu = 2 * 0.0197 mol = 0.0394 mol\n\nNow, we need to convert moles of electrons to coulombs (C) using Faraday's constant (F), which is approximately 96485 C/mol.\n\ncharge (Q) = moles of electrons * Faraday's constant\nQ = 0.0394 mol * 96485 C/mol = 3801.5 C\n\nFinally, we can calculate the time (t) required to plate out 1.25 g of copper metal using the given current (I) of 2 A.\n\ntime (t) = charge (Q) / current (I)\nt = 3801.5 C / 2 A = 1900.75 s\n\nSo, it will take approximately 1900.75 seconds (or about 31.68 minutes) to plate out 1.25 g of copper metal onto the cathode electrode, assuming 100% current efficiency and all other factors remaining constant."
