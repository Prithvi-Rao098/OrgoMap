    "message_2": "To calculate the maximum work that can be obtained in a non-equilibrium process, we can use the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) equation. The Gibbs free energy change is the maximum reversible work that can be done by a system at constant temperature and pressure.\n\nΔG = ΔH - TΔS\n\nWhere ΔG is the Gibbs free energy change, ΔH is the enthalpy change, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ΔS is the entropy change.\n\nFor an ideal gas, the enthalpy change (ΔH) can be calculated using the equation:\n\nΔH = nCpΔT\n\nWhere n is the number of moles, Cp is the heat capacity at constant pressure, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nHowever, we are given only the entropy change (ΔS) and not the enthalpy change (ΔH) or the temperature change (ΔT). Therefore, we cannot calculate the maximum work directly using the given information.\n\nTo proceed, we would need additional information such as the initial and final states of the system, the heat capacity at constant pressure (Cp), or the enthalpy change (ΔH). With this information, we could then calculate the maximum work that can be obtained in the non-equilibrium process."
