    "message_2": "To determine the concentration of copper ions in a given water sample using polarography analysis, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Prepare the water sample: Filter the water sample to remove any suspended particles and adjust the pH if necessary.\n\n2. Prepare the polarographic cell: Set up the polarographic cell with a dropping mercury electrode (DME) as the working electrode, a reference electrode (e.g., Ag/AgCl), and an auxiliary electrode.\n\n3. Add supporting electrolyte: Add an appropriate supporting electrolyte (e.g., KCl) to the water sample to ensure a constant ionic strength.\n\n4. Perform the polarographic analysis: Carry out the polarographic analysis by applying a potential to the working electrode and measuring the current response. The potential should be scanned from a value where no reduction of copper ions occurs to a value where the reduction of copper ions is complete.\n\n5. Record the polarogram: Plot the current response against the applied potential to obtain a polarogram. The polarogram will show a characteristic wave for the reduction of copper ions.\n\n6. Determine the half-wave potential: Identify the half-wave potential (E1/2) from the polarogram, which corresponds to the potential at which half of the maximum current is observed.\n\n7. Calibration: Prepare a series of standard solutions with known concentrations of copper ions and perform polarographic analysis on each of them. Plot the peak current (ip) against the concentration of copper ions to obtain a calibration curve.\n\n8. Calculate the concentration of copper ions in the water sample: Measure the peak current (ip) for the water sample and use the calibration curve to determine the concentration of copper ions in the sample.\n\nKeep in mind that the accuracy of the results depends on the quality of the polarographic analysis, the calibration curve, and the sample preparation."
