The heat capacity of the calorimeter is 25.2 J/°C and the initial and final temperatures were 24.0°C and 29.2°C respectively.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to calculate the moles of NaOH dissolved:\n\nMolar mass of NaOH = 22.99 g/mol (Na) + 15.999 g/mol (O) + 1.007 g/mol (H) = 39.996 g/mol\n\nmoles of NaOH = (2.50 g) / (39.996 g/mol) = 0.0625 mol\n\nNext, we need to calculate the heat absorbed by the calorimeter:\n\nΔT = T_final - T_initial = 29.2°C - 24.0°C = 5.2°C\n\nq_calorimeter = C_calorimeter * ΔT = 25.2 J/°C * 5.2°C = 131.04 J\n\nSince the heat absorbed by the calorimeter is equal to the heat released by the dissolution reaction, we have:\n\nq_reaction = -131.04 J = -0.13104 kJ\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change of the dissolution reaction per mole of NaOH:\n\nΔH_reaction = q_reaction / moles of NaOH = (-0.13104 kJ) / (0.0625 mol) = -2.09664 kJ/mol\n\nFinally, we can calculate the standard enthalpy change of the dissolution reaction using the molar enthalpy of hydration of Na+ and OH- ions:\n\nΔH_dissolution = ΔH_reaction - ΔH_hydration(Na+) - ΔH_hydration(OH-)\n\nΔH_dissolution = -2.09664 kJ/mol - (-406.8 kJ/mol) - (-230.0 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH_dissolution = 634.70336 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change of the dissolution reaction of NaOH in water is approximately 634.7 kJ/mol."
