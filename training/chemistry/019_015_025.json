    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the fusion of 10 grams of ice at 0°C to liquid water at 25°C, we need to consider two processes: \n\n1. Melting of ice at 0°C to liquid water at 0°C\n2. Heating the liquid water from 0°C to 25°C\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of moles of ice. The molar mass of water (H2O) is 18.015 g/mol.\n\nNumber of moles = (mass of ice) / (molar mass of water)\nNumber of moles = 10 g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ 0.555 mol\n\nNow, let's calculate the enthalpy change for each process.\n\n1. Melting of ice at 0°C to liquid water at 0°C:\nEnthalpy change (ΔH1) = (number of moles) × (standard enthalpy of fusion)\nΔH1 = 0.555 mol × 6.01 kJ/mol ≈ 3.34 kJ\n\n2. Heating the liquid water from 0°C to 25°C:\nEnthalpy change (ΔH2) = (mass of water) × (specific heat capacity of water) × (change in temperature)\nΔH2 = 10 g × 4.18 J/g°C × 25°C ≈ 1045 J = 1.045 kJ\n\nFinally, let's add the enthalpy changes for both processes to get the total standard enthalpy change.\n\nTotal standard enthalpy change (ΔH) = ΔH1 + ΔH2\nΔH = 3.34 kJ + 1.045 kJ ≈ 4.39 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the fusion of 10 grams of ice at 0°C to liquid water at 25°C is approximately 4.39 kJ."
