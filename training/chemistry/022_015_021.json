    "message_1": "Sure! \n\nDuring a chemical reaction, one of the reactants is completely consumed, producing 10 grams of product. If the theoretical yield of the product was 12 grams and the actual yield was 10 grams, what is the percent yield of the reaction?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the percent yield of the reaction, you can use the following formula:\n\nPercent Yield = (Actual Yield / Theoretical Yield) x 100\n\nIn this case, the actual yield is 10 grams, and the theoretical yield is 12 grams. Plugging these values into the formula:\n\nPercent Yield = (10 / 12) x 100\n\nPercent Yield = 0.8333 x 100\n\nPercent Yield = 83.33%\n\nSo, the percent yield of the reaction is 83.33%."
