    "message_2": "For a reaction of first order with respect to both A and B, the rate law can be expressed as:\n\nrate = k[A]^1[B]^1\n\nwhere rate is the initial rate of reaction, k is the rate constant, and [A] and [B] are the initial concentrations of A and B, respectively.\n\nGiven the initial rate of reaction (0.1 M/s), the initial concentrations of A (0.2 M) and B (0.3 M), we can solve for the rate constant (k):\n\n0.1 M/s = k(0.2 M)(0.3 M)\n\nTo find the value of k, divide both sides of the equation by (0.2 M)(0.3 M):\n\nk = (0.1 M/s) / ((0.2 M)(0.3 M))\nk = 0.1 / 0.06\nk = 1.67 s^-1\n\nThe reaction rate constant (k) for the reaction A + B → C is 1.67 s^-1."
