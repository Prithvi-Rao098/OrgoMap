    "message_2": "The most efficient method for synthesizing 2,4-dinitrophenol from phenol and nitric acid with a high yield is through a two-step nitration process.\n\n1. First Nitration: In this step, phenol is nitrated to form 2-nitrophenol or 4-nitrophenol. To carry out this reaction, mix phenol with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4). The sulfuric acid acts as a catalyst and helps in controlling the reaction rate. The reaction should be carried out at a temperature between 0-5°C to avoid over-nitration. The molar ratio of phenol to nitric acid should be around 1:1.5 to ensure a high yield.\n\n2. Second Nitration: In this step, the mono-nitrophenol (either 2-nitrophenol or 4-nitrophenol) is further nitrated to form 2,4-dinitrophenol. To carry out this reaction, mix the mono-nitrophenol with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid. The reaction should be carried out at a temperature between 0-5°C to avoid over-nitration. The molar ratio of mono-nitrophenol to nitric acid should be around 1:1.5 to ensure a high yield.\n\nAfter the second nitration, the reaction mixture should be poured into cold water to precipitate the 2,4-dinitrophenol. The precipitate can be filtered, washed with water, and recrystallized from a suitable solvent (e.g., ethanol) to obtain pure 2,4-dinitrophenol.\n\nIt is important to note that 2,4-dinitrophenol is a hazardous substance and should be handled with care. Proper safety measures, including wearing gloves, goggles, and a lab coat, should be taken while performing this synthesis."
