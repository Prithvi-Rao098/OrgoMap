    "message_2": "When hydrochloric acid (HCl) is mixed with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), the following neutralization reaction occurs:\n\nHCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H2O(l)\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for this reaction, also known as the enthalpy of neutralization, is approximately -57.3 kJ/mol for strong acids and strong bases like HCl and NaOH.\n\nTo calculate the enthalpy change for the given reaction, we first need to determine the number of moles of HCl and NaOH in the solutions:\n\nMoles of HCl = (volume in L) × (concentration in mol/L) = (50 mL × 1 L/1000 mL) × 1 M = 0.05 mol\nMoles of NaOH = (volume in L) × (concentration in mol/L) = (50 mL × 1 L/1000 mL) × 1 M = 0.05 mol\n\nSince the moles of HCl and NaOH are equal, the reaction goes to completion, and all of the HCl and NaOH will react.\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nΔH = moles of HCl × enthalpy of neutralization = 0.05 mol × -57.3 kJ/mol = -2.865 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the reaction is approximately -2.865 kJ."
