    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat released when burning 5.00 grams of methane (CH4) in excess oxygen under standard conditions, we need to use the following equation:\n\nq = n × ΔH_combustion\n\nwhere q is the heat released, n is the number of moles of methane, and ΔH_combustion is the enthalpy of combustion for methane.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of methane (n). We can do this using the molar mass of methane:\n\nn = mass / molar mass\n\nThe molar mass of methane (CH4) is 12.01 g/mol (for carbon) + 4 × 1.01 g/mol (for hydrogen) = 16.04 g/mol.\n\nNow, we can find the number of moles of methane:\n\nn = 5.00 g / 16.04 g/mol = 0.3118 mol\n\nNext, we need the enthalpy of combustion for methane (ΔH_combustion). The standard enthalpy of combustion for methane is -890.4 kJ/mol.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the amount of heat released (q):\n\nq = 0.3118 mol × -890.4 kJ/mol = -277.6 kJ\n\nSo, the amount of heat released when burning 5.00 grams of methane in excess oxygen under standard conditions is approximately 277.6 kJ (released, so negative sign indicates exothermic reaction)."
