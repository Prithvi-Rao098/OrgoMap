    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the solidification of 50 grams of liquid water at 25 degrees Celsius, we need to consider three steps:\n\n1. Cooling the liquid water from 25°C to 0°C\n2. Solidifying the liquid water at 0°C\n3. Warming the ice from 0°C to -25°C (since the question asks for the enthalpy change at 25°C, we will assume it means -25°C)\n\nStep 1: Cooling the liquid water from 25°C to 0°C\nq1 = mcΔT\nwhere m is the mass of water, c is the molar heat capacity of liquid water, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of water:\nMolar mass of water (H2O) = 18.015 g/mol\n50 g / 18.015 g/mol = 2.775 moles\n\nq1 = (2.775 moles) * (75.3 J/mol K) * (0°C - 25°C)\nq1 = 2.775 * 75.3 * (-25)\nq1 = -5204.625 J\n\nStep 2: Solidifying the liquid water at 0°C\nq2 = nΔHf\nwhere n is the number of moles of water and ΔHf is the heat of fusion for water.\n\nq2 = (2.775 moles) * (6.01 kJ/mol)\nq2 = 16.67575 kJ\nq2 = 16675.75 J (converted to Joules)\n\nStep 3: Warming the ice from 0°C to -25°C\nq3 = mcΔT\nwhere m is the mass of ice, c is the molar heat capacity of ice, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nq3 = (2.775 moles) * (36.8 J/mol K) * (-25°C - 0°C)\nq3 = 2.775 * 36.8 * (-25)\nq3 = -2547.75 J\n\nNow, we can find the total enthalpy change by adding the enthalpy changes for each step:\nΔH_total = q1 + q2 + q3\nΔH_total = -5204.625 J + 16675.75 J - 2547.75 J\nΔH_total = 8923.375 J\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the solidification of 50 grams of liquid water at 25 degrees Celsius is 8923.375 J."
