    "message_2": "The effect of changing the pH on the equilibrium concentration of the complex ion Fe(CN)6 4- can be understood by examining the formation of the complex and the factors that influence its equilibrium. The complex ion Fe(CN)6 4- is formed by the reaction between Fe3+ and CN- ions:\n\nFe3+ + 6CN- <=> Fe(CN)6 4-\n\nTo predict the effect of pH on the equilibrium concentration of Fe(CN)6 4-, we need to consider the Le Chatelier's principle, which states that when a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in concentration, temperature, or pressure, the system will adjust itself to counteract the change and restore a new equilibrium.\n\nIn this case, the pH change will affect the concentration of CN- ions, which are derived from the dissociation of HCN:\n\nHCN <=> H+ + CN-\n\nWhen the pH decreases (more acidic conditions), the concentration of H+ ions increases. According to Le Chatelier's principle, the equilibrium of the HCN dissociation will shift to the left, decreasing the concentration of CN- ions. As a result, the equilibrium of the complex formation will also shift to the left, decreasing the concentration of Fe(CN)6 4- ions and increasing the concentration of Fe3+ ions.\n\nOn the other hand, when the pH increases (more basic conditions), the concentration of H+ ions decreases. This will shift the equilibrium of the HCN dissociation to the right, increasing the concentration of CN- ions. Consequently, the equilibrium of the complex formation will shift to the right, increasing the concentration of Fe(CN)6 4- ions and decreasing the concentration of Fe3+ ions.\n\nIn summary, the effect of changing the pH on the equilibrium concentration of the complex ion Fe(CN)6 4- depends on the direction of the pH change. A decrease in pH (more acidic conditions) will decrease the concentration of Fe(CN)6 4-, while an increase in pH (more basic conditions) will increase the concentration of Fe(CN)6 4-. This can be explained by the Le Chatelier's principle and the influence of pH on the concentration of CN- ions, which are involved in the formation of the complex ion."
