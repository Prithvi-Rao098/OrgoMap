    "message_2": "To find the enthalpy change for the reaction CuO(s) + H2(g) → Cu(s) + H2O(l), we can use the given information and Hess's Law. \n\nFirst, we need to find the enthalpy change for the reaction CuO(s) + H2(g) → Cu(s) + H2O(g) to CuO(s) + H2(g) → Cu(s) + H2O(l). This can be done by considering the enthalpy of vaporization of water.\n\nH2O(l) → H2O(g)      ΔH° = +40.7 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can use Hess's Law to find the enthalpy change for the desired reaction. We can write the overall reaction as a combination of the two given reactions and the enthalpy of vaporization of water:\n\nCuO(s) + H2(g) → Cu(s) + H2O(g)     ΔH° = +157.3 kJ/mol\nH2O(g) → H2O(l)                          ΔH° = -40.7 kJ/mol (reverse the reaction)\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nCuO(s) + H2(g) → Cu(s) + H2O(l)      ΔH° = ?\n\nNow, we can add the enthalpy changes for each reaction:\n\nΔH° = (+157.3 kJ/mol) + (-40.7 kJ/mol) = +116.6 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the enthalpy change for the reaction CuO(s) + H2(g) → Cu(s) + H2O(l) is +116.6 kJ/mol."
