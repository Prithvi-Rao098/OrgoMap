    "message_2": "The surface tension of water at room temperature (around 20-25°C) and atmospheric pressure is approximately 72 mN/m (millinewtons per meter).\n\nThe capillary rise method is a common technique used to experimentally measure the surface tension of a liquid. In this method, a small diameter tube (capillary) is immersed in the liquid, and the liquid rises in the tube due to the surface tension. The height of the liquid column in the tube is related to the surface tension of the liquid.\n\nHere's a step-by-step procedure for measuring surface tension using the capillary rise method:\n\n1. Choose a clean, uniform capillary tube with a small diameter (e.g., a few millimeters). The inner diameter of the tube should be known or measured accurately.\n\n2. Immerse the capillary tube vertically into the water, ensuring that the water is at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.\n\n3. Observe the rise of the water column in the capillary tube. The water will rise until the force due to surface tension is balanced by the weight of the liquid column.\n\n4. Measure the height (h) of the liquid column above the water's surface outside the tube.\n\n5. Determine the density (ρ) of the water at the given temperature. For water at room temperature, the density is approximately 1000 kg/m³.\n\n6. Measure the acceleration due to gravity (g), which is approximately 9.81 m/s².\n\n7. Calculate the surface tension (γ) using the Jurin's Law formula:\n\n   γ = (ρghr²) / 2\n\n   where r is the radius of the capillary tube.\n\nBy following these steps and using the capillary rise method, you can experimentally measure the surface tension of water at room temperature and atmospheric pressure."
