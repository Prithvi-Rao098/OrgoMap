    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change of formation for ethanoic acid, we need to use Hess's Law. We can use the given standard enthalpy of combustion data to create a series of reactions that will ultimately give us the desired reaction.\n\nFirst, let's write the combustion reactions for ethanol, ethanoic acid, and water:\n\n1) C2H5OH + 3O2 → 2CO2 + 3H2O  ΔH = -1367 kJ/mol\n2) CH3COOH + 2O2 → 2CO2 + 2H2O  ΔH = x (unknown)\n3) H2 + 1/2O2 → H2O  ΔH = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we need to manipulate these reactions to obtain the desired reaction:\n\n2C2H5OH + 2O2 → 2CH3COOH + 2H2O\n\nFirst, multiply reaction 3 by 2 to get 2 moles of water:\n\n3') 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O  ΔH = -571.6 kJ/mol\n\nNow, reverse reaction 1 and multiply it by 2:\n\n1') 4CO2 + 6H2O → 4C2H5OH + 6O2  ΔH = 2734 kJ/mol\n\nFinally, add reactions 1', 2, and 3' together:\n\n4CO2 + 6H2O → 4C2H5OH + 6O2  ΔH = 2734 kJ/mol\nCH3COOH + 2O2 → 2CO2 + 2H2O  ΔH = x (unknown)\n2H2 + O2 → 2H2O  ΔH = -571.6 kJ/mol\n---------------------------------------------\n2C2H5OH + 2O2 → 2CH3COOH + 2H2O  ΔH = x + 2162.4 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can solve for the unknown enthalpy change of formation for ethanoic acid (x):\n\nx + 2162.4 kJ/mol = 0\nx = -2162.4 kJ/mol\n\nHowever, this is the enthalpy change for the formation of 2 moles of ethanoic acid. To find the enthalpy change for the formation of 1 mole of ethanoic acid, we need to divide this value by 2:\n\nΔHf (CH3COOH) = -2162.4 kJ/mol / 2 = -1081.2 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change of formation for ethanoic acid is -1081.2 kJ/mol."
