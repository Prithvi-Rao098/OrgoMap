    "message_2": "To calculate the formal charge of sulfur (S) in the sulfate ion (SO4^(2-)), we can use the following formula:\n\nFormal charge = (Valence electrons of the atom) - (Non-bonding electrons) - (1/2 x Bonding electrons)\n\nSulfur is in group 16 of the periodic table and has 6 valence electrons. In the sulfate ion, sulfur is bonded to four oxygen atoms through double bonds, which means there are 8 bonding electrons (4 bonds x 2 electrons per bond). Sulfur has no non-bonding electrons in this case.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nFormal charge of S = (6) - (0) - (1/2 x 8)\nFormal charge of S = 6 - 4\nFormal charge of S = +2\n\nSo, the formal charge of sulfur (S) in the sulfate ion (SO4^(2-)) is +2."
