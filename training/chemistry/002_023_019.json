    "message_2": "The conductivity of an inorganic compound is directly related to the concentration of ions present in the solution. When the concentration of an inorganic compound increases, the number of ions in the solution also increases. This leads to an increase in the conductivity of the solution.\n\nIn general, the conductivity of a solution (κ) is given by the equation:\n\nκ = C × Λ\n\nwhere C is the concentration of the solution (in mol/L) and Λ is the equivalent conductivity (in S cm²/mol), which is a measure of the ability of the ions to conduct electricity.\n\nAs the concentration of the inorganic compound increases, the number of ions in the solution increases, leading to an increase in the value of C. This, in turn, increases the conductivity of the solution (κ).\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the relationship between concentration and conductivity is not always linear, especially at higher concentrations. At higher concentrations, the ions in the solution can interact with each other, leading to a decrease in their mobility and a decrease in the equivalent conductivity (Λ). This can result in a non-linear relationship between concentration and conductivity.\n\nIn summary, increasing the concentration of an inorganic compound generally leads to an increase in the conductivity of the solution due to the increased number of ions present. However, the relationship between concentration and conductivity can be non-linear, especially at higher concentrations, due to ion interactions and decreased ion mobility."
