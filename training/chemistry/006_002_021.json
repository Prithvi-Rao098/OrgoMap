    "message_2": "To find the rate constant (k) of the polymerization reaction, we can use the half-life equation for a first-order reaction:\n\nt1/2 = 0.693 / k\n\nwhere t1/2 is the half-life of the reaction.\n\nGiven the half-life (t1/2) is 4.5 minutes, we can rearrange the equation to solve for k:\n\nk = 0.693 / t1/2\n\nk = 0.693 / 4.5 min\n\nk ≈ 0.154 min⁻¹\n\nSo, the rate constant of the polymerization reaction of styrene monomer at 60°C is approximately 0.154 min⁻¹."
