    "message_2": "To calculate the change in the equilibrium constant (K) for the formation of a complex ion when the temperature is increased from 25°C to 50°C, we can use the van't Hoff equation:\n\nln(K2/K1) = -ΔH/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere:\n- K1 and K2 are the equilibrium constants at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively\n- ΔH is the enthalpy change of the reaction (in J/mol)\n- R is the gas constant (8.314 J/(mol·K))\n- T1 and T2 are the initial and final temperatures in Kelvin (K)\n\nFirst, convert the temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin:\nT1 = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\nT2 = 50°C + 273.15 = 323.15 K\n\nNext, convert the enthalpy change from kJ/mol to J/mol:\nΔH = -20 kJ/mol * 1000 J/kJ = -20000 J/mol\n\nNow, plug the values into the van't Hoff equation:\nln(K2/K1) = -(-20000 J/mol) / (8.314 J/(mol·K)) * (1/323.15 K - 1/298.15 K)\n\nln(K2/K1) ≈ 10.12\n\nTo find the change in the equilibrium constant, we need to find the ratio K2/K1:\nK2/K1 = e^(10.12) ≈ 24800\n\nSince we are looking for the change in the equilibrium constant, we can say that the equilibrium constant has increased by a factor of approximately 24800 when the temperature is increased from 25°C to 50°C."
