    "message_1": "What is the standard enthalpy change for the sublimation of iodine? Given that the standard enthalpy of fusion for iodine is 15.52 kJ/mol, and the standard enthalpy of vaporization for iodine is 41.57 kJ/mol.",
    "message_2": "The standard enthalpy change for the sublimation of iodine can be calculated by adding the standard enthalpy of fusion and the standard enthalpy of vaporization. This is because sublimation is the process of a solid directly converting into a gas, which involves both fusion (solid to liquid) and vaporization (liquid to gas).\n\nStandard enthalpy change for sublimation = Standard enthalpy of fusion + Standard enthalpy of vaporization\n\nStandard enthalpy change for sublimation = 15.52 kJ/mol + 41.57 kJ/mol\n\nStandard enthalpy change for sublimation = 57.09 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the sublimation of iodine is 57.09 kJ/mol."
