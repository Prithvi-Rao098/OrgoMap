    "message_1": "What is the heat of hydration of magnesium sulfate (MgSO4)? Given that 100 g of MgSO4 is dissolved in water, and the temperature of the solution increases by 25 °C. The molar mass of MgSO4 is 120.36 g/mol and the specific heat capacity of water is 4.18 J/(g·°C). Express the heat of hydration in kJ/mol.",
    "message_2": "To find the heat of hydration of magnesium sulfate, we first need to determine the amount of heat released when 100 g of MgSO4 is dissolved in water. We can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat released, m is the mass of the substance, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nIn this case, the mass (m) is 100 g, the specific heat capacity (c) is 4.18 J/(g·°C), and the change in temperature (ΔT) is 25 °C. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nq = (100 g)(4.18 J/(g·°C))(25 °C) = 10450 J\n\nNow, we need to convert this value to kJ and find the heat of hydration per mole of MgSO4. First, convert the heat released to kJ:\n\n10450 J * (1 kJ / 1000 J) = 10.45 kJ\n\nNext, determine the number of moles of MgSO4 in 100 g:\n\nmoles = mass / molar mass = 100 g / 120.36 g/mol ≈ 0.831 mol\n\nFinally, divide the heat released by the number of moles to find the heat of hydration:\n\nheat of hydration = 10.45 kJ / 0.831 mol ≈ 12.57 kJ/mol\n\nThe heat of hydration of magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) is approximately 12.57 kJ/mol."
