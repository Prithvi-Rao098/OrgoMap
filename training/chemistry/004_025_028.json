Use voltammetry to determine the amount of copper ions present in the sample and calculate the concentration in parts per million (ppm).\n\nNote: The student should be familiar with the principles of voltammetry and know how to prepare and analyze samples for this technique.",
    "message_2": "To determine the concentration of copper ions (Cu2+) in a sample of industrial wastewater using voltammetry, follow these steps:\n\n1. Sample preparation: Collect a representative sample of the industrial wastewater. Filter the sample to remove any suspended solids or debris that may interfere with the voltammetric analysis.\n\n2. Calibration: Prepare a series of standard solutions containing known concentrations of copper ions (e.g., 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 ppm). Perform voltammetric measurements on each standard solution to generate a calibration curve. This curve will be used to determine the concentration of copper ions in the wastewater sample.\n\n3. Voltammetric analysis: Perform voltammetric measurements on the wastewater sample using the same method and settings as for the calibration standards. Record the peak current (Ip) corresponding to the reduction of Cu2+ ions.\n\n4. Data analysis: Use the calibration curve to determine the concentration of copper ions in the wastewater sample. Find the Ip value of the sample on the y-axis of the calibration curve, and read the corresponding concentration on the x-axis. This is the concentration of Cu2+ ions in the sample in ppm.\n\n5. Quality control: To ensure the accuracy of the results, analyze a quality control sample with a known concentration of copper ions. The measured concentration should be within an acceptable range of the true value.\n\n6. Report the results: Report the concentration of copper ions in the wastewater sample in parts per million (ppm)."
