    "message_2": "The reaction between propene (CH3-CH=CH2) and hydrogen bromide (HBr) to form 2-bromopropane (CH3-CHBr-CH3) is an electrophilic addition reaction. The mechanism of this reaction involves two main steps:\n\nStep 1: Formation of carbocation intermediate\nThe alkene (propene) acts as a nucleophile, and the hydrogen bromide acts as an electrophile. The double bond of the propene attacks the hydrogen atom of HBr, breaking the H-Br bond. The electrons from the H-Br bond move to the bromine atom, forming a bromide ion (Br-). This results in the formation of a carbocation intermediate, which is a positively charged carbon atom. In this case, it is a secondary carbocation (CH3-CH+-CH3).\n\nStep 2: Nucleophilic attack by bromide ion\nThe bromide ion (Br-) formed in the first step now acts as a nucleophile and attacks the positively charged carbon atom in the carbocation intermediate. This results in the formation of the final product, 2-bromopropane (CH3-CHBr-CH3).\n\nOverall, the mechanism of the reaction between propene and hydrogen bromide to form 2-bromopropane involves electrophilic addition, with the formation of a carbocation intermediate and a nucleophilic attack by the bromide ion."
