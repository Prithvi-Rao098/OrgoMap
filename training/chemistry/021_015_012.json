    "message_2": "The molecular geometry of the CO2 molecule is linear. This geometry results from the bonding between the carbon and oxygen atoms, which involves the formation of two double bonds between the central carbon atom and the two oxygen atoms.\n\nIn CO2, the central carbon atom has four valence electrons, and each oxygen atom has six valence electrons. The carbon atom forms two double bonds with the two oxygen atoms, sharing two electrons with each oxygen atom. This results in a total of eight electrons around the carbon atom, satisfying the octet rule.\n\nThe electron pairs in the double bonds repel each other, causing them to be as far apart as possible. In this case, the two double bonds are arranged 180 degrees apart from each other, resulting in a linear molecular geometry. This linear arrangement minimizes the repulsion between the electron pairs and provides the most stable configuration for the CO2 molecule."
