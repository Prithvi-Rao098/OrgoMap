    "message_2": "To prepare phenylalanine from benzyl chloride and ammonia, you can follow the following steps:\n\n1. Formation of benzylamine:\nReagents: Benzyl chloride (C6H5CH2Cl) and excess ammonia (NH3)\nConditions: Room temperature, aqueous solution\nMechanism: Nucleophilic substitution (S_N2) reaction\n\nIn this step, benzyl chloride reacts with ammonia in a nucleophilic substitution reaction. The nitrogen atom in ammonia acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon atom in benzyl chloride, leading to the displacement of the chloride ion. The product formed is benzylamine (C6H5CH2NH2).\n\nC6H5CH2Cl + 2NH3 → C6H5CH2NH2 + NH4Cl\n\n2. Formation of phenylalanine via Strecker synthesis:\nReagents: Benzylamine (C6H5CH2NH2), acetaldehyde (CH3CHO), and hydrogen cyanide (HCN)\nConditions: Room temperature, aqueous solution\nMechanism: Strecker synthesis\n\nIn this step, benzylamine reacts with acetaldehyde in the presence of hydrogen cyanide to form an α-aminonitrile intermediate, which is then hydrolyzed to form phenylalanine.\n\na) Formation of imine:\nBenzylamine reacts with acetaldehyde to form an imine intermediate.\nC6H5CH2NH2 + CH3CHO → C6H5CH2N=CHCH3 + H2O\n\nb) Nucleophilic addition of HCN:\nThe imine reacts with HCN to form an α-aminonitrile intermediate.\nC6H5CH2N=CHCH3 + HCN → C6H5CH2NHCH(CN)CH3\n\nc) Hydrolysis of α-aminonitrile:\nThe α-aminonitrile intermediate is hydrolyzed under acidic conditions to form phenylalanine.\nC6H5CH2NHCH(CN)CH3 + 2H2O → C6H5CH2NHCH(COOH)CH3 + NH3\n\nOverall reaction:\nC6H5CH2NH2 + CH3CHO + HCN → C6H5CH2NHCH(COOH)CH3\n\nIn summary, to prepare phenylalanine from benzyl chloride and ammonia, you need to first form benzylamine through a nucleophilic substitution reaction. Then, perform a Strecker synthesis using benzylamine, acetaldehyde, and hydrogen cyanide to obtain phenylalanine."
