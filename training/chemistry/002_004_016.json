    "message_2": "To find the pH of the solution, we first need to determine the moles of H+ from hydrochloric acid (HCl) and the moles of OH- from sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and then find the resulting moles of each ion after the reaction.\n\n1. Calculate the moles of H+ from HCl:\nmoles of H+ = volume (L) × concentration (M)\nmoles of H+ = 0.050 L × 0.1 M = 0.005 moles\n\n2. Calculate the moles of OH- from NaOH:\nmoles of OH- = volume (L) × concentration (M)\nmoles of OH- = 0.100 L × 0.2 M = 0.020 moles\n\n3. Determine the resulting moles of each ion after the reaction:\nHCl and NaOH react in a 1:1 ratio, so the limiting reactant is HCl.\nmoles of OH- remaining = 0.020 moles - 0.005 moles = 0.015 moles\n\n4. Calculate the concentration of OH- in the final solution:\nThe total volume of the solution is 50 mL + 100 mL = 150 mL (0.150 L).\nconcentration of OH- = moles of OH- / total volume (L)\nconcentration of OH- = 0.015 moles / 0.150 L = 0.1 M\n\n5. Calculate the pOH of the solution:\npOH = -log10(concentration of OH-)\npOH = -log10(0.1) = 1\n\n6. Calculate the pH of the solution:\npH + pOH = 14\npH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1 = 13\n\nThe pH of the solution made by mixing 50 mL of 0.1 M hydrochloric acid with 100 mL of 0.2 M sodium hydroxide is 13."
