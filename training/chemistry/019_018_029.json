    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the phase transition of ice to water at 298 K, we need to consider two steps: \n\n1. Heating the ice from its initial temperature (assumed to be 273 K, the melting point of ice) to the melting point.\n2. Melting the ice at the melting point (273 K) to form water.\n\nStep 1: Heating the ice from 273 K to 298 K\nΔH1 = molar heat capacity of ice * ΔT\nΔH1 = 37.0 J/(mol*K) * (298 K - 273 K)\nΔH1 = 37.0 J/(mol*K) * 25 K\nΔH1 = 925 J/mol\n\nStep 2: Melting the ice at 273 K\nΔH2 = heat of fusion of ice\nΔH2 = 6.01 kJ/mol\nΔH2 = 6010 J/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the total enthalpy change for the phase transition of ice to water at 298 K by adding the enthalpy changes for both steps:\n\nΔH_total = ΔH1 + ΔH2\nΔH_total = 925 J/mol + 6010 J/mol\nΔH_total = 6935 J/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the phase transition of ice to water at 298 K is 6935 J/mol."
