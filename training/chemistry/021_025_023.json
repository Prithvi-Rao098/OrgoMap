    "message_2": "The type of bonding present in Sodium Chloride (NaCl) is ionic bonding. This occurs when a metal (Sodium, Na) transfers one or more electrons to a non-metal (Chlorine, Cl) to form positively charged cations (Na+) and negatively charged anions (Cl-). These ions are then attracted to each other due to the electrostatic forces between them, forming an ionic compound."
