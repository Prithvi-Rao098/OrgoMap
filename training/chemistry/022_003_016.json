    "message_2": "To find the net ionic equation for the reaction of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH), we first need to write the balanced molecular equation:\n\nHCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H2O(l)\n\nNext, we write the total ionic equation by breaking down all the soluble ionic compounds into their respective ions:\n\nH+(aq) + Cl^-(aq) + Na+(aq) + OH^-(aq) → Na+(aq) + Cl^-(aq) + H2O(l)\n\nNow, we can identify and remove the spectator ions, which are the ions that do not participate in the reaction. In this case, Na+(aq) and Cl^-(aq) are the spectator ions.\n\nH+(aq) + OH^-(aq) → H2O(l)\n\nThe net ionic equation for the reaction of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is:\n\nH+(aq) + OH^-(aq) → H2O(l)"
