    "message_2": "To calculate the theoretical yield of aspirin, we first need to determine the limiting reactant. The balanced chemical equation for the synthesis of aspirin is:\n\nC7H6O3 (salicylic acid) + C4H6O3 (acetic anhydride) → C9H8O4 (aspirin) + C2H4O2 (acetic acid)\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of each reactant:\n\n1. Salicylic acid: \nMolar mass = 138.12 g/mol\nMoles = mass / molar mass = 2.0 g / 138.12 g/mol = 0.0145 mol\n\n2. Acetic anhydride:\nDensity = 1.08 g/mL\nMass = volume × density = 5.0 mL × 1.08 g/mL = 5.4 g\nMolar mass = 102.09 g/mol\nMoles = mass / molar mass = 5.4 g / 102.09 g/mol = 0.0529 mol\n\nNow, we need to determine the limiting reactant by comparing the mole ratio:\n\nMole ratio of salicylic acid to acetic anhydride = 0.0145 mol / 0.0529 mol = 0.274\n\nSince the mole ratio is less than 1, salicylic acid is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow, we can calculate the theoretical yield of aspirin:\n\nMoles of aspirin = moles of salicylic acid (since the mole ratio is 1:1) = 0.0145 mol\nMolar mass of aspirin = 180.16 g/mol\nTheoretical yield = moles × molar mass = 0.0145 mol × 180.16 g/mol = 2.61 g\n\nSo, the theoretical yield of aspirin that can be produced from this mixture is 2.61 grams."
