    "message_2": "To determine the chemical structure of an unknown organic compound, various spectroscopic techniques can be employed. These techniques provide information about the functional groups, connectivity, and overall structure of the molecule. Some common spectroscopic methods used in organic chemistry include:\n\n1. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy: This technique measures the absorption of infrared radiation by the compound, which causes molecular vibrations. The resulting spectrum can be used to identify specific functional groups present in the molecule.\n\n2. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy: NMR spectroscopy exploits the magnetic properties of certain atomic nuclei, such as 1H and 13C. The technique provides information about the number and types of atoms, their connectivity, and the chemical environment around them. Two common types of NMR spectroscopy are proton (1H) NMR and carbon (13C) NMR.\n\n3. Mass Spectrometry (MS): This technique involves ionizing the compound and measuring the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of the resulting ions. The mass spectrum can provide information about the molecular weight of the compound, as well as the presence of specific functional groups and structural fragments.\n\n4. Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) Spectroscopy: This technique measures the absorption of ultraviolet and visible light by the compound. The resulting spectrum can provide information about the presence of conjugated systems and chromophores in the molecule.\n\nTo determine the chemical structure of an unknown organic compound, a chemist would typically use a combination of these spectroscopic techniques. The data obtained from each method can be combined and analyzed to deduce the structure of the compound. For example, IR spectroscopy can be used to identify functional groups, NMR spectroscopy can provide information about the connectivity of atoms and the chemical environment, and mass spectrometry can help confirm the molecular weight and the presence of specific fragments. By integrating the information from all these techniques, a chemist can piece together the chemical structure of the unknown compound."
