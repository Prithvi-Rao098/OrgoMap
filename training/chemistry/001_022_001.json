    "message_2": "The major product formed in the acid-catalyzed rearrangement reaction of 2-methyl-1,5-hexadiene is 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process of the reaction:\n\n1. Protonation of the alkene: The acid catalyst donates a proton (H+) to the alkene, forming a carbocation on the more substituted carbon (Markovnikov's rule). In this case, the carbocation is formed at the tertiary carbon (C3) adjacent to the methyl group.\n\n2. 1,2-hydride shift: A hydride (H-) from the adjacent carbon (C2) shifts to the carbocation, forming a more stable secondary carbocation at C2.\n\n3. Deprotonation: A base (usually the conjugate base of the acid catalyst) abstracts a proton from the carbocation, forming the double bond and yielding the final product, 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene."
