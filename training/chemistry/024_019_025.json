    "message_2": "To optimize the formula and process parameters for the production of an environmentally-friendly detergent with high cleaning efficiency, we need to consider the following factors:\n\n1. Selection of surfactants: Choose biodegradable surfactants that have low toxicity and high cleaning efficiency. Examples include alkyl polyglucosides (APGs), fatty alcohol ethoxylates (FAEs), and sulfonated methyl esters (SMEs). These surfactants are derived from renewable resources and have a lower environmental impact compared to traditional surfactants like alkylbenzene sulfonates (ABS) and linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS).\n\n2. Enzymes: Incorporate enzymes such as proteases, lipases, amylases, and cellulases to enhance the cleaning efficiency of the detergent. Enzymes are biodegradable and can break down various types of stains, reducing the need for high concentrations of surfactants and other additives.\n\n3. Builders: Use environmentally-friendly builders like citrates, gluconates, and zeolites to replace phosphates, which can cause eutrophication in water bodies. Builders help to soften water, enhance the cleaning efficiency of surfactants, and prevent soil redeposition.\n\n4. Bleaching agents: Opt for oxygen-based bleaching agents like hydrogen peroxide and sodium percarbonate instead of chlorine-based bleaching agents, which can produce toxic by-products. Oxygen-based bleaching agents are effective at lower temperatures, reducing energy consumption.\n\n5. Other additives: Incorporate biodegradable additives like chelating agents (e.g., ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) alternatives), defoamers, and optical brighteners that have a low environmental impact.\n\n6. Concentration: Develop a concentrated detergent formula to reduce packaging, transportation, and storage costs. This also reduces the amount of water required during the production process, minimizing energy consumption and waste generation.\n\n7. Production process: Optimize the production process by implementing energy-efficient equipment, recycling water, and minimizing waste generation. Utilize renewable energy sources like solar and wind power to reduce the carbon footprint of the production process.\n\n8. Quality control: Establish strict quality control measures to ensure the consistency and effectiveness of the detergent. Regularly monitor the performance of the detergent in terms of cleaning efficiency, biodegradability, and environmental impact.\n\n9. Consumer education: Educate consumers on the proper use of the detergent, including dosage and washing temperature, to maximize cleaning efficiency and minimize environmental impact.\n\nBy considering these factors, you can optimize the formula and process parameters for the production of an environmentally-friendly detergent with high cleaning efficiency, while minimizing energy consumption, waste generation, and production costs."
