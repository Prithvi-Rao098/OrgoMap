    "message_2": "When propene (CH2=CHCH3) reacts with HBr in the presence of peroxide as a catalyst, the reaction follows a free radical mechanism, which is also known as an anti-Markovnikov addition. In this case, the bromine atom (Br) will attach to the less substituted carbon of the double bond, and the hydrogen atom (H) will attach to the more substituted carbon. The product formed in this reaction is 1-bromopropane (CH3CH2CH2Br)."
