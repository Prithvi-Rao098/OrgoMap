    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change of the polymerization reaction of ethylene, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH_polymerization = ΔH_combustion - ΔH_released\n\nwhere ΔH_polymerization is the enthalpy change of the polymerization reaction, ΔH_combustion is the enthalpy of combustion of ethylene, and ΔH_released is the energy released during the polymerization process.\n\nGiven that the enthalpy of combustion of ethylene is -1411.1 kJ/mol and the polymerization of ethylene releases 3.4 kJ/mol, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔH_polymerization = (-1411.1 kJ/mol) - (3.4 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH_polymerization = -1414.5 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy change of the polymerization reaction of ethylene is -1414.5 kJ/mol."
