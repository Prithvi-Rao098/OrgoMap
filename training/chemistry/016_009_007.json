    "message_2": "To find the enthalpy of vaporization of ethanol at 68°C, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates the vapor pressure of a substance at different temperatures to its enthalpy of vaporization. The equation is:\n\nln(P1/P2) = (ΔHvap/R) * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nWhere P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization, and R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K).\n\nFirst, we need to find the vapor pressure of ethanol at its normal boiling point (78.24°C). At the normal boiling point, the vapor pressure is equal to 1 atm (101.3 kPa).\n\nNow, we need to find the vapor pressure of ethanol at 68°C. We can use the Antoine equation to estimate this value:\n\nlog10(P) = A - (B / (T + C))\n\nFor ethanol, the Antoine constants are A = 8.20417, B = 1642.89, and C = 230.3. The temperature T should be in Celsius.\n\nlog10(P) = 8.20417 - (1642.89 / (68 + 230.3))\nP = 10^(2.718)\nP ≈ 52.5 kPa\n\nNow we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to find the enthalpy of vaporization at 68°C:\n\nln(52.5/101.3) = (ΔHvap/8.314) * (1/(68+273.15) - 1/(78.24+273.15))\nΔHvap = 8.314 * (ln(52.5/101.3) / (1/(68+273.15) - 1/(78.24+273.15)))\n\nΔHvap ≈ 38,800 J/mol or 38.8 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the enthalpy of vaporization of ethanol at 68°C is approximately 38.8 kJ/mol."
