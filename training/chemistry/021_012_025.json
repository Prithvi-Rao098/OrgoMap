    "message_2": "Bond dissociation energy (BDE) is the energy required to break a chemical bond homolytically, i.e., to separate the bonded atoms into individual atoms with one electron each. It is an important parameter to evaluate the bond strength of a molecule.\n\nFor methane (CH4), there are four C-H bonds. The average bond dissociation energy for a C-H bond in methane is approximately 439 kJ/mol. Since there are four such bonds, the total bond dissociation energy for methane is approximately 4 x 439 kJ/mol = 1756 kJ/mol.\n\nFor carbon monoxide (CO), there is one C≡O triple bond. The bond dissociation energy for the C≡O bond in CO is approximately 1072 kJ/mol.\n\nFor ammonia (NH3), there are three N-H bonds. The average bond dissociation energy for an N-H bond in ammonia is approximately 391 kJ/mol. Since there are three such bonds, the total bond dissociation energy for ammonia is approximately 3 x 391 kJ/mol = 1173 kJ/mol.\n\nComparing the bond strengths using bond dissociation energies:\n\nMethane (CH4) has a total bond dissociation energy of 1756 kJ/mol, which is higher than that of carbon monoxide (CO) at 1072 kJ/mol and ammonia (NH3) at 1173 kJ/mol. This indicates that the C-H bonds in methane are relatively strong compared to the C≡O bond in CO and the N-H bonds in NH3. However, it is important to note that this comparison is for the total bond dissociation energy of the molecules, not the individual bond strengths. The C≡O triple bond in CO is stronger than a single C-H bond in methane or an N-H bond in ammonia, but methane and ammonia have more bonds contributing to their total bond dissociation energies."
