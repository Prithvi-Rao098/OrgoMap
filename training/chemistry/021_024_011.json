    "message_2": "Using molecular orbital theory, we can determine the bond order of an O2 molecule by considering the electron configuration of oxygen and the molecular orbitals formed when two oxygen atoms combine.\n\nOxygen has 8 electrons, so an O2 molecule has a total of 16 electrons. These electrons will fill the molecular orbitals in the following order: σ1s, σ*1s, σ2s, σ*2s, π2px, π2py, σ2pz, π*2px, π*2py, and σ*2pz.\n\nThe electron configuration of O2 is:\n\nσ1s^2, σ*1s^2, σ2s^2, σ*2s^2, π2px^2, π2py^2, σ2pz^2, π*2px^1, π*2py^1\n\nNow, we can calculate the bond order using the formula:\n\nBond order = (number of electrons in bonding orbitals - number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\n\nBond order = (8 - 4) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2\n\nSo, the bond order of O2 is 2.\n\nRegarding the magnetic property of the O2 molecule, we can see that there are two unpaired electrons in the π*2px and π*2py orbitals. The presence of unpaired electrons makes the molecule paramagnetic, which means it will be attracted to an external magnetic field."
