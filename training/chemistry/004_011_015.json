    "message_2": "As an AI language model, I cannot directly analyze NMR spectra or any other graphical data. However, if you provide me with the relevant information from the NMR spectra, such as chemical shifts, multiplicities, and integration values, I can help you interpret the data and determine the chemical structure of compound X."
