    "message_2": "To determine the maximum yield of p-nitroaniline, we need to first find the limiting reagent in the reaction. We will do this by calculating the moles of each reactant and comparing their mole ratios.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nC6H7N + HNO3 → C6H6N2O2 + H2O\n\nMolar mass of aniline (C6H7N) = (6 × 12.01) + (7 × 1.01) + (1 × 14.01) = 93.13 g/mol\nMolar mass of nitric acid (HNO3) = (1 × 1.01) + (1 × 14.01) + (3 × 16.00) = 63.02 g/mol\nMolar mass of p-nitroaniline (C6H6N2O2) = (6 × 12.01) + (6 × 1.01) + (2 × 14.01) + (2 × 16.00) = 138.12 g/mol\n\nNow, let's calculate the moles of each reactant:\n\nMoles of aniline = mass / molar mass = 10 g / 93.13 g/mol = 0.107 mol\nMoles of nitric acid = (volume × concentration) / molar mass = (20 mL × 0.7 g/mL) / 63.02 g/mol = 0.222 mol\n\nNow, let's compare the mole ratios:\n\nMole ratio of aniline to nitric acid = 0.107 mol / 0.222 mol = 0.482\n\nSince the mole ratio is less than 1, aniline is the limiting reagent.\n\nNow, we can calculate the maximum yield of p-nitroaniline:\n\nMoles of p-nitroaniline = moles of aniline (limiting reagent) = 0.107 mol\nMass of p-nitroaniline = moles × molar mass = 0.107 mol × 138.12 g/mol = 14.78 g\n\nTherefore, the maximum yield of p-nitroaniline that can be obtained is 14.78 grams."
