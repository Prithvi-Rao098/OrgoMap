    "message_1": "Consider the following chemical equation: \n\n2 SO2(g) + O2(g) â‡Œ 2 SO3(g)\n\nAt equilibrium, the concentration of SO2 was found to be 0.10 M, the concentration of O2 was found to be 0.20 M, and the concentration of SO3 was found to be 0.30 M. What is the value of the equilibrium constant (Kc) for this reaction at the given temperature?",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction, we can use the expression:\n\nKc = [SO3]^2 / ([SO2]^2 * [O2])\n\nGiven the equilibrium concentrations:\n[SO2] = 0.10 M\n[O2] = 0.20 M\n[SO3] = 0.30 M\n\nPlug these values into the Kc expression:\n\nKc = (0.30)^2 / ((0.10)^2 * (0.20))\n\nKc = 0.09 / (0.01 * 0.20)\n\nKc = 0.09 / 0.002\n\nKc = 45\n\nSo, the value of the equilibrium constant (Kc) for this reaction at the given temperature is 45."
