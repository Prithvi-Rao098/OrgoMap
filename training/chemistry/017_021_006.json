    "message_2": "Chiral molecules that exhibit different photochemical properties for the two enantiomers are called photoresponsive chiral compounds. Some examples of these compounds include:\n\n1. Azobenzene derivatives: Azobenzene derivatives are known for their photoisomerization properties, where they can switch between cis and trans isomers upon exposure to light. Chiral azobenzene derivatives can exhibit different photochemical properties for their enantiomers, making them useful in various applications such as chiral switches and molecular machines.\n\n2. Spiropyran derivatives: Spiropyrans are another class of photochromic compounds that can undergo reversible isomerization upon exposure to light. Chiral spiropyrans can have different photochemical properties for their enantiomers, which can be utilized in the development of chiral sensors and optical devices.\n\n3. Binaphthyl derivatives: Binaphthyl derivatives are known for their atropisomerism, where the two enantiomers can have different photochemical properties. These compounds have been used in asymmetric catalysis and chiral recognition.\n\nPossible applications of these photoresponsive chiral compounds in photochemistry include:\n\n1. Chiral switches: Photoresponsive chiral compounds can be used as chiral switches, where the enantiomers can be selectively converted upon exposure to light. This can be useful in the development of smart materials and molecular machines.\n\n2. Chiral sensors: Chiral sensors can be developed using photoresponsive chiral compounds, where the different photochemical properties of the enantiomers can be used to detect and differentiate between chiral analytes.\n\n3. Asymmetric catalysis: Photoresponsive chiral compounds can be used as catalysts in asymmetric reactions, where the different photochemical properties of the enantiomers can be exploited to control the stereochemistry of the reaction products.\n\n4. Chiral recognition: Chiral recognition can be achieved using photoresponsive chiral compounds, where the different photochemical properties of the enantiomers can be used to selectively bind and differentiate between chiral analytes.\n\n5. Optical devices: Photoresponsive chiral compounds can be used in the development of optical devices, such as chiral liquid crystals and chiroptical switches, where the different photochemical properties of the enantiomers can be used to control the optical properties of the device."
