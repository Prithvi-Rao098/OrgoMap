    "message_2": "To optimize the structure and properties of a small molecule for the treatment of hypertension, several factors need to be considered. These factors include potency, selectivity, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity. Here are some strategies to improve these factors:\n\n1. Potency: Enhance the molecule's ability to bind its target, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or calcium channel blockers. This can be achieved by modifying the functional groups or the overall structure of the molecule to improve its binding affinity.\n\n2. Selectivity: Improve the molecule's selectivity for its target to minimize off-target effects and reduce potential side effects. This can be done by studying the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of the molecule and its analogs, and modifying the molecule to enhance its specificity for the desired target.\n\n3. Pharmacokinetics: Optimize the molecule's absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties to ensure it reaches the target site in the body at the appropriate concentration and duration. This can involve modifying the molecule's lipophilicity, molecular weight, or polar surface area to improve its solubility, permeability, and stability.\n\n4. Toxicity: Minimize the molecule's potential to cause adverse effects by evaluating its toxicity profile and modifying its structure to reduce or eliminate toxic metabolites or reactive intermediates. This can involve incorporating functional groups that are less prone to metabolic activation or using prodrugs that are converted to the active form in the body.\n\n5. Drug-drug interactions: Evaluate the potential for the molecule to interact with other medications commonly used in hypertensive patients, such as diuretics, beta-blockers, or other antihypertensive agents. Modify the molecule to minimize these interactions and reduce the risk of adverse effects or reduced efficacy.\n\n6. Formulation: Develop a suitable formulation for the molecule that ensures optimal bioavailability, stability, and patient compliance. This may involve selecting the appropriate salt form, solubilizing agents, or controlled-release systems.\n\n7. Preclinical and clinical testing: Conduct thorough preclinical and clinical studies to evaluate the molecule's safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics in relevant animal models and human subjects. Use the data obtained from these studies to further optimize the molecule and its formulation.\n\nBy considering these factors and employing a rational drug design approach, the structure and properties of a small molecule can be optimized to improve its efficacy and safety as a treatment for hypertension."
