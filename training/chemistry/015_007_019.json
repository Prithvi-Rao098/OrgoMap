    "message_2": "The lowest energy transition of a molecule with a HOMO-LUMO gap of 3 eV corresponds to the energy required to excite an electron from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). To find the corresponding wavelength of this transition, we can use the equation:\n\nE = h * c / λ\n\nwhere E is the energy (in joules), h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), c is the speed of light (3.00 x 10^8 m/s), and λ is the wavelength (in meters).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the energy from electron volts (eV) to joules (J). The conversion factor is 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J. So, 3 eV = 3 * 1.602 x 10^-19 J = 4.806 x 10^-19 J.\n\nNow, we can solve for the wavelength:\n\nλ = h * c / E\nλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (3.00 x 10^8 m/s) / (4.806 x 10^-19 J)\nλ = 4.135 x 10^-7 m\n\nTo express the wavelength in nanometers (nm), we can convert meters to nanometers by multiplying by 10^9:\n\nλ = 4.135 x 10^-7 m * 10^9 nm/m = 413.5 nm\n\nSo, the lowest energy transition of a molecule with a HOMO-LUMO gap of 3 eV corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 413.5 nm."
