    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Ka) for the ionization of acetic acid in water at 25°C, we first need to find the concentration of hydrogen ions [H+] using the given pH value.\n\npH = -log[H+]\n\n4.50 = -log[H+]\n\nNow, we need to find the concentration of hydrogen ions:\n\n[H+] = 10^(-pH)\n[H+] = 10^(-4.50)\n[H+] = 3.16 × 10^(-5) M\n\nThe ionization of acetic acid (CH3COOH) in water can be represented by the following equilibrium equation:\n\nCH3COOH ⇌ CH3COO- + H+\n\nSince the initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.10 M and it loses [H+] = 3.16 × 10^(-5) M, the equilibrium concentrations will be:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.10 - 3.16 × 10^(-5) M\n[CH3COO-] = [H+] = 3.16 × 10^(-5) M\n\nNow we can find the equilibrium constant (Ka) using the equilibrium concentrations:\n\nKa = ([CH3COO-] × [H+]) / [CH3COOH]\nKa = (3.16 × 10^(-5) × 3.16 × 10^(-5)) / (0.10 - 3.16 × 10^(-5))\nKa = 1.00 × 10^(-9)\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium constant (Ka) for the ionization of acetic acid in water at 25°C is 1.00 × 10^(-9)."
