    "message_2": "When benzene reacts with chloroethane in the presence of anhydrous aluminum chloride (AlCl3) catalyst, the major product formed is ethylbenzene. This reaction is an example of Friedel-Crafts alkylation, where an alkyl group is introduced to the benzene ring.\n\nReaction Mechanism:\n\n1. Generation of electrophile:\nThe reaction begins with the formation of a complex between the chloroethane and the aluminum chloride catalyst. The AlCl3 acts as a Lewis acid, accepting a pair of electrons from the chlorine atom in chloroethane, forming a bond between them. This results in the polarization of the carbon-chlorine bond, making the carbon atom more electrophilic.\n\nCH3CH2Cl + AlCl3 → CH3CH2(+)-Cl(-)-AlCl3\n\n2. Electrophilic attack on benzene:\nThe electrophilic carbon in the CH3CH2(+) species then attacks the benzene ring, breaking one of the pi bonds and forming a bond with the carbon atom. This results in a positively charged cyclohexadienyl cation (Wheland intermediate).\n\n3. Deprotonation and regeneration of catalyst:\nA chloride ion (Cl-) from the AlCl3 complex then abstracts a proton from the cyclohexadienyl cation, restoring the aromaticity of the benzene ring and forming ethylbenzene as the major product. The aluminum chloride catalyst is also regenerated in this step.\n\nCH3CH2(+)-Cl(-)-AlCl3 + H(+)C6H4(-) → CH3CH2C6H5 + HCl + AlCl3\n\nOverall reaction:\nC6H6 + CH3CH2Cl → CH3CH2C6H5 + HCl\n\nThe reaction occurs because the benzene ring is electron-rich due to the delocalization of pi electrons, making it susceptible to attack by electrophiles. The aluminum chloride catalyst increases the electrophilicity of the chloroethane, allowing it to react with the benzene ring. The formation of ethylbenzene is thermodynamically favored due to the restoration of aromaticity in the final product."
