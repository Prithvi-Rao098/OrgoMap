    "message_2": "The photochemical reaction of benzene with chlorine is a substitution reaction known as chlorination. It involves the replacement of one of the hydrogen atoms in the benzene ring with a chlorine atom. The reaction proceeds via a free radical mechanism and requires ultraviolet (UV) light to initiate the process. Here's a step-by-step description of the mechanism:\n\n1. Initiation: The reaction starts with the homolytic cleavage of the chlorine molecule (Cl2) into two chlorine radicals (Cl•) when exposed to UV light. This process is called photodissociation.\n\nUV light\nCl2 → 2 Cl•\n\n2. Propagation: The chlorine radical generated in the initiation step reacts with the benzene molecule to form a benzene radical cation and a hydrochloric acid (HCl) molecule. The benzene radical cation is a highly reactive intermediate species.\n\nBenzene + Cl• → Benzene radical cation + HCl\n\nNext, the benzene radical cation reacts with another chlorine molecule, resulting in the substitution of one hydrogen atom with a chlorine atom, forming chlorobenzene and a new chlorine radical.\n\nBenzene radical cation + Cl2 → Chlorobenzene + Cl•\n\nThe newly formed chlorine radical can then react with another benzene molecule, propagating the reaction.\n\n3. Termination: The reaction can be terminated when two free radicals react with each other, forming a stable molecule. For example, two chlorine radicals can combine to form a chlorine molecule, or a benzene radical cation can react with a chlorine radical to form chlorobenzene.\n\nCl• + Cl• → Cl2\nBenzene radical cation + Cl• → Chlorobenzene\n\nOverall, the photochemical chlorination of benzene results in the formation of chlorobenzene and hydrochloric acid:\n\nBenzene + Cl2 → Chlorobenzene + HCl\n\nIt's important to note that this reaction is not very selective, and multiple chlorination can occur, leading to the formation of di-, tri-, and polychlorinated benzenes as side products."
