    "message_2": "To calculate the formal charge of the chlorine atom in the compound ClO3^-, we can use the following formula:\n\nFormal charge = (Valence electrons of the atom) - (Non-bonding electrons) - (1/2 x Bonding electrons)\n\nIn the ClO3^- ion, the chlorine atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms. Each chlorine-oxygen bond consists of a single bond, so there are 3 bonding electron pairs (6 bonding electrons) around the chlorine atom.\n\nChlorine belongs to Group 7 in the periodic table and has 7 valence electrons. Since there are no lone pairs on the chlorine atom in ClO3^-, the number of non-bonding electrons is 0.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nFormal charge = (7) - (0) - (1/2 x 6)\nFormal charge = 7 - 0 - 3\nFormal charge = +4\n\nHowever, we need to consider the negative charge of the ClO3^- ion. The overall charge of the ion is -1, which means that the sum of the formal charges of all the atoms in the ion should be equal to -1. Since there are three oxygen atoms, each with a formal charge of -2, the total formal charge of the three oxygen atoms is -6. To make the overall charge of the ion equal to -1, the formal charge of the chlorine atom should be:\n\n-6 (total formal charge of oxygen atoms) + x (formal charge of chlorine atom) = -1\nx = -1 + 6\nx = +5\n\nSo, the formal charge of the chlorine atom in the ClO3^- ion is +5. This means that the chlorine atom has a positive formal charge in this compound."
