    "message_2": "In the compound H2SO4 (sulfuric acid), the oxidation state of sulfur is +6. \n\nDuring the redox reaction, sulfur is reduced from H2SO4 to H2S. In H2S, the oxidation state of sulfur is -2. \n\nThe change in oxidation state for sulfur during this reaction is a decrease of 8 units, from +6 in H2SO4 to -2 in H2S."
