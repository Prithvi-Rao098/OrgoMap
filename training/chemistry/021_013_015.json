    "message_2": "The Lewis structure for methane (CH4) consists of a central carbon atom surrounded by four hydrogen atoms. The carbon atom has four valence electrons, and each hydrogen atom has one valence electron. In the Lewis structure, the carbon atom forms four single bonds with the hydrogen atoms, sharing one electron from each hydrogen atom. This results in a full octet for the carbon atom and a filled 1s orbital for each hydrogen atom.\n\nThe Lewis structure can be represented as:\n\n       H\n       |\n    H--C--H\n       |\n       H"
