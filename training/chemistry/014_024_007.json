    "message_2": "The coordination geometry of the metal center in the hemoglobin molecule is an octahedral geometry. Hemoglobin contains an iron (Fe) atom at its center, which is part of a heme group. The iron atom is coordinated to four nitrogen atoms from the porphyrin ring in a square planar arrangement, with one histidine residue from the protein chain (proximal histidine) below the plane and an open coordination site above the plane.\n\nThis open coordination site enables the binding and release of diatomic oxygen (O2). When oxygen is present, it binds to the iron atom at the open coordination site, forming a bent Fe-O-O angle. This binding causes a slight change in the geometry of the iron atom, pulling it into the plane of the porphyrin ring. This change in geometry is transmitted through the protein chain, leading to a conformational change in the hemoglobin molecule that enhances its affinity for oxygen. When the oxygen concentration decreases, the oxygen molecule is released, and the iron atom returns to its original position, allowing the hemoglobin molecule to revert to its lower-affinity state.\n\nMyoglobin, like hemoglobin, also contains a heme group with an iron atom at its center, coordinated in a similar octahedral geometry. However, there are some differences in the coordination chemistry of hemoglobin and myoglobin. Myoglobin is a monomeric protein, while hemoglobin is a tetramer composed of four subunits. This difference in structure leads to different oxygen-binding properties.\n\nMyoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen and serves as an oxygen storage protein in muscle tissue. It binds to oxygen more tightly and does not exhibit cooperative binding, as hemoglobin does. Cooperative binding in hemoglobin allows for efficient oxygen uptake in the lungs and release in tissues where oxygen is needed. In contrast, myoglobin releases oxygen only under very low oxygen concentrations, such as during intense muscle activity.\n\nIn summary, both hemoglobin and myoglobin have an octahedral coordination geometry at their metal center, which enables the binding and release of diatomic oxygen. However, the differences in their structures and oxygen-binding properties allow hemoglobin to function as an oxygen transport protein, while myoglobin serves as an oxygen storage protein."
