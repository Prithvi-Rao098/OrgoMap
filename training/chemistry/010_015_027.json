Also, calculate the cell potential and the Gibbs free energy change for the above reaction.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the overpotential, we need to find the difference between the applied potential and the standard reduction potential.\n\nOverpotential = Applied potential - Standard reduction potential\nOverpotential = (-0.5 V) - (+0.34 V)\nOverpotential = -0.84 V\n\nThe overpotential required to reduce the aqueous solution of 1 M Cu2+ ions to metallic Cu at a cathode potential of -0.5 V is -0.84 V.\n\nNow, let's calculate the cell potential (E_cell) and the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the reaction.\n\nE_cell = E_cathode - E_anode\nSince the reaction is Cu2+ + 2e- → Cu, the anode potential is 0 V (standard hydrogen electrode), and the cathode potential is +0.34 V (given).\n\nE_cell = (+0.34 V) - (0 V)\nE_cell = +0.34 V\n\nThe cell potential for the reaction is +0.34 V.\n\nTo calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG), we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG = -nFE_cell\n\nWhere n is the number of moles of electrons transferred (in this case, n = 2), F is Faraday's constant (approximately 96485 C/mol), and E_cell is the cell potential.\n\nΔG = -(2 mol)(96485 C/mol)(+0.34 V)\nΔG = -65609 J/mol\n\nThe Gibbs free energy change for the reaction is -65609 J/mol or -65.6 kJ/mol."
