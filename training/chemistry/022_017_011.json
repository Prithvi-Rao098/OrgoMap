    "message_1": "Sure, here's a chemistry problem related to Hess's Law: \n\nCalculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction 2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(l) using the following data: \n\n- H2(g) + 1/2O2(g) → H2O(l) ΔH = -285.8 kJ/mol \n- 2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(g) ΔH = -483.6 kJ/mol \n\nHint: Use Hess's Law to add up the given reactions in the right combination to get the target reaction.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to manipulate the given reactions in such a way that when they are added together, they will result in the target reaction: 2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(l).\n\nFirst, let's multiply the first reaction by 2 to match the number of moles of H2 and H2O in the target reaction:\n\n2(H2(g) + 1/2O2(g) → H2O(l)) \n2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(l) ΔH = 2(-285.8 kJ/mol) = -571.6 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we need to convert the H2O from gas to liquid in the second reaction. To do this, we can subtract the enthalpy change of the first reaction (now multiplied by 2) from the enthalpy change of the second reaction:\n\nΔH (target reaction) = ΔH (second reaction) - ΔH (first reaction multiplied by 2)\nΔH (target reaction) = -483.6 kJ/mol - (-571.6 kJ/mol)\nΔH (target reaction) = 88 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change for the target reaction 2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(l) is 88 kJ/mol."
