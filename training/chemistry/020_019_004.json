    "message_2": "The complex ion [Fe(H2O)6]3+ can undergo hydrolysis in water, which means it can lose protons (H+) and form hydroxide ions (OH-) in the process. The hydrolysis reaction can be represented as follows:\n\n[Fe(H2O)6]3+ + H2O ⇌ [Fe(H2O)5(OH)]2+ + H3O+\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is given by:\n\nK = [ [Fe(H2O)5(OH)]2+ ] [H3O+] / [ [Fe(H2O)6]3+ ]\n\nWhen the pH is changed from 2.0 to 3.5, the concentration of H3O+ ions in the solution will decrease. We can calculate the concentration of H3O+ ions at each pH using the formula:\n\n[H3O+] = 10^(-pH)\n\nAt pH 2.0:\n[H3O+] = 10^(-2) = 0.01 M\n\nAt pH 3.5:\n[H3O+] = 10^(-3.5) ≈ 3.16 x 10^(-4) M\n\nAs the concentration of H3O+ ions decreases, the equilibrium will shift to the right to compensate for the change, according to Le Chatelier's principle. This means that more [Fe(H2O)5(OH)]2+ complex ions will be formed, and the concentration of [Fe(H2O)6]3+ complex ions will decrease.\n\nIn conclusion, when the pH is changed from 2.0 to 3.5, the formation of the complex ion [Fe(H2O)6]3+ will be less favored, and the concentration of [Fe(H2O)6]3+ will decrease."
