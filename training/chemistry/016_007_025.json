    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy of formation of water, we need to find the enthalpy change for the formation of 1 mole of water from its elements in their standard states. The given reaction is:\n\n2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(l); ∆H = -572 kJ/mol\n\nFirst, we need to adjust the reaction so that it represents the formation of 1 mole of water:\n\n1/2 * (2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(l))\n\nH2(g) + 1/2 O2(g) → H2O(l)\n\nNow, we need to adjust the enthalpy change for this reaction. Since we have halved the reaction, we also need to halve the enthalpy change:\n\n∆H = -572 kJ/mol * 1/2 = -286 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy of formation (∆Hf) of water (H2O) is -286 kJ/mol."
