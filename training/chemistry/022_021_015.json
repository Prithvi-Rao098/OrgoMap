    "message_1": "Sure, here is a question for a chemistry student to solve related to Equilibrium constant calculations:\n\nWhat is the equilibrium constant expression for the reaction: \n2 NO2(g) --> N2O4(g)\n\nIf the equilibrium concentration of N2O4 is 0.0250 M and the equilibrium concentration of NO2 is 0.367 M, what is the value of the equilibrium constant, Kc?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, first, we need to write the equilibrium constant expression for the given reaction. The equilibrium constant expression (Kc) is the ratio of the concentrations of the products to the concentrations of the reactants, each raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients.\n\nFor the reaction: 2 NO2(g) --> N2O4(g)\n\nThe equilibrium constant expression (Kc) can be written as:\n\nKc = [N2O4] / [NO2]^2\n\nNow, we are given the equilibrium concentrations of N2O4 and NO2:\n\n[N2O4] = 0.0250 M\n[NO2] = 0.367 M\n\nPlug these values into the Kc expression:\n\nKc = (0.0250) / (0.367)^2\n\nNow, calculate the value of Kc:\n\nKc â‰ˆ 0.185\n\nSo, the value of the equilibrium constant, Kc, for this reaction is approximately 0.185."
