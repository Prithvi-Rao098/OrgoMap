    "message_2": "To calculate the cell potential of the given electrochemical reaction, we can use the Nernst equation:\n\nE_cell = E°_cell - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\n\nwhere:\nE_cell = cell potential\nE°_cell = standard cell potential\nR = gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\nT = temperature (in Kelvin, assuming 298 K or 25°C)\nn = number of electrons transferred (2 for this reaction, as both Cu and Zn have a charge of +2)\nF = Faraday's constant (96,485 C/mol)\nQ = reaction quotient, which is [Zn^2+]/[Cu^2+]\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the standard cell potential (E°_cell):\n\nE°_cell = E°_reduction(Cu^2+) - E°_reduction(Zn^2+)\nE°_cell = (+0.34 V) - (-0.76 V)\nE°_cell = 1.10 V\n\nNow, we can calculate the cell potential using the Nernst equation:\n\nE_cell = 1.10 V - (8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K) / (2 * 96,485 C/mol) * ln(0.1 M / 1.0 M)\nE_cell = 1.10 V - (0.0257 V) * ln(0.1)\nE_cell ≈ 1.10 V + 0.0592 V\nE_cell ≈ 1.1592 V\n\nThe cell potential of the given electrochemical reaction is approximately 1.1592 V."
