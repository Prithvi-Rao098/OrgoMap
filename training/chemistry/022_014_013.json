    "message_1": "What mass of hydrogen gas can be produced from the reaction of 2.50 grams of magnesium with excess hydrochloric acid if the percent yield is 80%?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between magnesium and hydrochloric acid:\n\nMg (s) + 2HCl (aq) → MgCl2 (aq) + H2 (g)\n\nNext, we will need to find the molar mass of magnesium (Mg) and hydrogen gas (H2). The molar mass of Mg is 24.31 g/mol, and the molar mass of H2 is 2.02 g/mol.\n\nNow, we will convert the mass of magnesium (2.50 g) to moles:\n\nmoles of Mg = mass of Mg / molar mass of Mg\nmoles of Mg = 2.50 g / 24.31 g/mol\nmoles of Mg ≈ 0.1028 mol\n\nFrom the balanced chemical equation, we can see that 1 mole of Mg reacts with 1 mole of H2. Therefore, the moles of H2 produced will be the same as the moles of Mg:\n\nmoles of H2 = moles of Mg\nmoles of H2 ≈ 0.1028 mol\n\nNow, we will convert the moles of H2 to mass:\n\nmass of H2 = moles of H2 × molar mass of H2\nmass of H2 = 0.1028 mol × 2.02 g/mol\nmass of H2 ≈ 0.2076 g\n\nSince the percent yield is 80%, we will need to multiply the mass of H2 by the percent yield:\n\nmass of H2 (actual) = mass of H2 (theoretical) × percent yield\nmass of H2 (actual) = 0.2076 g × 0.80\nmass of H2 (actual) ≈ 0.1661 g\n\nTherefore, approximately 0.1661 grams of hydrogen gas can be produced from the reaction of 2.50 grams of magnesium with excess hydrochloric acid if the percent yield is 80%."
