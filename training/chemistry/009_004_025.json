    "message_2": "The minimum temperature required for nuclear fusion reactions to occur is approximately 100 million Kelvin (100 MK or 180 million degrees Fahrenheit). This high temperature is necessary to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged atomic nuclei, allowing them to get close enough for the strong nuclear force to bind them together.\n\nThe elements typically used in fusion reactors are isotopes of hydrogen, specifically deuterium (²H) and tritium (³H). These isotopes have one proton and one or two neutrons, respectively. The fusion of deuterium and tritium produces helium and a neutron, releasing a large amount of energy in the process. This reaction is the most commonly studied and pursued for fusion energy production due to its relatively low temperature requirement and high energy output."
