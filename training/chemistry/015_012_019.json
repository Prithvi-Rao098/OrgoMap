    "message_2": "Intermolecular forces play a crucial role in determining the solubility of polar and nonpolar molecules in different solvents. Solubility is the ability of a solute to dissolve in a solvent, and it depends on the interactions between the solute and solvent molecules. The main types of intermolecular forces are hydrogen bonding, dipole-dipole interactions, and dispersion (London) forces.\n\n1. Polar molecules: These molecules have a net dipole moment due to the presence of polar bonds, which arise from the difference in electronegativity between the atoms involved in the bond. Examples of polar molecules include water (H2O), ammonia (NH3), and ethanol (C2H5OH).\n\nIn polar solvents, such as water, polar molecules can dissolve due to the strong dipole-dipole interactions and hydrogen bonding between the solute and solvent molecules. These interactions help to overcome the intermolecular forces within the solute, allowing it to dissolve.\n\nHowever, in nonpolar solvents, such as hexane or benzene, polar molecules have limited solubility. This is because the nonpolar solvent molecules cannot form strong interactions with the polar solute molecules, and the solute's intermolecular forces are not sufficiently overcome to allow it to dissolve.\n\n2. Nonpolar molecules: These molecules do not have a net dipole moment, as they either have nonpolar bonds or their polar bonds are arranged symmetrically, canceling out the dipoles. Examples of nonpolar molecules include methane (CH4), carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), and diethyl ether (C4H10O).\n\nIn nonpolar solvents, nonpolar molecules can dissolve due to the dispersion forces between the solute and solvent molecules. These weak interactions are enough to overcome the intermolecular forces within the solute, allowing it to dissolve.\n\nHowever, in polar solvents, nonpolar molecules have limited solubility. This is because the polar solvent molecules form strong intermolecular forces with each other (such as hydrogen bonding) that the nonpolar solute molecules cannot disrupt. As a result, the solute's intermolecular forces are not sufficiently overcome, and it does not dissolve.\n\nThis concept is summarized by the phrase \"like dissolves like,\" which means that polar solutes tend to dissolve in polar solvents, and nonpolar solutes tend to dissolve in nonpolar solvents. The solubility of a substance in a particular solvent is determined by the balance between the intermolecular forces within the solute, the solvent, and the interactions between the solute and solvent molecules."
