    "message_2": "The effect of increasing the temperature on the equilibrium constant (Kc) for a reaction depends on whether the reaction is exothermic or endothermic.\n\n1. For an exothermic reaction (releases heat, ΔH < 0):\nAccording to Le Chatelier's Principle, if a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in temperature, the system will adjust itself to counteract the change. In this case, increasing the temperature will cause the system to shift in the direction that absorbs heat, which is the reverse (endothermic) direction. As a result, the equilibrium constant (Kc) will decrease.\n\n2. For an endothermic reaction (absorbs heat, ΔH > 0):\nIn this case, increasing the temperature will cause the system to shift in the direction that absorbs heat, which is the forward (endothermic) direction. As a result, the equilibrium constant (Kc) will increase.\n\nIn summary, the effect of increasing the temperature on the equilibrium constant (Kc) depends on the nature of the reaction. For exothermic reactions, Kc will decrease, while for endothermic reactions, Kc will increase. This observation is based on Le Chatelier's Principle, which states that a system at equilibrium will adjust itself to counteract any changes in temperature."
