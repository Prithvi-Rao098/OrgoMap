    "message_1": "A chemistry student needs to determine the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction:\n \nN2(g) + 3H2(g) â‡Œ 2NH3(g)\n\nAt a certain temperature, 0.2 mole of nitrogen gas (N2), 0.3 mole of hydrogen gas (H2), and 0.4 mole of ammonia gas (NH3) were placed in a 1 L container. Using these initial concentrations, what is the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction?",
    "message_2": "To determine the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction, we first need to write the expression for Kc:\n\nKc = [NH3]^2 / ([N2] * [H2]^3)\n\nNext, we need to find the equilibrium concentrations of each species. Since we are given the initial concentrations and the volume of the container, we can calculate the initial molar concentrations:\n\n[N2]_initial = 0.2 moles / 1 L = 0.2 M\n[H2]_initial = 0.3 moles / 1 L = 0.3 M\n[NH3]_initial = 0.4 moles / 1 L = 0.4 M\n\nNow, let's denote the change in concentration for each species as they reach equilibrium:\n\nN2: -x\nH2: -3x\nNH3: +2x\n\nAt equilibrium, the concentrations will be:\n\n[N2]_equilibrium = 0.2 - x\n[H2]_equilibrium = 0.3 - 3x\n[NH3]_equilibrium = 0.4 + 2x\n\nNow, we can substitute these equilibrium concentrations into the Kc expression:\n\nKc = [(0.4 + 2x)^2] / ([(0.2 - x) * (0.3 - 3x)^3])\n\nHowever, we are not given enough information to determine the value of x. We would need either the equilibrium concentrations or the value of Kc at the given temperature to solve for x and then calculate Kc."
