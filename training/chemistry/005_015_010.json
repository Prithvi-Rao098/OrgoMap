    "message_2": "In eukaryotic cells, one molecule of glucose goes through several metabolic processes, including glycolysis, the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle), and oxidative phosphorylation (which includes the electron transport chain and chemiosmosis). Here is the breakdown of ATP production and electron carrier utilization for each process:\n\n1. Glycolysis:\n- Net ATP production: 2 ATP (substrate-level phosphorylation)\n- Electron carrier utilization: 2 NADH molecules are produced.\n\n2. Pyruvate decarboxylation (conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA):\n- No ATP is produced in this step.\n- Electron carrier utilization: 1 NADH molecule is produced per pyruvate, so 2 NADH molecules are produced for one glucose molecule (since 2 pyruvates are produced from one glucose).\n\n3. Citric acid cycle:\n- ATP production: 1 ATP is produced per cycle through substrate-level phosphorylation, so 2 ATP are produced for one glucose molecule (since 2 cycles occur for each glucose molecule).\n- Electron carrier utilization: For each cycle, 3 NADH and 1 FADH₂ are produced. So, for one glucose molecule, 6 NADH and 2 FADH₂ are produced.\n\n4. Oxidative phosphorylation:\n- ATP production: NADH and FADH₂ are oxidized in the electron transport chain, and the released energy is used to pump protons across the mitochondrial membrane, creating a proton gradient. This gradient drives ATP synthesis through chemiosmosis. Each NADH molecule generates approximately 2.5 ATP, and each FADH₂ molecule generates approximately 1.5 ATP. \n\nTotal electron carriers from all processes:\n- NADH: 2 (glycolysis) + 2 (pyruvate decarboxylation) + 6 (citric acid cycle) = 10 NADH\n- FADH₂: 2 (citric acid cycle)\n\nTotal ATP production from oxidative phosphorylation:\n- From NADH: 10 NADH × 2.5 ATP/NADH = 25 ATP\n- From FADH₂: 2 FADH₂ × 1.5 ATP/FADH₂ = 3 ATP\n\nNet ATP production from all processes:\n- Glycolysis: 2 ATP\n- Citric acid cycle: 2 ATP\n- Oxidative phosphorylation: 25 ATP (from NADH) + 3 ATP (from FADH₂) = 28 ATP\n\nSo, for one molecule of glucose in eukaryotic cells, the net ATP production by the end of the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation is 32 ATP (2 from glycolysis, 2 from the citric acid cycle, and 28 from oxidative phosphorylation). The electron carrier utilization includes 10 NADH and 2 FADH₂ molecules."
