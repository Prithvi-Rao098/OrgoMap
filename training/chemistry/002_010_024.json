    "message_2": "To find the density of silver chloride (AgCl), we can use the formula:\n\nDensity = Mass / Volume\n\nGiven:\nMass = 34.2 g\nVolume = 25 mL\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nDensity = 34.2 g / 25 mL\nDensity = 1.368 g/mL\n\nTherefore, the density of silver chloride (AgCl) is 1.368 g/mL."
