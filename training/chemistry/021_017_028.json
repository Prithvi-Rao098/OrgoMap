    "message_2": "In a liquid sample of ethanol, there are three types of intermolecular forces present:\n\n1. Hydrogen bonding: Ethanol (C2H5OH) has an -OH group, which forms hydrogen bonds with other ethanol molecules. This is the strongest type of intermolecular force present in ethanol.\n\n2. Dipole-dipole interactions: Ethanol is a polar molecule due to the electronegativity difference between oxygen and hydrogen in the -OH group. This results in dipole-dipole interactions between ethanol molecules.\n\n3. London dispersion forces: These are weak, temporary attractive forces that exist between all molecules, including nonpolar ones, due to the constant motion of electrons. They are present in ethanol as well, but they are weaker than hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions."
