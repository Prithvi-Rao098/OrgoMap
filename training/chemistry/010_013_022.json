    "message_2": "To determine the number of electrons transferred in the given electrochemical reaction, we first need to write the balanced half-reactions for the oxidation and reduction processes.\n\n1. Identify the oxidation and reduction processes:\nIn this reaction, Cu(s) is oxidized to Cu2+(aq), and Ag+(aq) is reduced to Ag(s).\n\n2. Write the unbalanced half-reactions:\nOxidation half-reaction: Cu(s) → Cu2+(aq)\nReduction half-reaction: Ag+(aq) → Ag(s)\n\n3. Balance the atoms other than O and H in each half-reaction:\nOxidation half-reaction: Cu(s) → Cu2+(aq)\nReduction half-reaction: Ag+(aq) → Ag(s)\n\n4. Balance the O atoms by adding H2O:\nThere are no O atoms in either half-reaction, so this step is not necessary.\n\n5. Balance the H atoms by adding H+:\nThere are no H atoms in either half-reaction, so this step is not necessary.\n\n6. Balance the charges by adding electrons (e-):\nOxidation half-reaction: Cu(s) → Cu2+(aq) + 2e-\nReduction half-reaction: Ag+(aq) + 1e- → Ag(s)\n\n7. Make the number of electrons equal in both half-reactions:\nThe oxidation half-reaction has 2 electrons, and the reduction half-reaction has 1 electron. To make the number of electrons equal, we need to multiply the reduction half-reaction by 2:\n\nOxidation half-reaction: Cu(s) → Cu2+(aq) + 2e-\nReduction half-reaction: 2Ag+(aq) + 2e- → 2Ag(s)\n\n8. Add the half-reactions together and cancel out the electrons:\nCu(s) + 2Ag+(aq) → Cu2+(aq) + 2Ag(s)\n\nThe balanced electrochemical reaction is:\nCu(s) + 2Ag+(aq) → Cu2+(aq) + 2Ag(s)\n\nThe number of electrons transferred in this reaction is 2."
