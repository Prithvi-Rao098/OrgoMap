    "message_2": "The photochemical degradation of the pesticide chlorpyrifos in water solution involves a series of reactions initiated by the absorption of light energy. The process can be influenced by the wavelength of the light, the presence of dissolved oxygen, and other factors. Here is a general outline of the mechanism:\n\n1. Absorption of light: Chlorpyrifos molecules absorb light energy, particularly in the UV and near-visible range (around 290-400 nm). This absorption promotes the molecule to an excited state.\n\n2. Homolytic cleavage: The excited chlorpyrifos molecule undergoes homolytic cleavage, breaking the P-S bond and forming two radicals: a thiophosphate radical and a chloropyridinyl radical.\n\n3. Reaction with dissolved oxygen: The thiophosphate radical can react with dissolved oxygen in the water, forming a peroxy radical.\n\n4. Hydrolysis: The peroxy radical can undergo hydrolysis, leading to the formation of 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCP) and diethyl phosphate. The chloropyridinyl radical can also undergo hydrolysis, forming TCP and diethyl thiophosphate.\n\n5. Further degradation: TCP, diethyl phosphate, and diethyl thiophosphate can undergo further photochemical and hydrolytic reactions, leading to the formation of various degradation products.\n\nThe efficiency of the photochemical degradation process depends on the wavelength of the light. Chlorpyrifos has a higher absorption coefficient at shorter wavelengths (UV range), which means that it is more likely to absorb light and undergo degradation at these wavelengths. As the wavelength increases (towards the visible range), the absorption coefficient decreases, and the degradation process becomes less efficient.\n\nIn summary, the photochemical degradation of chlorpyrifos in water solution involves the absorption of light energy, homolytic cleavage, reaction with dissolved oxygen, and hydrolysis, leading to the formation of various degradation products. The efficiency of the process depends on the wavelength of the light, with shorter wavelengths (UV range) being more effective in promoting degradation."
