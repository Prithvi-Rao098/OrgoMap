    "message_2": "To identify the unknown compound using mass spectrometry, we can analyze the fragment peaks and try to deduce the possible structure of the compound. \n\n1. Molecular ion peak (M+) at m/z 162: This peak represents the molecular weight of the compound. \n\n2. Fragment peaks: \n- m/z 135: The difference between the molecular ion peak and this fragment peak is 162 - 135 = 27. This suggests that a fragment with a mass of 27 was lost from the molecular ion. A common fragment with a mass of 27 is ethoxy (C2H5O, 2x12 + 5x1 + 16 = 27).\n- m/z 91: The difference between the molecular ion peak and this fragment peak is 162 - 91 = 71. A common fragment with a mass of 71 is benzyl (C7H7, 7x12 + 7x1 = 71).\n- m/z 77: This fragment peak is characteristic of a benzene ring (C6H6, 6x12 + 6x1 = 78, but one hydrogen is lost during fragmentation, so m/z = 77).\n\nBased on the above analysis, the unknown compound likely contains an ethoxy group and a benzyl group. The sum of their masses is 27 (ethoxy) + 71 (benzyl) = 98. The remaining mass to reach the molecular ion peak is 162 - 98 = 64. A common fragment with a mass of 64 is dimethylamine (C2H8N, 2x12 + 8x1 + 14 = 64).\n\nPutting all these fragments together, we can deduce the molecular formula of the unknown compound as C11H17NO (11x12 + 17x1 + 14 + 16 = 162). The structure of the compound is likely to be N,N-dimethylbenzyl ethoxy amine."
