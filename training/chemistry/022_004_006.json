    "message_2": "In the compound H2SO4 (sulfuric acid), the oxidation state of sulfur can be determined by considering the oxidation states of the other elements in the compound. Hydrogen has an oxidation state of +1, and oxygen has an oxidation state of -2.\n\nThe overall charge of the compound is neutral (0). There are two hydrogen atoms, each with an oxidation state of +1, contributing a total of +2. There are four oxygen atoms, each with an oxidation state of -2, contributing a total of -8.\n\nTo balance the charges and achieve a neutral compound, the oxidation state of sulfur (S) must be +6. This is because:\n\n(+2) + (S) + (-8) = 0\nS = +6\n\nSo, the oxidation state of sulfur in H2SO4 is +6."
