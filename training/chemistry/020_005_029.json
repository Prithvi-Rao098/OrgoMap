    "message_2": "The Haber process is the industrial method for the production of ammonia (NH3) from nitrogen (N2) and hydrogen (H2) gases. The balanced equation for the Haber process is:\n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g)\n\nThis reaction is reversible and reaches a state of equilibrium when the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction. The concentrations of the reactants and products remain constant at equilibrium.\n\nAccording to Le Chatelier's principle, if a change is made to a system at equilibrium, the system will adjust itself to counteract that change and restore a new equilibrium. In this case, the addition of H2 gas to a sealed container at equilibrium will disturb the equilibrium.\n\nWhen the concentration of H2 gas is increased, the system will try to counteract this change by consuming the excess H2 gas. This will cause the forward reaction (the formation of NH3) to proceed at a faster rate than the reverse reaction. As a result, the concentration of N2 will decrease, and the concentration of NH3 will increase.\n\nThe presence of H2O is not directly involved in the balanced equation for the Haber process. However, if water is present in the system, it can affect the equilibrium by reacting with NH3 to form NH4+ and OH- ions:\n\nNH3(aq) + H2O(l) ⇌ NH4+(aq) + OH-(aq)\n\nThis reaction is also reversible and can reach a state of equilibrium. The addition of H2 gas to the system will not directly affect the concentration of H2O, but it may indirectly affect the concentrations of NH4+ and OH- ions by changing the concentration of NH3.\n\nIn summary, the addition of H2 gas to a sealed container at equilibrium in the Haber process will cause the concentration of N2 to decrease, the concentration of NH3 to increase, and may indirectly affect the concentrations of NH4+ and OH- ions if water is present in the system."
