Provide calculations to illustrate the effect of changing the concentration of a salt on the solubility of a sparingly soluble salt using appropriate chemical equations and equilibrium constants.",
    "message_2": "The solubility of a sparingly soluble salt can be affected by the presence of another salt in the solution through a phenomenon called the common ion effect. The common ion effect occurs when two salts share a common ion, and the presence of that ion in the solution affects the solubility of the sparingly soluble salt.\n\nLet's consider the sparingly soluble salt, silver chloride (AgCl), which has a solubility product constant (Ksp) of 1.77 x 10^(-10) at 25°C. The dissociation of AgCl in water can be represented by the following equilibrium equation:\n\nAgCl(s) ⇌ Ag⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq)\n\nThe solubility product constant expression for this reaction is:\n\nKsp = [Ag⁺][Cl⁻]\n\nNow, let's consider the effect of adding another salt, sodium chloride (NaCl), to the solution. NaCl is a highly soluble salt and dissociates completely in water:\n\nNaCl(s) → Na⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq)\n\nWhen NaCl is added to the solution, the concentration of Cl⁻ ions increases. According to Le Chatelier's principle, the equilibrium of the sparingly soluble salt (AgCl) will shift to the left to counteract the increase in Cl⁻ ions, resulting in the precipitation of more AgCl and a decrease in its solubility.\n\nTo illustrate this effect quantitatively, let's assume that we initially have a saturated solution of AgCl with no NaCl present. In this case, the concentrations of Ag⁺ and Cl⁻ ions are equal:\n\n[Ag⁺] = [Cl⁻] = S (where S is the solubility of AgCl)\n\nThe Ksp expression becomes:\n\nKsp = S²\n\nSolving for S:\n\nS = √(Ksp) = √(1.77 x 10^(-10)) ≈ 1.33 x 10^(-5) M\n\nNow, let's add NaCl to the solution, which increases the concentration of Cl⁻ ions. Suppose we add enough NaCl to make the concentration of Cl⁻ ions 0.1 M. The new equilibrium expression for AgCl becomes:\n\nKsp = [Ag⁺]([Cl⁻] + S)\n\nSince the concentration of Cl⁻ ions from NaCl (0.1 M) is much larger than the concentration of Cl⁻ ions from AgCl (1.33 x 10^(-5) M), we can approximate the new equilibrium expression as:\n\nKsp ≈ [Ag⁺][Cl⁻]\n\nNow, we can solve for the new solubility (S') of AgCl:\n\nS' = Ksp / [Cl⁻] = (1.77 x 10^(-10)) / 0.1 ≈ 1.77 x 10^(-9) M\n\nAs we can see, the solubility of AgCl has decreased significantly due to the presence of the common ion, Cl⁻, from the added NaCl. This demonstrates the common ion effect and how the solubility of a sparingly soluble salt can be affected by the concentration of another salt in the solution."
