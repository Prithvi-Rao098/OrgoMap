    "message_1": "What is the equilibrium constant for the dissociation of acetic acid (CH3COOH) in water at 25°C, given that its initial concentration is 0.1 M and the equilibrium concentration of hydrogen ions is 1.8 × 10^-5 M? The equation for the dissociation of acetic acid is CH3COOH ⇌ CH3COO^- + H+.",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (K_a) for the dissociation of acetic acid, we can use the expression:\n\nK_a = [CH3COO^-][H+]/[CH3COOH]\n\nAt equilibrium, the concentration of CH3COO^- and H+ ions are equal, which is given as 1.8 × 10^-5 M. Since the initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.1 M, and a small amount dissociates, we can assume that the change in concentration is negligible. Therefore, the equilibrium concentration of CH3COOH is approximately 0.1 M.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the K_a expression:\n\nK_a = (1.8 × 10^-5)(1.8 × 10^-5)/(0.1)\nK_a = 3.24 × 10^-10\n\nThe equilibrium constant for the dissociation of acetic acid in water at 25°C is approximately 3.24 × 10^-10."
