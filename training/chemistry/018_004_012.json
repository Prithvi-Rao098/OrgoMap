    "message_2": "To determine the activation energy (Ea) of the reaction between hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and iodide ions (I-), we need to know the rate constant (k) of the reaction at two different temperatures and the Arrhenius equation. The Arrhenius equation is given by:\n\nk = A * e^(-Ea / RT)\n\nwhere k is the rate constant, A is the pre-exponential factor, Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/molÂ·K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nHowever, the problem statement does not provide the rate constants at two different temperatures or any other information to determine the activation energy. Therefore, it is not possible to calculate the activation energy for this reaction with the given information.\n\nIf you can provide the rate constants at two different temperatures or any other relevant information, I would be happy to help you with the calculations."
