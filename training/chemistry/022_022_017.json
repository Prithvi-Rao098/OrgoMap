    "message_2": "Le Chatelier's principle states that if a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in pressure, temperature, or concentration of reactants and products, the system will adjust its equilibrium position to counteract the change.\n\nIn this case, we are given the reaction:\n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g)\n\nAnd we are asked to determine the direction in which the equilibrium position will shift if the pressure is increased.\n\nTo determine the direction of the shift, we need to consider the effect of pressure on the reaction. When the pressure is increased, the system will try to counteract the change by shifting the equilibrium position to the side with fewer moles of gas, as this will reduce the pressure.\n\nIn this reaction, there are 1 mole of N2 and 3 moles of H2 on the reactant side, for a total of 4 moles of gas. On the product side, there are 2 moles of NH3. Since there are fewer moles of gas on the product side, increasing the pressure will cause the equilibrium position to shift to the right, favoring the formation of NH3.\n\nTherefore, according to Le Chatelier's principle, the equilibrium position will shift to the right when the pressure is increased."
