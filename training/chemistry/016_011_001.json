    "message_2": "When 100 mL of 1.0 M HCl is mixed with 100 mL of 1.0 M NaOH, the reaction that occurs is an acid-base neutralization reaction:\n\nHCl + NaOH → NaCl + H2O\n\nFirst, we need to determine the mass of the resulting solution. Since the density of water is approximately 1 g/mL, the mass of the 200 mL solution is approximately 200 g.\n\nNext, we can calculate the heat absorbed or released by the solution using the specific heat formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat absorbed or released, m is the mass of the solution, c is the specific heat, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nΔT = T_final - T_initial = 30°C - 25°C = 5°C\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nq = (200 g)(4.18 J/g°C)(5°C) = 4180 J\n\nSince the temperature of the solution increased, the heat of mixing is exothermic, and the heat released is 4180 J."
