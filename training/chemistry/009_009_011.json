    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of energy produced by a nuclear reactor undergoing fission of 1.0 kg of uranium-235, we need to consider the energy released per fission event and the number of fission events occurring.\n\n1. Energy released per fission event:\nThe energy released per fission event of uranium-235 is approximately 200 MeV (million electron volts).\n\n2. Convert MeV to Joules:\n1 MeV = 1.602 x 10^(-13) Joules\nSo, 200 MeV = 200 * 1.602 x 10^(-13) Joules = 3.204 x 10^(-11) Joules\n\n3. Number of fission events:\n1.0 kg of uranium-235 contains (1.0 kg) / (235 g/mol) * (6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol) = 2.568 x 10^24 atoms\n\n4. Total energy released:\nTotal energy released = (number of fission events) * (energy released per fission event)\nTotal energy released = (2.568 x 10^24 atoms) * (3.204 x 10^(-11) Joules/atom) = 8.226 x 10^13 Joules\n\n5. Electric power produced with 40% efficiency:\nElectric power produced = (total energy released) * (efficiency)\nElectric power produced = (8.226 x 10^13 Joules) * (0.40) = 3.290 x 10^13 Joules\n\nSo, the amount of energy produced by a nuclear reactor undergoing fission of 1.0 kg of uranium-235 with a 40% efficiency in converting the released energy into electric power is 3.290 x 10^13 Joules."
