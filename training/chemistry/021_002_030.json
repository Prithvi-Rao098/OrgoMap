    "message_2": "The bond length between two carbon atoms in a molecule of ethylene (C2H4) is given as the distance between the nuclei of the two carbon atoms, which is 1.33 Å (angstroms). \n\nTo determine the percent ionic character of the carbon-carbon bond, we need to consider the electronegativity difference between the two carbon atoms. Since both atoms are carbon, their electronegativity values are the same (2.55). The electronegativity difference is therefore 0. \n\nPercent ionic character can be estimated using the equation:\n\nPercent ionic character = 100 × (1 - exp(-0.25 × (electronegativity difference)^2))\n\nIn this case, since the electronegativity difference is 0, the equation becomes:\n\nPercent ionic character = 100 × (1 - exp(-0.25 × (0)^2)) = 100 × (1 - exp(0)) = 100 × (1 - 1) = 0%\n\nThe percent ionic character of the carbon-carbon bond in ethylene is 0%, indicating that the bond is purely covalent."
