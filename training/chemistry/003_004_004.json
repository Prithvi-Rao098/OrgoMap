    "message_2": "To find the standard cell potential of the given electrochemical cell, we can use the Nernst equation:\n\nE_cell = E°_cell - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\n\nwhere E_cell is the cell potential, E°_cell is the standard cell potential, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin (298 K), n is the number of electrons transferred, F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol), and Q is the reaction quotient.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the half-reactions:\n\nCu2+ + 2e- -> Cu(s) (reduction)\nAg+ + e- -> Ag(s) (reduction)\n\nSince we need an oxidation half-reaction, we can reverse the Cu2+ reduction half-reaction:\n\nCu(s) -> Cu2+ + 2e- (oxidation)\n\nNow, we can find the standard reduction potentials for both half-reactions:\n\nE°(Cu2+/Cu) = +0.34 V (reduction)\nE°(Ag+/Ag) = +0.80 V (reduction)\n\nSince we reversed the Cu2+ half-reaction, we need to change the sign of its standard reduction potential:\n\nE°(Cu/Cu2+) = -0.34 V (oxidation)\n\nNow, we can find the standard cell potential (E°_cell):\n\nE°_cell = E°(Ag+/Ag) - E°(Cu/Cu2+) = 0.80 V - (-0.34 V) = 1.14 V\n\nNext, we need to find the reaction quotient (Q):\n\nQ = [Cu2+]/[Ag+] = (1.0 x 10^-2)/(1.0 x 10^-4) = 100\n\nNow, we can plug everything into the Nernst equation:\n\nE_cell = 1.14 V - (8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K / (2 * 96,485 C/mol)) * ln(100)\nE_cell = 1.14 V - (0.0257 V) * ln(100)\nE_cell = 1.14 V - 0.0257 V * 4.605\nE_cell ≈ 1.14 V - 0.118 V\nE_cell ≈ 1.022 V\n\nSo, the standard cell potential of the given electrochemical cell at 298 K with the given concentrations is approximately 1.022 V."
