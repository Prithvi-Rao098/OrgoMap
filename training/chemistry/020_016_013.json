    "message_2": "The effect of increasing the concentration of NaCl in a solution on the solubility of a sparingly soluble salt, such as AgCl, can be explained using the common ion effect. The common ion effect states that the solubility of a sparingly soluble salt decreases in the presence of a common ion.\n\nAgCl is a sparingly soluble salt that dissociates into its ions as follows:\n\nAgCl(s) ⇌ Ag⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq)\n\nThe solubility product constant (Ksp) for AgCl is 1.8 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n\nKsp = [Ag⁺][Cl⁻]\n\nWhen NaCl is added to the solution, it dissociates completely into its ions:\n\nNaCl(s) → Na⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq)\n\nSince Cl⁻ is a common ion in both reactions, the increase in Cl⁻ concentration due to the addition of NaCl will shift the equilibrium of the AgCl dissociation reaction to the left, according to Le Chatelier's principle. This results in a decrease in the solubility of AgCl.\n\nTo show this effect mathematically, let's assume that the initial concentration of Cl⁻ ions due to the addition of NaCl is [Cl⁻]₀. Let 's' be the solubility of AgCl in the presence of NaCl. Then, the total concentration of Cl⁻ ions in the solution will be [Cl⁻]₀ + s. The concentration of Ag⁺ ions will be equal to 's'.\n\nNow, we can write the Ksp expression for AgCl in the presence of NaCl:\n\nKsp = [Ag⁺][Cl⁻] = s([Cl⁻]₀ + s)\n\nSince AgCl is sparingly soluble and Ksp is very small, we can assume that s is much smaller than [Cl⁻]₀. Therefore, [Cl⁻]₀ + s ≈ [Cl⁻]₀.\n\nNow, the Ksp expression becomes:\n\nKsp = s[Cl⁻]₀\n\nSolving for s:\n\ns = Ksp / [Cl⁻]₀\n\nAs we can see from this equation, the solubility of AgCl (s) is inversely proportional to the concentration of Cl⁻ ions in the solution. Therefore, increasing the concentration of NaCl, and consequently the concentration of Cl⁻ ions, will result in a decrease in the solubility of AgCl."
