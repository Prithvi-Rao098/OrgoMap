    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change of the reaction, we can use the formula:\n\nΔH_reaction = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH_f is the enthalpy change of formation for each compound.\n\nFor the reactants, we have 1 mole of Ca(OH)2 and 2 moles of HCl:\nΣ ΔH_f(reactants) = (-986 kJ/mol)(1 mol Ca(OH)2) + (-92.32 kJ/mol)(2 mol HCl) = -986 - 184.64 = -1170.64 kJ\n\nFor the products, we have 1 mole of CaCl2 and 2 moles of H2O:\nΣ ΔH_f(products) = (-732 kJ/mol)(1 mol CaCl2) + (-241.82 kJ/mol)(2 mol H2O) = -732 - 483.64 = -1215.64 kJ\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change of the reaction:\nΔH_reaction = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants) = -1215.64 kJ - (-1170.64 kJ) = -45 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change of the reaction is -45 kJ."
