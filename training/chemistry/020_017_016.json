    "message_1": "What is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex ion [Ni(NH3)6]2+ if 0.025 moles of nickel (II) sulfate (NiSO4) is mixed with 0.050 moles of ammonia (NH3) in a total volume of 250 mL at 25 degrees Celsius? The balanced equation for the reaction is:\n\nNi2+ (aq) + 6 NH3 (aq) ⇌ [Ni(NH3)6]2+ (aq)",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the formation of the complex ion [Ni(NH3)6]2+, we need to first determine the equilibrium concentrations of the reactants and products. We can do this by setting up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table.\n\nInitial concentrations:\n[Ni2+] = 0.025 moles / 0.250 L = 0.1 M\n[NH3] = 0.050 moles / 0.250 L = 0.2 M\n[[Ni(NH3)6]2+] = 0 M (since none has formed yet)\n\nChange in concentrations:\nLet x be the change in concentration of Ni2+ and [Ni(NH3)6]2+. Since 6 moles of NH3 react with 1 mole of Ni2+, the change in concentration of NH3 will be 6x.\n\nEquilibrium concentrations:\n[Ni2+] = 0.1 - x\n[NH3] = 0.2 - 6x\n[[Ni(NH3)6]2+] = x\n\nNow we can set up the expression for the equilibrium constant Kc:\n\nKc = [[Ni(NH3)6]2+] / ([Ni2+] * [NH3]^6)\n\nSince we don't have the value of Kc, we cannot directly solve for x. However, we can make some assumptions to simplify the problem. If the value of x is small compared to the initial concentrations, we can assume that 0.1 - x ≈ 0.1 and 0.2 - 6x ≈ 0.2. This is a common approximation when dealing with equilibrium problems.\n\nWith these approximations, the expression for Kc becomes:\n\nKc ≈ (x) / (0.1 * 0.2^6)\n\nNow, we need the value of Kc to solve for x. Unfortunately, the problem statement does not provide the value of Kc. If you have the value of Kc, you can plug it into the equation above and solve for x, which will give you the equilibrium concentrations of the reactants and products."
