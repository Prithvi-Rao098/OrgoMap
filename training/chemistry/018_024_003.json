    "message_2": "The effect of temperature on the reaction sustainability of the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by potassium iodide can be explained using the collision theory and the concept of activation energy.\n\nAs the temperature increases, the kinetic energy of the reacting molecules also increases. This leads to more frequent and energetic collisions between the hydrogen peroxide and potassium iodide molecules. As a result, the reaction rate increases, and the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide occurs more rapidly.\n\nHowever, there is an optimal temperature range for this reaction, typically around 60-70Â°C. Beyond this range, the reaction rate may decrease due to the denaturation of the iodide ions, which are essential for the catalytic process. Additionally, at extremely high temperatures, hydrogen peroxide may decompose spontaneously without the need for a catalyst, which can lead to an uncontrollable reaction.\n\nIn summary, increasing the temperature generally increases the reaction rate and sustainability of the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by potassium iodide, up to an optimal temperature range. Beyond this range, the reaction rate may decrease due to the denaturation of the catalyst or spontaneous decomposition of hydrogen peroxide."
