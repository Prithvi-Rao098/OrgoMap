    "message_2": "To calculate the corrosion potential of the copper electrode, we need to use the Nernst equation, which relates the reduction potential of a half-cell to its standard reduction potential, the temperature, and the concentrations of the species involved in the reaction.\n\nThe Nernst equation is:\n\nE = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\n\nwhere:\nE is the reduction potential of the half-cell\nE° is the standard reduction potential of the half-cell\nR is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\nT is the temperature in Kelvin (25°C = 298 K)\nn is the number of electrons transferred in the half-cell reaction\nF is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol)\nQ is the reaction quotient, which is the ratio of the concentrations of the products to the reactants\n\nFor the copper half-cell, the reaction is:\n\nCu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu\n\nThe standard reduction potential (E°) for this reaction is +0.34 V. The number of electrons transferred (n) is 2. The reaction quotient (Q) can be calculated as follows:\n\nQ = [Cu] / [Cu²⁺]\n\nSince the copper electrode is exposed to a solution containing 0.1 M CuSO₄, the concentration of Cu²⁺ ions is 0.1 M. The concentration of Cu metal is 1, as it is a pure solid.\n\nQ = 1 / 0.1 = 10\n\nNow we can plug these values into the Nernst equation:\n\nE = 0.34 - (8.314 * 298 / (2 * 96,485)) * ln(10)\nE = 0.34 - (0.043 / 2) * ln(10)\nE = 0.34 - 0.0215 * 2.303\nE = 0.34 - 0.0495\nE = 0.2905 V\n\nThe corrosion potential of the copper electrode exposed to a solution containing 0.1 M CuSO₄ and 1 M H₂SO₄ at a temperature of 25°C is approximately 0.2905 V."
