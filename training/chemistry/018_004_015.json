    "message_2": "To find the activation energy (Ea) of the reaction between hydrogen peroxide and iodide ions, we can use the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk = Ae^(-Ea/RT)\n\nwhere k is the rate constant, A is the pre-exponential factor, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin, and Ea is the activation energy.\n\nSince the rate of the reaction increases by a factor of 4 when the temperature is increased from 25°C to 50°C, we can set up the following equation:\n\nk2/k1 = e^((Ea/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2))\n\nwhere k1 and k2 are the rate constants at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively. \n\nGiven that k2 = 4k1, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n4 = e^((Ea/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2))\n\nFirst, we need to convert the temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin:\n\nT1 = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\nT2 = 50°C + 273.15 = 323.15 K\n\nNow, we can plug in the temperatures and the gas constant into the equation:\n\n4 = e^((Ea/8.314)(1/298.15 - 1/323.15))\n\nTo solve for Ea, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(4) = (Ea/8.314)(1/298.15 - 1/323.15)\n\nEa = 8.314 * ln(4) / (1/298.15 - 1/323.15)\n\nEa ≈ 48.7 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the activation energy of the reaction between hydrogen peroxide and iodide ions is approximately 48.7 kJ/mol."
