    "message_2": "When 1-butene (C4H8) reacts with hydrogen (H2) in the presence of a platinum catalyst, the reaction is called hydrogenation. In this reaction, the double bond in 1-butene is converted to a single bond, and two hydrogen atoms are added to the molecule. The product formed is butane (C4H10)."
