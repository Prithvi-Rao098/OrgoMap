Provide a molecular structure proposal for compound X based on the mass spectral data.\"",
    "message_2": "To identify the unknown compound X, we will analyze the given mass spectral data and propose a molecular structure based on the observed peaks.\n\n1. Molecular ion peak (M+) at m/z 112: This peak represents the molecular weight of the compound X. Therefore, the molecular formula of compound X should have a total mass of 112 atomic mass units (amu).\n\n2. Base peak at m/z 91: This is the most abundant peak in the mass spectrum, which indicates the most stable fragment ion formed after the loss of a neutral fragment from the molecular ion.\n\n3. Characteristic fragment peaks at m/z 73 and m/z 57: These peaks represent other significant fragment ions formed during the mass spectrometry process.\n\nNow, let's try to deduce the molecular structure of compound X:\n\nSince the molecular ion peak is at m/z 112, we can consider the molecular formula to be C8H8O (112 amu = 8 × 12 + 8 × 1 + 16). This formula suggests that compound X is likely an aromatic compound with an oxygen atom.\n\nThe base peak at m/z 91 suggests that the compound lost a neutral fragment with a mass of 21 amu (112 - 91). This loss could be due to the cleavage of a CH3 group and a hydrogen atom (15 + 1 + 1 = 21). This indicates that compound X might have a CH3 group attached to the aromatic ring.\n\nConsidering the fragment peaks at m/z 73 and m/z 57, we can deduce that the compound lost additional neutral fragments with masses of 39 amu (112 - 73) and 55 amu (112 - 57). These losses could be due to the cleavage of a C3H3 group (39 amu) and a C4H3O group (55 amu), respectively.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can propose the molecular structure of compound X to be 2-methylphenol (o-cresol):\n\n      OH\n       |\nC6H4 - CH3\n\nThis structure has a molecular formula of C7H8O (108 amu) and fits the given mass spectral data. The presence of an aromatic ring, a hydroxyl group, and a methyl group explains the observed fragment peaks and the base peak in the mass spectrum."
