    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant, Kc, for the given reaction, we need to use the equilibrium concentrations of the reactants and products. The general expression for Kc for this reaction is:\n\nKc = [SO3]^2 / ([SO2]^2 * [O2])\n\nAt equilibrium, the concentrations are given as [SO2] = 0.015 M, [O2] = 0.008 M, and [SO3] = 0.025 M. Plugging these values into the Kc expression, we get:\n\nKc = (0.025)^2 / ((0.015)^2 * (0.008))\n\nKc = 0.000625 / (0.000225 * 0.008)\n\nKc = 0.000625 / 0.0000018\n\nKc ≈ 347.22\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium constant, Kc, for the given reaction at 600 K is approximately 347.22."
