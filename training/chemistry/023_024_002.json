    "message_2": "The preparation of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene from nitrobenzene and chlorine gas involves an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nC6H5NO2 + 2 Cl2 â†’ C6H3Cl2NO2 + 2 HCl\n\nNitrobenzene (C6H5NO2) reacts with chlorine gas (Cl2) to form 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene (C6H3Cl2NO2) and hydrogen chloride (HCl)."
