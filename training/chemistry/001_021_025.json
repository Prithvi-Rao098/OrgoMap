    "message_2": "When 1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane undergoes an E1 reaction with methanol, the major products are 1-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexene and 3-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexene.\n\nMechanism for the reaction:\n\n1. Formation of a carbocation: The reaction begins with the ionization of the C-Br bond, leading to the formation of a secondary carbocation at the 1-position and a bromide ion.\n\n2. Rearrangement of the carbocation (optional): In this case, there is no possibility of a hydride or alkyl shift to form a more stable carbocation, so the secondary carbocation remains as it is.\n\n3. Deprotonation: Methanol, acting as a weak base, abstracts a proton from one of the adjacent carbons to the carbocation. There are two possible positions for deprotonation: either from the 2-position or the 6-position. Deprotonation from the 2-position leads to the formation of 1-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexene, while deprotonation from the 6-position leads to the formation of 3-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexene.\n\n4. Formation of the alkene: The electrons from the C-H bond that was broken in the deprotonation step form a double bond between the carbocation and the adjacent carbon, resulting in the formation of the alkene products.\n\nThe reaction occurs via an E1 mechanism because the substrate is a secondary alkyl halide, which favors the formation of a carbocation intermediate. Additionally, methanol is a weak base and a good nucleophile, which makes it more likely to participate in an E1 elimination reaction rather than an E2 reaction. In an E1 reaction, the leaving group departs first, forming a carbocation intermediate, and then the base removes a proton from an adjacent carbon to form the alkene. This is in contrast to an E2 reaction, where the base removes the proton and the leaving group departs simultaneously."
