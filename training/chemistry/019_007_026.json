    "message_2": "To calculate the reaction quotient, Q, we use the expression:\n\nQ = [Products]^coefficients / [Reactants]^coefficients\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\n2NO(g) + O2(g) ⇌ 2NO2(g)\n\nThe Q expression is:\n\nQ = [NO2]^2 / ([NO]^2 * [O2])\n\nNow, we can plug in the initial concentrations:\n\nQ = ([0.05 M]^2) / (([0.10 M]^2) * [0.15 M])\n\nQ = (0.0025) / (0.01 * 0.15)\n\nQ = 0.0025 / 0.0015\n\nQ = 1.67\n\nSo, the reaction quotient, Q, for the given reaction and initial concentrations is 1.67."
