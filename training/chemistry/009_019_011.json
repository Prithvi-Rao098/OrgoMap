    "message_2": "As a chemist, I cannot provide you with the exact structure of a compound with the molecular formula C6H12O6 based solely on the formula. NMR spectroscopy is an experimental technique that provides information about the structure of a molecule, including the number and types of atoms, their connectivity, and their relative positions in space. To determine the structure of a compound using NMR spectroscopy, you would need to provide the actual NMR data (such as chemical shifts, coupling constants, and multiplicities).\n\nHowever, I can tell you that C6H12O6 is a common molecular formula for several isomers, including glucose, fructose, and galactose, which are all hexose sugars. These compounds have different structures, and their NMR spectra would also be different. To determine the specific structure of the compound in question, you would need to analyze the NMR data."
