    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (∆G) for the combustion of methane at standard conditions, we need to use the following equation:\n\n∆G = ∆H - T∆S\n\nwhere ∆G is the change in Gibbs free energy, ∆H is the change in enthalpy, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ∆S is the change in entropy.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard enthalpy change (∆H°) and standard entropy change (∆S°) for the reaction. We can do this by using the standard enthalpies of formation and standard entropies of the reactants and products.\n\nStandard enthalpies of formation (∆Hf°) at 298 K (in kJ/mol):\nCH4(g): -74.8\nO2(g): 0 (element in its standard state)\nCO2(g): -393.5\nH2O(l): -285.8\n\nStandard entropies (S°) at 298 K (in J/mol·K):\nCH4(g): 186.3\nO2(g): 205.1\nCO2(g): 213.8\nH2O(l): 69.9\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard enthalpy change (∆H°) and standard entropy change (∆S°) for the reaction:\n\n∆H° = [1 × (-393.5) + 2 × (-285.8)] - [1 × (-74.8) + 2 × 0] = -890.9 kJ/mol\n\n∆S° = [(1 × 213.8 + 2 × 69.9) - (1 × 186.3 + 2 × 205.1)] = -164.2 J/mol·K\n\nNow, we can calculate the Gibbs free energy change (∆G) at 298 K:\n\n∆G = ∆H - T∆S = -890.9 kJ/mol - (298 K × -164.2 J/mol·K × 1 kJ/1000 J) = -802.3 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the Gibbs free energy change (∆G) for the combustion of methane at standard conditions is -802.3 kJ/mol."
