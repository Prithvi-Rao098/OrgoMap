    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the complete combustion of methane gas, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the combustion reaction:\n\nCH₄(g) + 2O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l)\n\nNext, we need to know the standard enthalpy of formation for all the compounds involved in the reaction. We are given the values for CH₄ and H₂O, but we also need the value for CO₂. The standard enthalpy of formation for CO₂ is -393.5 kJ/mol.\n\nNow, we can use Hess's Law to calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nΔH° = Σ [ΔHf°(products)] - Σ [ΔHf°(reactants)]\n\nΔH° = [1 mol CO₂ × (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 mol H₂O × (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [1 mol CH₄ × (-74.9 kJ/mol) + 2 mol O₂ × (0 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH° = (-393.5 kJ + 2 × -285.8 kJ) - (-74.9 kJ)\n\nΔH° = (-393.5 kJ - 571.6 kJ) + 74.9 kJ\n\nΔH° = -965.1 kJ + 74.9 kJ\n\nΔH° = -890.2 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the complete combustion of methane gas at 25°C and 1 atm pressure is -890.2 kJ/mol."
