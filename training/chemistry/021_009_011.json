    "message_2": "According to the molecular orbital theory, the bond order of a molecule can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nBond order = (Number of electrons in bonding orbitals - Number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\n\nFor a nitrogen molecule (N2), each nitrogen atom has 7 electrons, so there are a total of 14 electrons in the molecule. The molecular orbital configuration for N2 is:\n\n1σ², 1σ*², 2σ², 2σ*², 2π²x, 2π²y, 3σ²\n\nNow, let's count the electrons in bonding and antibonding orbitals:\n\nBonding orbitals: 1σ² (2 electrons), 2σ² (2 electrons), 2π²x (2 electrons), 2π²y (2 electrons), and 3σ² (2 electrons) = 10 electrons\nAntibonding orbitals: 1σ*² (2 electrons) and 2σ*² (2 electrons) = 4 electrons\n\nUsing the bond order formula:\n\nBond order = (10 - 4) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3\n\nSo, the bond order of the nitrogen molecule (N2) according to the molecular orbital theory is 3."
