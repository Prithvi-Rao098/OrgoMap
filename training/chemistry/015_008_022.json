    "message_2": "The selectivity of a chemical reaction refers to the preference for the formation of one product over another in a reaction involving multiple possible products. Several factors can influence the selectivity of a chemical reaction, including:\n\n1. Steric factors: The size and shape of the reactants can affect the selectivity of a reaction. Bulky groups can hinder the approach of reactants, favoring reactions that involve less sterically hindered sites.\n\n2. Electronic factors: The distribution of electron density in the reactants can influence the selectivity of a reaction. For example, electrophilic reactions are more likely to occur at sites with higher electron density, while nucleophilic reactions are more likely to occur at sites with lower electron density.\n\n3. Solvent effects: The solvent can play a crucial role in determining the selectivity of a reaction. Polar solvents can stabilize charged intermediates, while nonpolar solvents can favor reactions that involve neutral intermediates.\n\n4. Temperature and pressure: The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, can also affect the selectivity of a reaction. Higher temperatures can favor reactions with higher activation energies, while higher pressures can favor reactions that involve a decrease in volume.\n\n5. Catalysts: The presence of a catalyst can greatly influence the selectivity of a reaction by providing an alternative reaction pathway with lower activation energy.\n\nQuantum chemistry can be used to predict the selectivity of a chemical reaction by providing detailed information about the electronic structure and energetics of the reactants, intermediates, and products. Quantum chemical calculations can help identify the most stable conformations of the reactants and the transition states for different reaction pathways. By comparing the energies of these transition states, one can predict which pathway is more likely to occur and, therefore, which product is more likely to be formed.\n\nAdditionally, quantum chemistry can provide information about the electronic factors that influence the selectivity of a reaction, such as the distribution of electron density in the reactants. This information can be used to design more selective reactions by modifying the reactants or reaction conditions to favor the formation of the desired product."
