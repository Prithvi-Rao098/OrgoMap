    "message_1": "What is the purity of a sample of aspirin if its observed melting point range is 136.5-138.5째C, given the literature melting point of pure aspirin is 138-140째C?",
    "message_2": "It is difficult to determine the exact purity of a sample based solely on its melting point range. However, we can infer that the sample is impure because the observed melting point range (136.5-138.5째C) is lower than the literature melting point range of pure aspirin (138-140째C).\n\nImpurities in a sample typically cause the melting point to decrease and the melting point range to broaden. To determine the exact purity of the sample, other analytical techniques, such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or mass spectrometry, would be required."
