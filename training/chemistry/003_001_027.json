    "message_2": "The combustion of methane is an exothermic reaction, which means it releases heat. The balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane is:\n\nCH₄(g) + 2O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l)\n\nTo calculate the change in enthalpy (ΔH) for this reaction, we need to consider the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) for each of the compounds involved. The standard enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a substance is formed from its elements in their standard states.\n\nΔH = [ΔHf°(CO₂) + 2ΔHf°(H₂O)] - [ΔHf°(CH₄) + 2ΔHf°(O₂)]\n\nThe standard enthalpies of formation for the compounds are:\n\nΔHf°(CH₄) = -74.8 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(O₂) = 0 kJ/mol (since O₂ is in its standard state)\nΔHf°(CO₂) = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(H₂O) = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔH = [(-393.5) + 2(-285.8)] - [(-74.8) + 2(0)]\nΔH = (-393.5 - 571.6) - (-74.8)\nΔH = -965.1 + 74.8\nΔH = -890.3 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the change in enthalpy (ΔH) for the combustion of methane (CH₄) at standard conditions is approximately -890.3 kJ/mol."
