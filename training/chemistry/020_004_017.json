Provide a step-by-step calculation to show the effect of the catalyst on both the forward and reverse reaction rates and the resulting equilibrium concentrations of all species involved.",
    "message_2": "The reaction between nitrogen oxide (NO) and hydrogen gas (H₂) to form ammonia (NH₃) can be represented by the following balanced equation:\n\n2 NO + 3 H₂ ⇌ 2 NH₃\n\nTo analyze the effect of a catalyst on the equilibrium position of this reaction, we can use the concept of reaction rates and equilibrium constants.\n\nStep 1: Define the reaction rates and equilibrium constant\nLet's denote the forward reaction rate as kf and the reverse reaction rate as kr. The equilibrium constant (K) for the reaction is defined as:\n\nK = [NH₃]² / ([NO]² [H₂]³)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the effect of the catalyst on reaction rates\nThe addition of a catalyst will increase both the forward and reverse reaction rates by the same factor, without affecting the equilibrium constant. Let's denote this factor as F. So, the new reaction rates with the catalyst are:\n\nkf' = F * kf\nkr' = F * kr\n\nStep 3: Calculate the new equilibrium concentrations\nSince the equilibrium constant remains unchanged, the new equilibrium concentrations of all species involved can be calculated using the same K value:\n\nK = [NH₃']² / ([NO']² [H₂']³)\n\nStep 4: Compare the initial and new equilibrium concentrations\nSince the catalyst increases both the forward and reverse reaction rates by the same factor, the equilibrium position of the reaction remains unchanged. This means that the new equilibrium concentrations of all species involved ([NH₃'], [NO'], and [H₂']) will be the same as the initial equilibrium concentrations ([NH₃], [NO], and [H₂]).\n\nIn conclusion, the addition of a catalyst does not affect the equilibrium position of the reaction between nitrogen oxide and hydrogen gas to form ammonia. It only increases the forward and reverse reaction rates by the same factor, allowing the reaction to reach equilibrium faster. However, the resulting equilibrium concentrations of all species involved remain unchanged."
