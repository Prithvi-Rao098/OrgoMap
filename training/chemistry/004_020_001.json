    "message_2": "To identify the presence of carbonyl groups in a given compound using UV-Vis spectroscopy, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Prepare a sample of the compound in a suitable solvent, such as ethanol or methanol, to obtain a clear solution. The concentration should be low enough to avoid absorption saturation but high enough to provide a detectable signal.\n\n2. Record the UV-Vis absorption spectrum of the sample solution using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer. Carbonyl groups typically absorb light in the ultraviolet region, with a wavelength range of approximately 170-300 nm.\n\n3. Look for characteristic absorption peaks in the spectrum. Carbonyl groups usually exhibit a strong absorption band in the range of 170-220 nm, corresponding to the π→π* electronic transition, and a weaker band in the range of 270-300 nm, corresponding to the n→π* transition. The exact position of these bands may vary depending on the specific carbonyl-containing compound and the presence of other functional groups.\n\n4. Compare the observed absorption bands with literature values for the compound or similar compounds containing carbonyl groups. Some reliable sources for literature values include:\n\n- Standard textbooks on UV-Vis spectroscopy, such as \"Principles of Instrumental Analysis\" by Skoog, Holler, and Crouch, or \"Molecular Spectroscopy\" by Banwell and McCash.\n- Research articles and reviews on the UV-Vis spectroscopy of carbonyl compounds, which can be found in scientific journals like the Journal of Physical Chemistry, Journal of Organic Chemistry, or Spectrochimica Acta Part A.\n- Online databases like the NIST Chemistry WebBook (https://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/) or the Spectral Database for Organic Compounds (SDBS; https://sdbs.db.aist.go.jp/).\n\nBy comparing your experimental results with literature values, you can verify the presence of carbonyl groups in the compound and gain insights into its structure and properties."
