    "message_2": "To find the empirical formula of the compound, we need to convert the mass percentages to moles and then find the simplest whole number ratio of the elements.\n\n1. Convert mass percentages to grams (assuming 100g of the compound):\n- Oxygen: 63.52 g\n- Sulfur: 28.09 g\n- Hydrogen: 8.39 g\n\n2. Convert grams to moles using the molar mass of each element:\n- Oxygen: 63.52 g / 16.00 g/mol = 3.970 mol\n- Sulfur: 28.09 g / 32.07 g/mol = 0.875 mol\n- Hydrogen: 8.39 g / 1.01 g/mol = 8.307 mol\n\n3. Divide each mole value by the smallest mole value to find the mole ratio:\n- Oxygen: 3.970 / 0.875 = 4.537\n- Sulfur: 0.875 / 0.875 = 1\n- Hydrogen: 8.307 / 0.875 = 9.495\n\n4. Round the mole ratios to the nearest whole number to find the empirical formula:\n- Oxygen: 4.537 ≈ 5\n- Sulfur: 1\n- Hydrogen: 9.495 ≈ 9\n\nSo, the empirical formula of the compound is H9S1O5, or H9SO5."
