    "message_2": "The preparation of 4-bromoacetanilide from acetanilide and bromine can be carried out through electrophilic aromatic substitution. Here is a step-by-step procedure for this reaction:\n\n1. Weigh out approximately 2 grams of acetanilide and transfer it to a 250 mL round-bottom flask.\n\n2. Add 50 mL of glacial acetic acid to the flask containing acetanilide. Stir the mixture to dissolve the acetanilide completely.\n\n3. In a separate container, prepare a solution of bromine by dissolving 1.2 grams of bromine in 5 mL of glacial acetic acid.\n\n4. Slowly add the bromine solution to the acetanilide solution in the round-bottom flask, while stirring continuously. The reaction mixture will turn reddish-brown due to the formation of the bromonium ion.\n\n5. Heat the reaction mixture on a water bath at 60-70°C for about 30 minutes to ensure complete reaction.\n\n6. Cool the reaction mixture to room temperature. The product, 4-bromoacetanilide, will precipitate out as yellowish-brown crystals.\n\n7. Filter the crystals using vacuum filtration and wash them with cold water to remove any unreacted bromine and acetic acid.\n\n8. Recrystallize the product from a suitable solvent, such as ethanol or a mixture of ethanol and water, to obtain pure 4-bromoacetanilide crystals.\n\nTo determine the purity of the final product, you can use the following techniques:\n\n1. Melting point determination: Determine the melting point of the purified 4-bromoacetanilide using a melting point apparatus. Compare the observed melting point with the literature value (approximately 165-166°C). A sharp melting point close to the literature value indicates a high degree of purity.\n\n2. Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) analysis: Perform a TLC analysis of the purified 4-bromoacetanilide using an appropriate solvent system (e.g., a mixture of hexane and ethyl acetate). Spot the purified product and a reference sample of 4-bromoacetanilide on a TLC plate and develop the plate in the solvent system. Visualize the spots under UV light or by staining with an appropriate reagent (e.g., iodine). Compare the Rf values of the purified product and the reference sample. If the Rf values match and only one spot is observed for the purified product, it indicates a high degree of purity."
