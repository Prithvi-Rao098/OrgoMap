    "message_2": "The mechanism behind the nucleophilic addition reaction of an aldehyde or ketone with a nucleophile involves the following steps:\n\n1. Nucleophilic attack: The nucleophile, which is a species with a lone pair of electrons, attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde or ketone. This results in the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate. The carbonyl carbon's double bond with the oxygen atom is broken, and the oxygen atom becomes negatively charged.\n\n2. Protonation: The negatively charged oxygen atom in the tetrahedral intermediate abstracts a proton (H+) from a suitable proton donor (usually a solvent or an acid). This step results in the formation of the final product, which is an alcohol.\n\nExample:\n\nA simple example of a nucleophilic addition reaction is the reaction between an aldehyde (e.g., acetaldehyde, CH3CHO) and a nucleophile (e.g., a hydride ion, H-). The reaction can be represented as follows:\n\nCH3CHO + H- → CH3CH2O- → CH3CH2OH\n\nIn this example, the nucleophile (hydride ion) attacks the carbonyl carbon of acetaldehyde, forming a tetrahedral intermediate (CH3CH2O-). This intermediate then abstracts a proton from a suitable proton donor to form the final product, ethanol (CH3CH2OH)."
