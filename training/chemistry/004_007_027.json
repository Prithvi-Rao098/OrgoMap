    "message_2": "To find the mass of pure calcium carbonate in the sample, you can use the percentage given:\n\nMass of pure calcium carbonate = (Percentage of calcium carbonate / 100) * Total mass of the sample\n\nMass of pure calcium carbonate = (80.0 / 100) * 2.50 g\n\nMass of pure calcium carbonate = 0.8 * 2.50 g\n\nMass of pure calcium carbonate = 2.00 g\n\nSo, the mass of pure calcium carbonate in the sample is 2.00 g."
