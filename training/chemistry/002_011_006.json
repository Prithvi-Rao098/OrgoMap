    "message_2": "Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) is an inorganic molecule containing one sulfur atom and six fluorine atoms. The predicted geometry and polarity of SF6 can be determined using the VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) theory and by analyzing the electronegativity of the atoms involved.\n\n1. Geometry: SF6 has a total of 6 electron domains (6 bonding pairs) around the central sulfur atom. According to VSEPR theory, these electron domains will arrange themselves to minimize repulsion, resulting in an octahedral geometry. In an octahedral geometry, all six fluorine atoms are positioned at equal distances from the central sulfur atom, with bond angles of 90Â° between them.\n\n2. Polarity: Polarity in a molecule is determined by the difference in electronegativity between the atoms involved in the bond and the symmetry of the molecule. In the case of SF6, the electronegativity of sulfur is 2.58, and that of fluorine is 3.98. There is a significant difference in electronegativity, which would typically result in polar bonds. However, due to the octahedral geometry and the symmetry of the molecule, the individual bond dipoles cancel each other out, resulting in a nonpolar molecule.\n\nIn conclusion, sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) has an octahedral geometry and is a nonpolar molecule."
