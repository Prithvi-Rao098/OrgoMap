    "message_2": "In diamond, the type of bonding present is covalent bonding. Covalent bonding occurs when atoms share electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration, usually by filling their outermost electron shells.\n\nDiamond is an allotrope of carbon, which means it is made up of carbon atoms arranged in a specific structure. In the case of diamond, each carbon atom is bonded to four other carbon atoms in a tetrahedral arrangement. This is due to the fact that carbon has four valence electrons in its outermost shell, and it needs to form four covalent bonds to achieve a stable electron configuration with a full outer shell.\n\nThe strong covalent bonds between the carbon atoms in diamond result in a rigid, three-dimensional lattice structure. This gives diamond its exceptional hardness, high thermal conductivity, and other unique properties. The covalent bonding in diamond is also responsible for its transparency, as there are no free electrons or ions to absorb or scatter light."
