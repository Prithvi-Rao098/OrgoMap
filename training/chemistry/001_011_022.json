    "message_2": "When an excess of acetic anhydride is added to salicylic acid at room temperature and catalyzed by a small amount of sulfuric acid, the product formed is acetylsalicylic acid, commonly known as aspirin, and acetic acid as a byproduct. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nC7H6O3 (salicylic acid) + C4H6O3 (acetic anhydride) â†’ C9H8O4 (acetylsalicylic acid) + C2H4O2 (acetic acid)\n\nMechanism of the formation of the product:\n\n1. Protonation of the carbonyl group: The sulfuric acid (H2SO4) acts as a catalyst and donates a proton (H+) to the carbonyl oxygen of the acetic anhydride, making it more electrophilic.\n\n2. Nucleophilic attack: The deprotonated oxygen of the hydroxyl group (-OH) in salicylic acid acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the protonated acetic anhydride. This forms a tetrahedral intermediate.\n\n3. Loss of the leaving group: The tetrahedral intermediate collapses, and the electrons from the oxygen-carbon bond reform the carbonyl double bond (C=O). This causes the loss of the acetate ion (CH3COO-) as a leaving group.\n\n4. Proton transfer: The acetate ion abstracts a proton from the protonated oxygen of the tetrahedral intermediate, forming acetic acid as a byproduct.\n\n5. Formation of acetylsalicylic acid: The final product, acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), is formed as a result of the esterification reaction between salicylic acid and acetic anhydride.\n\nOverall, this reaction is an example of an acetylation reaction, where an acetyl group (CH3CO-) is transferred from acetic anhydride to salicylic acid, forming acetylsalicylic acid and acetic acid as a byproduct."
