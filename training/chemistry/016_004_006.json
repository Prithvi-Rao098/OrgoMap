    "message_2": "To calculate the heat required to raise the temperature of a substance, we can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat required, m is the mass of the substance, c is the heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nm = 50 g (mass of water)\nc = 4.184 J/g°C (heat capacity of water)\nΔT = 50°C - 20°C = 30°C (change in temperature)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nq = (50 g) × (4.184 J/g°C) × (30°C)\n\nq = 6276 J\n\nSo, the heat required to raise the temperature of 50 grams of water from 20°C to 50°C is 6276 Joules."
