    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise problem for the student to solve:\n\nA chemistry student conducted an experiment to synthesize a compound and obtained a theoretical yield of 50 grams. However, the actual yield obtained in the experiment was only 35 grams. Calculate the percent yield of the reaction.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the percent yield of the reaction, you can use the following formula:\n\nPercent Yield = (Actual Yield / Theoretical Yield) x 100\n\nIn this case, the actual yield is 35 grams, and the theoretical yield is 50 grams. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nPercent Yield = (35 / 50) x 100\n\nPercent Yield = 0.7 x 100\n\nPercent Yield = 70%\n\nSo, the percent yield of the reaction is 70%."
