    "message_2": "The synthesis of ibuprofen from 2-methylpropylbenzene and carbon dioxide involves a series of reactions, including Friedel-Crafts alkylation, oxidation, and carboxylation. The optimum reaction conditions for each step may vary, but generally, the following conditions can be considered for the overall process:\n\n1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation:\n- Temperature: 80-100°C\n- Pressure: Atmospheric pressure\n- Catalyst: Aluminum chloride (AlCl3) or other Lewis acids\n- Solvent: Chlorinated solvents like dichloromethane or chloroform\n- Molar ratio: 1:1 (2-methylpropylbenzene to catalyst)\n\n2. Oxidation:\n- Temperature: 100-150°C\n- Pressure: Atmospheric pressure\n- Catalyst: Potassium permanganate (KMnO4) or other strong oxidizing agents\n- Solvent: Aqueous solution with a small amount of an organic solvent (e.g., acetone)\n- Molar ratio: 1:1 (oxidizing agent to substrate)\n\n3. Carboxylation:\n- Temperature: 150-200°C\n- Pressure: 10-30 bar (CO2 pressure)\n- Catalyst: Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) or other transition metal catalysts\n- Solvent: Polar aprotic solvents like dimethylformamide (DMF) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)\n- Molar ratio: 1:1 (substrate to catalyst)\n\nThe yield and purity of the final product can be affected by various factors, such as the efficiency of each reaction step, the choice of catalysts and solvents, and the reaction conditions. To maximize the yield and purity of ibuprofen, it is essential to optimize each reaction step by carefully controlling the temperature, pressure, catalyst type and amount, and solvent type and amount. Additionally, purification steps like recrystallization, chromatography, or distillation may be necessary to obtain a high-purity final product."
