    "message_2": "In eukaryotic cells, the net ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation per glucose molecule in the Citric Acid Cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle) can be calculated by considering the number of NADH and FADH2 molecules produced and their respective ATP yields.\n\nFor each glucose molecule, one round of glycolysis, one round of pyruvate decarboxylation, and two rounds of the Citric Acid Cycle occur. Here is the breakdown of NADH and FADH2 production:\n\n1. Glycolysis: 2 NADH molecules are produced per glucose molecule.\n2. Pyruvate decarboxylation: 2 NADH molecules are produced per glucose molecule (1 per pyruvate).\n3. Citric Acid Cycle: 6 NADH and 2 FADH2 molecules are produced per glucose molecule (3 NADH and 1 FADH2 per cycle, and the cycle occurs twice).\n\nNow, let's consider the ATP yield for NADH and FADH2. In eukaryotic cells, NADH produced in the mitochondria generates approximately 2.5 ATP molecules through oxidative phosphorylation, while FADH2 generates approximately 1.5 ATP molecules. This difference in ATP yield is due to their entry points in the electron transport chain. NADH donates electrons to Complex I, while FADH2 donates electrons to Complex II. Since Complex I contributes to the proton gradient more than Complex II, NADH generates more ATP than FADH2.\n\nCalculating the net ATP production:\n\n- 10 NADH (from glycolysis, pyruvate decarboxylation, and the Citric Acid Cycle) x 2.5 ATP/NADH = 25 ATP\n- 2 FADH2 (from the Citric Acid Cycle) x 1.5 ATP/FADH2 = 3 ATP\n\nTotal net ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation per glucose molecule in the Citric Acid Cycle in eukaryotic cells is 25 + 3 = 28 ATP. However, it is important to note that the 2 NADH molecules produced in glycolysis are generated in the cytoplasm, and their transport into the mitochondria may consume additional ATP, which can slightly reduce the net ATP yield."
