    "message_1": "What is the resistance of an electrochemical cell with a copper electrode and a zinc electrode that are connected by a salt bridge, given that the concentration of copper ions is 0.1 M, the concentration of zinc ions is 0.2 M, and the cell potential is 1.08 V at 25°C? The standard reduction potentials for the Cu2+/Cu and Zn2+/Zn half-reactions are +0.34 V and -0.76 V, respectively. Assume the cell has negligible internal resistance.",
    "message_2": "To find the resistance of the electrochemical cell, we first need to determine the cell potential under non-standard conditions using the Nernst equation. The Nernst equation is given by:\n\nE = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\n\nwhere E is the cell potential under non-standard conditions, E° is the standard cell potential, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin (25°C = 298.15 K), n is the number of electrons transferred in the redox reaction, F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol), and Q is the reaction quotient.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the standard cell potential (E°) for the cell:\n\nE° = E°(cathode) - E°(anode) = E°(Cu2+/Cu) - E°(Zn2+/Zn) = 0.34 V - (-0.76 V) = 1.10 V\n\nNext, we need to find the reaction quotient (Q) for the cell:\n\nQ = [Cu2+]/[Zn2+] = (0.1 M)/(0.2 M) = 0.5\n\nNow, we can use the Nernst equation to find the cell potential under non-standard conditions (E):\n\nE = 1.10 V - (8.314 J/mol·K * 298.15 K / (2 * 96,485 C/mol)) * ln(0.5)\nE = 1.10 V - (0.0257 V) * ln(0.5)\nE = 1.10 V - (-0.0181 V)\nE = 1.1181 V\n\nSince the cell potential is given as 1.08 V, there is a discrepancy between the calculated cell potential and the given cell potential. This discrepancy could be due to the assumption of negligible internal resistance. However, the problem states that we should assume the cell has negligible internal resistance, so we cannot calculate the resistance based on the given information."
