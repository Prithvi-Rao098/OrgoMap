    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change associated with the fusion of 45.0 g of ice at 0°C, we need to first determine the number of moles of ice and then use the enthalpy of fusion for water to calculate the enthalpy change.\n\n1. Calculate the number of moles of ice:\nThe molar mass of water (H₂O) is 18.015 g/mol.\nNumber of moles = mass / molar mass\n\nn = 45.0 g / 18.015 g/mol\nn ≈ 2.50 moles of ice\n\n2. Calculate the enthalpy change:\nEnthalpy change = number of moles × enthalpy of fusion\n\nΔH = 2.50 moles × 6.01 kJ/mol\nΔH ≈ 15.03 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change associated with the fusion of 45.0 g of ice at 0°C is approximately 15.03 kJ."
