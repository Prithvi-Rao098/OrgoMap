    "message_2": "To determine the amount of copper sulfate (CuSO4) present in a 5.00 grams sample using gravimetric analysis, we need to know the percentage composition of copper sulfate in the compound.\n\n1. Calculate the molar mass of copper sulfate (CuSO4):\nCu: 63.55 g/mol\nS: 32.07 g/mol\nO: 16.00 g/mol (x 4 = 64.00 g/mol)\n\nMolar mass of CuSO4 = 63.55 + 32.07 + 64.00 = 159.62 g/mol\n\n2. Calculate the percentage composition of copper sulfate in the compound:\nLet's assume the compound contains 100% copper sulfate (since it's the only component mentioned). Therefore, the percentage composition of CuSO4 in the compound is 100%.\n\n3. Calculate the amount of copper sulfate in the 5.00 grams sample:\nAmount of CuSO4 = (Percentage composition of CuSO4 / 100) × mass of the sample\nAmount of CuSO4 = (100 / 100) × 5.00 grams = 5.00 grams\n\nSo, there are 5.00 grams of copper sulfate (CuSO4) present in the 5.00 grams sample of the compound."
