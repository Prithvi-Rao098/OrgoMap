    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium concentrations of NOBr, NO, and Br2, we can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:\n\n```\n          2NOBr(g) <=> 2NO(g) + Br2(g)\nInitial:    0.10 M      0 M        0 M\nChange:    -2x M       +2x M      +x M\nEquilibrium:0.10-2x M   2x M       x M\n```\n\nThe equilibrium constant expression for this reaction is:\n\nKc = [NO]^2[Br2] / [NOBr]^2\n\nWe can plug in the equilibrium concentrations into the expression:\n\n1.5 x 10^-5 = (2x)^2(x) / (0.10 - 2x)^2\n\nNow we need to solve for x:\n\n(1.5 x 10^-5)(0.10 - 2x)^2 = (2x)^2(x)\n\nIt's a cubic equation, which can be difficult to solve directly. However, since Kc is very small, we can assume that x is also very small, and therefore 2x is also very small compared to 0.10. So, we can approximate:\n\n(1.5 x 10^-5)(0.10)^2 = (2x)^2(x)\n\nNow we can solve for x:\n\n(1.5 x 10^-5)(0.01) = 4x^3\n1.5 x 10^-7 = 4x^3\n\nx^3 = (1.5 x 10^-7) / 4\nx^3 ≈ 3.75 x 10^-8\nx ≈ 3.36 x 10^-3\n\nNow we can find the equilibrium concentrations:\n\n[NOBr] = 0.10 - 2x ≈ 0.10 - 2(3.36 x 10^-3) ≈ 0.0933 M\n[NO] = 2x ≈ 2(3.36 x 10^-3) ≈ 6.72 x 10^-3 M\n[Br2] = x ≈ 3.36 x 10^-3 M\n\nSo, the equilibrium concentrations are approximately [NOBr] = 0.0933 M, [NO] = 6.72 x 10^-3 M, and [Br2] = 3.36 x 10^-3 M."
