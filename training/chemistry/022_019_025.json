    "message_2": "To find the reaction rate, we first need to determine the balanced chemical equation for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide:\n\n2 H2O2 (aq) → 2 H2O (l) + O2 (g)\n\nNext, we need to convert the mass of hydrogen peroxide (4 grams) into moles. The molar mass of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is:\n\n(2 × 1.008 g/mol for H) + (2 × 16.00 g/mol for O) = 34.016 g/mol\n\nNow, we can convert the mass of hydrogen peroxide into moles:\n\n4 g H2O2 × (1 mol H2O2 / 34.016 g H2O2) ≈ 0.1175 mol H2O2\n\nSince the balanced equation shows a 1:1 ratio between H2O2 and H2O, the moles of H2O produced are equal to the moles of H2O2 decomposed:\n\n0.1175 mol H2O2 → 0.1175 mol H2O\n\nNow, we can find the reaction rate by dividing the moles of H2O2 decomposed by the time it takes for the reaction to occur (120 seconds):\n\nReaction rate = (0.1175 mol H2O2) / (120 s) ≈ 0.0009792 mol H2O2/s\n\nThe reaction rate for the decomposition of 4 grams of hydrogen peroxide is approximately 0.0009792 mol/s."
