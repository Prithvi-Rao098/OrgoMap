    "message_2": "To calculate the standard molar entropy change (∆S°) for the reaction, we need to use the Gibbs free energy equation:\n\n∆G° = ∆H° - T∆S°\n\nHowever, we are not given the standard molar Gibbs free energy change (∆G°) or the temperature (T) in the problem. We need more information to solve this problem."
