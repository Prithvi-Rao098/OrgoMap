    "message_2": "To determine the oxidation state of carbon in ethanol (C2H5OH), we need to assign oxidation states to each atom in the molecule and then find the average oxidation state for the two carbon atoms.\n\nStep 1: Assign oxidation states to each atom.\n- Hydrogen (H) typically has an oxidation state of +1.\n- Oxygen (O) typically has an oxidation state of -2.\n- Carbon (C) is the atom we want to find the oxidation state for.\n\nStep 2: Write the oxidation state equation.\nLet x be the oxidation state of the first carbon atom (C1) and y be the oxidation state of the second carbon atom (C2). The sum of the oxidation states of all atoms in a neutral molecule is equal to zero. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\nC1 + 6H + C2 + O = 0\nx + 6(+1) + y + (-2) = 0\n\nStep 3: Solve the equation.\nx + 6 + y - 2 = 0\nx + y = -4\n\nStep 4: Determine the individual oxidation states of carbon atoms.\nIn ethanol, the first carbon atom (C1) is bonded to three hydrogen atoms and the second carbon atom (C2). The second carbon atom (C2) is bonded to two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. \n\nFor C1, since it is bonded to three hydrogen atoms, its oxidation state would be -3 (as each hydrogen atom contributes +1). \n\nFor C2, since it is bonded to two hydrogen atoms (+1 each) and one oxygen atom (-2), its oxidation state would be -1.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the average oxidation state of carbon in ethanol.\nNow that we have the oxidation states of both carbon atoms, we can find the average oxidation state of carbon in ethanol:\n\nAverage oxidation state = (C1 + C2) / 2\n= (-3 + (-1)) / 2\n= -4 / 2\n= -2\n\nThe oxidation state of carbon in ethanol (C2H5OH) is -2."
