    "message_2": "To determine the required amount of chlorine gas needed to prepare 10 grams of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline from aniline, we need to first write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction and then use stoichiometry to calculate the amount of chlorine gas needed.\n\nThe reaction involves two steps: nitration and chlorination. First, aniline is nitrated to form 4-nitroaniline, and then it is chlorinated to form 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline.\n\nStep 1: Nitration of aniline\nAniline (C6H7N) + HNO3 → 4-Nitroaniline (C6H6N2O2) + H2O\n\nStep 2: Chlorination of 4-nitroaniline\n4-Nitroaniline (C6H6N2O2) + Cl2 → 2-Chloro-4-nitroaniline (C6H5ClN2O2) + HCl\n\nNow, we need to find the molar mass of each compound involved in the reaction:\n\nAniline (C6H7N): (6 × 12.01) + (7 × 1.01) + 14.01 = 93.13 g/mol\n4-Nitroaniline (C6H6N2O2): (6 × 12.01) + (6 × 1.01) + (2 × 14.01) + (2 × 16.00) = 138.13 g/mol\n2-Chloro-4-nitroaniline (C6H5ClN2O2): (6 × 12.01) + (5 × 1.01) + 35.45 + (2 × 14.01) + (2 × 16.00) = 173.58 g/mol\nChlorine gas (Cl2): 2 × 35.45 = 70.90 g/mol\n\nWe are given that we need to prepare 10 grams of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline. Using stoichiometry, we can calculate the amount of chlorine gas needed:\n\n10 g 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline × (1 mol 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline / 173.58 g 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline) × (1 mol Cl2 / 1 mol 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline) × (70.90 g Cl2 / 1 mol Cl2) = 4.08 g Cl2\n\nTherefore, 4.08 grams of chlorine gas are needed to prepare 10 grams of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline from aniline."
