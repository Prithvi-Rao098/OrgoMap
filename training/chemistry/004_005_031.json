    "message_2": "To calculate the pH of a 0.1 M hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution, we can use the formula:\n\npH = -log10[H+]\n\nSince HCl is a strong acid, it will dissociate completely in water, meaning that the concentration of H+ ions will be equal to the concentration of HCl. In this case, the concentration of H+ ions is 0.1 M.\n\npH = -log10(0.1)\npH = 1.00\n\nUsing a calibrated pH meter with a sensitivity of 0.01 pH units, the pH of the 0.1 M hydrochloric acid solution at 25°C is approximately 1.00."
