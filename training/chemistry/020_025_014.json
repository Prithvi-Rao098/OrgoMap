    "message_2": "The reaction between hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and iodide ions (I-) in acidic solution can be represented by the following equation:\n\nH2O2 (aq) + 2 I- (aq) + 2 H+ (aq) â‡Œ I2 (aq) + 2 H2O (l)\n\nTo find the equilibrium constant (K) for this reaction, you would need experimental data or a reference source that provides the value. Unfortunately, I cannot perform experiments or access specific reference sources. However, I can guide you on how to use the equilibrium constant once you have it.\n\nIf you have the equilibrium constant (K), you can use it to predict the extent of the reaction and the concentrations of the species at equilibrium. The expression for the equilibrium constant for this reaction would be:\n\nK = [I2] / ([H2O2] [I-]^2 [H+]^2)\n\nWhere [I2], [H2O2], [I-], and [H+] represent the equilibrium concentrations of iodine, hydrogen peroxide, iodide ions, and hydrogen ions, respectively.\n\nYou can use this expression along with the initial concentrations of the reactants and the stoichiometry of the reaction to solve for the equilibrium concentrations and determine the extent of the reaction."
