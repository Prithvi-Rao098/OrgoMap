    "message_2": "The balanced chemical equation for the precipitation reaction between silver nitrate (AgNO3) and sodium chloride (NaCl) in aqueous solution is:\n\nAgNO3(aq) + NaCl(aq) → AgCl(s) + NaNO3(aq)\n\nTo determine the amount of solid silver chloride (AgCl) produced, we need to find the limiting reactant and then use stoichiometry.\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of each reactant:\nmoles of AgNO3 = (volume in L) × (molarity) = (100.0 mL × (1 L / 1000 mL)) × 0.200 M = 0.0200 moles\nmoles of NaCl = (volume in L) × (molarity) = (150.0 mL × (1 L / 1000 mL)) × 0.150 M = 0.0225 moles\n\nNow, we need to find the mole ratio between the reactants:\nmole ratio = moles of AgNO3 / moles of NaCl = 0.0200 / 0.0225 = 0.8889\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the balanced equation is 1:1, the reactant with the lower mole ratio is the limiting reactant. In this case, AgNO3 is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow we can use stoichiometry to find the moles of AgCl produced:\nmoles of AgCl = moles of AgNO3 (limiting reactant) × (1 mole of AgCl / 1 mole of AgNO3) = 0.0200 moles\n\nFinally, we can convert moles of AgCl to grams:\nmass of AgCl = moles of AgCl × molar mass of AgCl = 0.0200 moles × 143.32 g/mol = 2.866 g\n\nSo, 2.866 grams of solid silver chloride (AgCl) will be produced when 100.0 mL of 0.200 M silver nitrate is mixed with 150.0 mL of 0.150 M sodium chloride."
