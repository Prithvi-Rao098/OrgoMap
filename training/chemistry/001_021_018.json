    "message_2": "When 1-bromo-2-methylbutane is treated with sodium ethoxide in ethanol, the major product formed is 2-methyl-2-butene. The reaction proceeds via an E2 (bimolecular elimination) mechanism. Here's the step-by-step mechanism of the reaction:\n\n1. Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) acts as a strong base and nucleophile. The ethoxide ion (OEt-) abstracts a β-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbon bonded to the bromine) from 1-bromo-2-methylbutane.\n\n2. Simultaneously, the carbon-bromine bond breaks, and the electrons from the bond form a new π bond between the α and β carbons, creating a double bond.\n\n3. The bromide ion (Br-) and ethanol (EtOH) are released as byproducts.\n\nThe overall reaction can be represented as:\n\n1-bromo-2-methylbutane + NaOEt → 2-methyl-2-butene + NaBr + EtOH\n\nThis type of reaction is called an elimination reaction because it involves the removal of two substituents (in this case, a bromine atom and a hydrogen atom) from the reactant molecule, leading to the formation of a double bond. In an elimination reaction, a small molecule (like HBr in this case) is eliminated from the reactant, and the remaining parts of the molecule combine to form the product."
