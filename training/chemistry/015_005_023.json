    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change (∆H°) for the reaction, we need to find the difference between the bond dissociation energies of the reactants and products.\n\nReactants:\n2NH3(g): There are 2 N-H bonds in each NH3 molecule, so there are 4 N-H bonds in 2NH3. The bond dissociation energy for N-H is 391 kJ/mol, so the total energy for 2NH3 is 4 * 391 = 1564 kJ/mol.\n5O2(g): The bond dissociation energy for O=O is 495 kJ/mol, so the total energy for 5O2 is 5 * 495 = 2475 kJ/mol.\n\nTotal energy for reactants = 1564 + 2475 = 4039 kJ/mol\n\nProducts:\n4NO(g): There are 1 N=O bond in each NO molecule, so there are 4 N=O bonds in 4NO. The bond dissociation energy for N=O is 607 kJ/mol, so the total energy for 4NO is 4 * 607 = 2428 kJ/mol.\n6H2O(l): There are 2 O-H bonds in each H2O molecule, so there are 12 O-H bonds in 6H2O. The bond dissociation energy for O-H is 464 kJ/mol, so the total energy for 6H2O is 12 * 464 = 5568 kJ/mol.\n\nTotal energy for products = 2428 + 5568 = 7996 kJ/mol\n\nNow we can find the standard enthalpy change (∆H°) for the reaction:\n∆H° = Total energy for products - Total energy for reactants\n∆H° = 7996 - 4039\n∆H° = 3957 kJ/mol"
