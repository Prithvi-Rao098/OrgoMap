    "message_2": "To determine the maximum yield of aspirin, we need to use the stoichiometry of the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between salicylic acid and acetic anhydride. The balanced equation is:\n\nC7H6O3 (salicylic acid) + C4H6O3 (acetic anhydride) → C9H8O4 (aspirin) + C2H4O2 (acetic acid)\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of salicylic acid reacts with 1 mole of acetic anhydride to produce 1 mole of aspirin.\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of salicylic acid:\n\nMoles = mass (g) / molar mass (g/mol)\n\nThe molar mass of salicylic acid (C7H6O3) = (7 × 12.01) + (6 × 1.01) + (3 × 16.00) = 138.12 g/mol\n\nMoles of salicylic acid = 5 g / 138.12 g/mol = 0.0362 mol\n\nNow, we can find the moles of aspirin produced:\n\nMoles of aspirin = moles of salicylic acid = 0.0362 mol\n\nNext, we need to find the mass of aspirin produced:\n\nMass (g) = moles × molar mass (g/mol)\n\nThe molar mass of aspirin (C9H8O4) = (9 × 12.01) + (8 × 1.01) + (4 × 16.00) = 180.16 g/mol\n\nMass of aspirin = 0.0362 mol × 180.16 g/mol = 6.52 g\n\nTherefore, the maximum yield of aspirin that can be produced from 5 grams of salicylic acid and an excess amount of acetic anhydride is 6.52 grams."
