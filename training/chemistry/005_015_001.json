    "message_2": "The complete oxidation of one glucose molecule through glycolysis, the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle), and oxidative phosphorylation generates approximately 30 to 32 ATP molecules. \n\nHere is the breakdown of ATP production in each stage:\n\n1. Glycolysis: 2 ATP (net gain) and 2 NADH molecules are produced.\n2. Pyruvate decarboxylation: 2 NADH molecules are produced (1 per pyruvate).\n3. Citric acid cycle: 6 NADH, 2 FADH2, and 2 ATP molecules are produced per glucose molecule.\n\nNow, considering the oxidative phosphorylation, each NADH molecule generates approximately 2.5 ATP, and each FADH2 molecule generates approximately 1.5 ATP through the electron transport chain.\n\nSo, the total ATP production is:\n- Glycolysis: 2 ATP\n- Oxidative phosphorylation from NADH (10 NADH x 2.5 ATP): 25 ATP\n- Oxidative phosphorylation from FADH2 (2 FADH2 x 1.5 ATP): 3 ATP\n- Citric acid cycle: 2 ATP\n\nTotal ATP: 2 + 25 + 3 + 2 = 32 ATP\n\nHowever, in some cells and conditions, the number of ATP molecules generated can be closer to 30 due to variations in the efficiency of the electron transport chain and the transport of NADH into the mitochondria."
