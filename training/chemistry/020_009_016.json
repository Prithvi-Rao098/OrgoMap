    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction, we first need to determine the change in concentrations of the reactants and products at equilibrium. We are given the initial concentrations and the equilibrium concentration of NH3.\n\nInitial concentrations:\n[N2] = 0.03 M\n[H2] = 0.09 M\n[NH3] = 0 M\n\nEquilibrium concentration of NH3:\n[NH3] = 0.045 M\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is N2 + 3H2 ⇌ 2NH3, we can determine the change in concentrations of N2 and H2 using the stoichiometric coefficients.\n\nΔ[NH3] = 0.045 M - 0 M = 0.045 M\nΔ[N2] = - (1/2) * Δ[NH3] = - (1/2) * 0.045 M = -0.0225 M\nΔ[H2] = - (3/2) * Δ[NH3] = - (3/2) * 0.045 M = -0.0675 M\n\nNow, we can find the equilibrium concentrations of N2 and H2:\n\n[N2]_eq = [N2]_initial + Δ[N2] = 0.03 M - 0.0225 M = 0.0075 M\n[H2]_eq = [H2]_initial + Δ[H2] = 0.09 M - 0.0675 M = 0.0225 M\n\nNow we can calculate the equilibrium constant (Kc) using the equilibrium concentrations:\n\nKc = [NH3]^2 / ([N2] * [H2]^3) = (0.045)^2 / (0.0075 * (0.0225)^3) = 1.1025 / 0.000038306 = 28.76\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction is approximately 28.76."
