    "message_2": "To calculate the new equilibrium constant when the temperature is increased by 20 °C, we can use the van't Hoff equation:\n\nln(K2/K1) = -ΔH/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere K1 and K2 are the equilibrium constants at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively, ΔH is the enthalpy change for the reaction, and R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the enthalpy change from kJ/mol to J/mol:\n\nΔH = -90.6 kJ/mol * 1000 J/kJ = -90600 J/mol\n\nNext, we need to find the initial temperature (T1) in Kelvin. Since we don't have the initial temperature, we can't find the exact value of K2. However, we can express the relationship between K1 and K2 as a function of the temperature change:\n\nLet T1 = T (in Kelvin)\nT2 = T + 20 °C = T + 20 K (since the difference in temperature remains the same in Celsius and Kelvin)\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the van't Hoff equation:\n\nln(K2/5.6 x 10^-3) = -(-90600 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K) * (1/(T + 20) - 1/T)\n\nTo solve for K2, we can first isolate it:\n\nK2 = 5.6 x 10^-3 * exp[-(-90600 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K) * (1/(T + 20) - 1/T)]\n\nSince we don't have the initial temperature (T), we cannot find the exact value of K2. However, we have expressed the relationship between K1 and K2 as a function of the temperature change."
