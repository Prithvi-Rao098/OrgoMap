    "message_2": "The bond order of a nitrogen molecule (N2) can be determined using molecular orbital theory by calculating the difference between the number of electrons in bonding and antibonding orbitals, divided by 2.\n\nFor N2, each nitrogen atom has 7 electrons, so there are a total of 14 electrons in the molecule. The molecular orbitals are filled in the following order: σ1s, σ*1s, σ2s, σ*2s, π2p, σ2p, and π*2p.\n\nFilling the orbitals with 14 electrons, we have:\n\n- 2 electrons in σ1s (bonding)\n- 2 electrons in σ*1s (antibonding)\n- 2 electrons in σ2s (bonding)\n- 2 electrons in σ*2s (antibonding)\n- 4 electrons in π2p (bonding)\n- 2 electrons in σ2p (bonding)\n\nThere are no electrons in the π*2p orbital.\n\nNow, we can calculate the bond order:\n\nBond order = (Number of electrons in bonding orbitals - Number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\nBond order = (10 - 4) / 2\nBond order = 6 / 2\nBond order = 3\n\nSo, the bond order of a nitrogen molecule (N2) is 3. This means there is a triple bond between the two nitrogen atoms."
