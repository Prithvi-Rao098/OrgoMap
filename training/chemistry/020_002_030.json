    "message_1": "What are the equilibrium concentrations of reactants and products when 1 mole of hydrogen gas (H2) and 1 mole of iodine gas (I2) are placed in a sealed container and allowed to react to form hydrogen iodide (HI) gas at a temperature of 450°C? The equilibrium constant for the reaction is 54.3 at this temperature.",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium concentrations of the reactants and products, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nH2(g) + I2(g) ⇌ 2HI(g)\n\nNext, we'll set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to keep track of the moles of each species:\n\n          H2    I2    HI\nInitial   1     1     0\nChange   -x    -x    +2x\nEquilibrium 1-x  1-x   2x\n\nAt equilibrium, the reaction quotient (Q) is equal to the equilibrium constant (K):\n\nK = [HI]^2 / ([H2] * [I2])\n\nSince we need to find the equilibrium concentrations, we'll assume the volume of the container is V:\n\nK = (2x)^2 / ((1-x)(1-x))\n\nNow, we can plug in the given value for K (54.3) and solve for x:\n\n54.3 = (2x)^2 / ((1-x)(1-x))\n\nRearrange and solve for x:\n\n(2x)^2 = 54.3 * (1-x)^2\n\nAfter solving for x, we get:\n\nx ≈ 0.957\n\nNow, we can find the equilibrium concentrations of each species:\n\n[H2] = 1 - x = 1 - 0.957 ≈ 0.043 M\n[I2] = 1 - x = 1 - 0.957 ≈ 0.043 M\n[HI] = 2x = 2 * 0.957 ≈ 1.914 M\n\nSo, the equilibrium concentrations are approximately 0.043 M for H2, 0.043 M for I2, and 1.914 M for HI."
