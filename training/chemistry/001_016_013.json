    "message_2": "The acid-catalyzed hydration of propene to form 2-propanol involves three main steps: protonation of the alkene, nucleophilic attack by water, and deprotonation. Here is the detailed mechanism:\n\n1. Protonation of the alkene:\nIn the presence of a strong acid catalyst (e.g., H2SO4 or H3O+), the alkene (propene) reacts with the acid to form a carbocation intermediate. The acid donates a proton (H+) to the double bond, which breaks and forms a bond with the proton. This results in the formation of a more stable carbocation intermediate, which is the 2-propyl carbocation.\n\nPropene + H+ → 2-propyl carbocation\n\n2. Nucleophilic attack by water:\nThe carbocation intermediate formed in the previous step is an electrophile, meaning it is electron-deficient and can accept electron pairs. Water, which is a nucleophile, donates an electron pair to the carbocation, forming a bond with the carbocation's positively charged carbon atom. This results in the formation of an oxonium ion intermediate.\n\n2-propyl carbocation + H2O → 2-propyl oxonium ion\n\n3. Deprotonation:\nThe oxonium ion intermediate formed in the previous step is unstable due to the positive charge on the oxygen atom. A nearby water molecule acts as a base and abstracts a proton from the oxonium ion, resulting in the formation of 2-propanol and regenerating the acid catalyst.\n\n2-propyl oxonium ion + H2O → 2-propanol + H+\n\nOverall, the acid-catalyzed hydration of propene to form 2-propanol involves the protonation of the alkene, nucleophilic attack by water, and deprotonation, with the acid catalyst playing a crucial role in both the protonation and deprotonation steps."
