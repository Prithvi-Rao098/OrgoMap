    "message_2": "To find the value of the reaction quotient Qc for the given equilibrium reaction, we can use the formula:\n\nQc = [Products] / [Reactants]\n\nFor the reaction 2H2(g) + O2(g) ⇌ 2H2O(g), the Qc expression is:\n\nQc = [H2O]^2 / ([H2]^2 * [O2])\n\nNow, we can plug in the given concentrations:\n\nQc = (0.20)^2 / ((0.10)^2 * (0.05))\n\nQc = 0.04 / (0.01 * 0.05)\n\nQc = 0.04 / 0.0005\n\nQc = 80\n\nSo, the value of the reaction quotient Qc for this equilibrium reaction is 80."
