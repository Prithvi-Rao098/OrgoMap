    "message_2": "To calculate the heat of mixing, we first need to determine the amount of heat released during the neutralization reaction between HCl and NaOH. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nHCl + NaOH → NaCl + H2O\n\nThe limiting reactant in this reaction is NaOH, as it has a lower concentration (0.1 M) compared to HCl (0.2 M). \n\nFirst, let's find the moles of NaOH and HCl:\n\nMoles of NaOH = Volume (L) × Concentration (M)\nMoles of NaOH = 0.1 L × 0.1 M = 0.01 moles\n\nMoles of HCl = Volume (L) × Concentration (M)\nMoles of HCl = 0.1 L × 0.2 M = 0.02 moles\n\nSince NaOH is the limiting reactant, the moles of HCl that will react with NaOH are equal to the moles of NaOH:\n\nMoles of HCl that react = 0.01 moles\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat released during the reaction. The heat of neutralization for a strong acid and strong base is approximately -57.3 kJ/mol. \n\nHeat released = Moles of limiting reactant × Heat of neutralization\nHeat released = 0.01 moles × -57.3 kJ/mol = -0.573 kJ\n\nNow, we need to calculate the temperature change of the solution. The total volume of the solution is 200 mL, and since the density is 1 g/mL, the mass of the solution is 200 g. \n\nWe can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nWhere q is the heat released, m is the mass of the solution, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the temperature change. We can rearrange the formula to solve for ΔT:\n\nΔT = q / (mc)\n\nΔT = -0.573 kJ / (200 g × 4.18 J/g℃)\nΔT = -573 J / (836 J/℃)\nΔT = -0.685 ℃\n\nSince the heat of mixing is the heat released during the reaction, the heat of mixing is -0.573 kJ."
