    "message_2": "The standard enthalpy change for the phase transition of solid ice to liquid water can be calculated using the heat of fusion of ice. The heat of fusion is the amount of energy required to change 1 mole of a substance from the solid phase to the liquid phase at constant temperature and pressure.\n\nGiven:\nHeat of fusion of ice = 6.01 kJ/mol\nMolar heat capacity of water = 75.3 J/mol·K\n\nTo calculate the standard enthalpy change for the phase transition, we can use the heat of fusion value directly, as it represents the energy required for the phase transition:\n\nStandard enthalpy change = Heat of fusion of ice\nStandard enthalpy change = 6.01 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the phase transition of solid ice to liquid water is 6.01 kJ/mol."
