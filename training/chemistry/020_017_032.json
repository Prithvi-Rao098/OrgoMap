    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (K) for the reaction, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nAg+ (aq) + 2NH3 (aq) ⇌ Ag(NH3)2+ (aq)\n\nNow, we can use the equilibrium concentrations given to find the equilibrium constant. The equilibrium constant expression for this reaction is:\n\nK = [Ag(NH3)2+] / ([Ag+] * [NH3]^2)\n\nWe are given the equilibrium concentrations of Ag+ and NH3:\n\n[Ag+] = 0.040 M\n[NH3] = 0.10 M\n\nWe are not given the equilibrium concentration of Ag(NH3)2+, but we can find it using stoichiometry. For every mole of Ag+ that reacts, one mole of Ag(NH3)2+ is formed. Therefore, the change in concentration of Ag+ is equal to the change in concentration of Ag(NH3)2+.\n\nInitial concentration of Ag(NH3)2+ = 0 M\nChange in concentration of Ag+ = -0.040 M\nChange in concentration of Ag(NH3)2+ = +0.040 M\nEquilibrium concentration of Ag(NH3)2+ = 0.040 M\n\nNow we can plug these equilibrium concentrations into the K expression:\n\nK = [0.040] / ([0.040] * [0.10]^2)\nK = 0.040 / (0.040 * 0.01)\nK = 0.040 / 0.0004\nK = 100\n\nThe equilibrium constant (K) for the reaction between silver ion (Ag+) and ammonia (NH3) to form the complex ion silver-ammonia (Ag(NH3)2+) at a temperature of 25°C is 100."
