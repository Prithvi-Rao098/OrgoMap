Given the following reactions and their respective enthalpy changes: \n1) N2 (g) + 3H2 (g) → 2NH3 (g), ΔH₁ = − 92.4 kJ/mol \n2) N2 (g) + O2 (g) → 2NO (g), ΔH₂ = +180.6 kJ/mol \n3) 2NO (g) + O2 (g) → 2NO2 (g), ΔH₃ = − 112.0 kJ/mol",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Hess's Law, we need to manipulate the given reactions in such a way that when they are added together, the resulting reaction is the one we are interested in: the formation of 2 moles of ammonia from nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas. \n\nThe first reaction is already the one we want to find the enthalpy change for, so we don't need to manipulate it:\n\n1) N2 (g) + 3H2 (g) → 2NH3 (g), ΔH₁ = − 92.4 kJ/mol\n\nThe second and third reactions need to be manipulated to cancel out the unwanted species (NO, NO2, and O2). We can achieve this by reversing the second reaction and adding it to the third reaction:\n\nReversed 2) 2NO (g) → N2 (g) + O2 (g), ΔH₂' = -180.6 kJ/mol\n3) 2NO (g) + O2 (g) → 2NO2 (g), ΔH₃ = − 112.0 kJ/mol\n\nNow, add the reversed second reaction and the third reaction:\n\n4) 2NO2 (g) → N2 (g) + 2O2 (g), ΔH₄ = ΔH₂' + ΔH₃ = -180.6 kJ/mol - 112.0 kJ/mol = -292.6 kJ/mol\n\nNow we have the following reactions:\n\n1) N2 (g) + 3H2 (g) → 2NH3 (g), ΔH₁ = − 92.4 kJ/mol\n4) 2NO2 (g) → N2 (g) + 2O2 (g), ΔH₄ = -292.6 kJ/mol\n\nSince the first reaction is already the one we want to find the enthalpy change for, we don't need to add or subtract any other reactions. The enthalpy change for the formation of 2 moles of ammonia from nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas is:\n\nΔH = ΔH₁ = -92.4 kJ/mol"
