    "message_2": "To find the density of NaCl at 25°C, we can use the formula:\n\nDensity = (mass of one unit cell) / (volume of one unit cell)\n\nFirst, we need to find the mass of one unit cell. Since NaCl has a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure, there are four NaCl formula units per unit cell. The molecular weight of NaCl is 58.44 g/mol, so the mass of one unit cell is:\n\nMass of one unit cell = (4 formula units/cell) × (58.44 g/mol) / (Avogadro's number)\n\nNext, we need to find the volume of one unit cell. The edge length of the unit cell is given as 5.640 Å (1 Å = 1 x 10^-10 m). The volume of a cube is given by the formula:\n\nVolume = a³\n\nwhere a is the edge length. So, the volume of one unit cell is:\n\nVolume of one unit cell = (5.640 x 10^-10 m)³ = 1.790 x 10^-28 m³\n\nNow we can find the density:\n\nDensity = (mass of one unit cell) / (volume of one unit cell)\n\nDensity = [(4 × 58.44 g/mol) / (Avogadro's number)] / (1.790 x 10^-28 m³)\n\nDensity = [(4 × 58.44 g/mol) / (6.022 x 10^23 mol⁻¹)] / (1.790 x 10^-28 m³)\n\nDensity = (233.76 g/mol) / (6.022 x 10^23 mol⁻¹) / (1.790 x 10^-28 m³)\n\nDensity = 3.88 x 10^-25 g/m³\n\nSo, the density of NaCl at 25°C is approximately 3.88 x 10^-25 g/m³."
