    "message_1": "Calculate the standard enthalpy change for the vaporization of water at its normal boiling point of 100 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 1 atm. The molar enthalpy of vaporization for water is 40.7 kJ/mol. What is the amount of heat required to vaporize 100 g of water?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat required to vaporize 100 g of water, we can use the molar enthalpy of vaporization and the molar mass of water.\n\nFirst, let's convert the mass of water to moles:\nMolar mass of water (H2O) = 18.015 g/mol\n100 g of water / 18.015 g/mol = 5.55 moles of water\n\nNow, we can use the molar enthalpy of vaporization to calculate the heat required:\nMolar enthalpy of vaporization = 40.7 kJ/mol\nHeat required = moles of water * molar enthalpy of vaporization\nHeat required = 5.55 moles * 40.7 kJ/mol = 225.885 kJ\n\nTherefore, the amount of heat required to vaporize 100 g of water is approximately 225.9 kJ."
