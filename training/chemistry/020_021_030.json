    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (K) for the redox reaction between Fe2+ and MnO4- in acidic medium, we first need to balance the redox reaction and find the overall cell potential (E°cell).\n\nBalancing the redox reaction:\n\nFe2+ → Fe(s) + 2e- (×5)\nMnO4- + 8H+ + 5e- → Mn2+ + 4H2O (×2)\n\nAdding the two balanced half-reactions:\n\n5Fe2+ + 2MnO4- + 16H+ → 5Fe(s) + 2Mn2+ + 8H2O\n\nNow, we can find the overall cell potential (E°cell) by subtracting the reduction potential of the anode (Fe2+ to Fe) from the reduction potential of the cathode (MnO4- to Mn2+):\n\nE°cell = E°cathode - E°anode\nE°cell = 1.51V - (-0.44V)\nE°cell = 1.95V\n\nNow, we can use the Nernst equation to find the equilibrium constant (K):\n\nΔG° = -nFE°cell\n\nWhere ΔG° is the standard Gibbs free energy change, n is the number of electrons transferred (in this case, 10), F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol), and E°cell is the overall cell potential.\n\nAt equilibrium, ΔG° = -RTlnK, where R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K) and T is the temperature in Kelvin (25°C = 298K).\n\nCombining the two equations:\n\n-RTlnK = -nFE°cell\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK = e^((nFE°cell)/(RT))\n\nK = e^((10 * 96485 * 1.95)/(8.314 * 298))\n\nK ≈ 1.14 × 10^45\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant for the redox reaction between Fe2+ and MnO4- in acidic medium at 25°C is approximately 1.14 × 10^45."
