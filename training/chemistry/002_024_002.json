    "message_2": "When FeCl3 (Iron(III) chloride) is dissolved in water, it forms a yellow-colored solution. This is due to the presence of Fe3+ ions in the solution.\n\nWhen a few drops of NaOH (sodium hydroxide) solution are added to the FeCl3 solution, a reaction occurs between Fe3+ ions and OH- ions from NaOH. This reaction forms a reddish-brown precipitate of Fe(OH)3 (Iron(III) hydroxide).\n\nFe3+ (aq) + 3OH- (aq) â†’ Fe(OH)3 (s)\n\nSo, upon adding NaOH to the FeCl3 solution, the color changes from yellow to reddish-brown due to the formation of Fe(OH)3 precipitate."
