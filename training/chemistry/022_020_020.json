    "message_1": "What is the activation energy required for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen at 25°C, given the rate constant of the reaction is 0.005 s⁻¹?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the activation energy (Ea) for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, we need to use the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk = A * exp(-Ea / (R * T))\n\nwhere:\nk = rate constant (0.005 s⁻¹)\nA = pre-exponential factor (also called the frequency factor)\nEa = activation energy (which we want to find)\nR = gas constant (8.314 J/(mol*K))\nT = temperature in Kelvin (25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K)\n\nHowever, we don't have the value of the pre-exponential factor (A) for this reaction. In order to find the activation energy, we would need either the value of A or another rate constant at a different temperature to compare.\n\nIf you can provide either of these additional pieces of information, we can proceed to calculate the activation energy."
