    "message_2": "To determine the hybridization of the central atom in XeF6, we need to first find out the number of valence electrons on the central atom (Xenon) and the number of atoms bonded to it.\n\nXenon (Xe) is a noble gas and has 8 valence electrons. It forms 6 bonds with 6 fluorine (F) atoms in XeF6. In addition to these 6 bonds, there is also one lone pair of electrons on the central atom.\n\nNow, we can use the formula to find the hybridization:\n\nHybridization = 1/2 (Number of valence electrons on central atom + Number of atoms bonded to central atom + Charge on the central atom)\n\nFor XeF6:\n\nHybridization = 1/2 (8 + 6 + 0)\nHybridization = 1/2 (14)\nHybridization = 7\n\nSince the hybridization value is 7, the hybridization of the central atom (Xe) in XeF6 is sp3d3."
