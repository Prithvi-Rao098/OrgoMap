    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change of combustion for the reaction of 0.5 moles of methane, we need to know the balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane and the standard enthalpy change of combustion for methane.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane is:\n\nCH₄(g) + 2O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l)\n\nThe standard enthalpy change of combustion for methane, ΔHc°, is -890.3 kJ/mol.\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of 0.5 moles of methane:\n\nΔH = (moles of methane) × (ΔHc° for methane)\nΔH = (0.5 mol) × (-890.3 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH = -445.15 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change of combustion for the reaction of 0.5 moles of methane at standard conditions is -445.15 kJ."
