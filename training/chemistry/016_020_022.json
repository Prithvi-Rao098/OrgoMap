    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of desorption of hydrogen gas (H2) from a platinum surface, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH_desorption = -ΔH_adsorption\n\nGiven that the adsorption enthalpy of H2 on Pt is -43,300 J/mol, the enthalpy of desorption can be calculated as follows:\n\nΔH_desorption = -(-43,300 J/mol)\nΔH_desorption = 43,300 J/mol\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy of desorption of hydrogen gas (H2) from a platinum surface is 43,300 J/mol."
