    "message_2": "To find the Faraday constant, we first need to determine the number of moles of NaCl consumed and the total charge passed through the solution.\n\n1. Calculate the moles of NaCl consumed:\nNaCl has a molar mass of 58.44 g/mol (22.99 g/mol for Na and 35.45 g/mol for Cl). \n\nmoles of NaCl = mass of NaCl / molar mass of NaCl\nmoles of NaCl = 0.20 g / 58.44 g/mol = 0.00342 mol\n\n2. Determine the total charge passed through the solution:\nCurrent (I) = 2.0 A (Ampere is equal to Coulombs per second)\nTime (t) = 30 minutes = 1800 seconds (1 minute = 60 seconds)\n\nTotal charge (Q) = Current (I) × Time (t)\nQ = 2.0 A × 1800 s = 3600 C (Coulombs)\n\n3. Calculate the number of electrons transferred:\nThe balanced equation for the electrolysis of NaCl is:\n\n2 NaCl → 2 Na + Cl₂\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 2 moles of electrons are required to electrolyze 1 mole of NaCl. Therefore, the number of moles of electrons transferred is:\n\nmoles of electrons = 2 × moles of NaCl\nmoles of electrons = 2 × 0.00342 mol = 0.00684 mol\n\n4. Determine the value of the Faraday constant (F):\nThe Faraday constant is the charge of 1 mole of electrons. We can find it by dividing the total charge passed through the solution by the moles of electrons transferred:\n\nFaraday constant (F) = Total charge (Q) / moles of electrons\nF = 3600 C / 0.00684 mol = 526315.79 C/mol\n\nThe value of the Faraday constant is approximately 526,316 C/mol."
