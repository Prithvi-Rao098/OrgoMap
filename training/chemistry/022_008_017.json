    "message_2": "In a single replacement reaction, iron (Fe) will replace copper (Cu) in the copper sulfate (CuSO₄) solution, forming iron sulfate (FeSO₄) and copper (Cu) as products. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nFe (s) + CuSO₄ (aq) → FeSO₄ (aq) + Cu (s)\n\nThe products formed are iron sulfate (FeSO₄) in aqueous solution and solid copper (Cu)."
