    "message_1": "A chemistry student needs to determine the effect of increasing temperature on the equilibrium position of a chemical reaction in which an exothermic reaction is taking place. Given the balanced chemical equation A + B ⇌ C + heat, the student needs to determine how the concentration of products and reactants will change as the temperature is increased, and explain the observed changes using Le Chatelier's principle.",
    "message_2": "When the temperature of a system at equilibrium is increased, Le Chatelier's principle states that the equilibrium will shift in the direction that absorbs the added heat. In this case, the balanced chemical equation is:\n\nA + B ⇌ C + heat\n\nSince the reaction is exothermic, heat is released when the reaction proceeds in the forward direction (from reactants A and B to product C). Therefore, when the temperature is increased, the equilibrium will shift in the direction that absorbs the added heat, which is the reverse direction (from product C to reactants A and B).\n\nAs a result, the concentration of the reactants A and B will increase, while the concentration of the product C will decrease. This shift in equilibrium will continue until a new equilibrium position is established at the higher temperature.\n\nIn summary, increasing the temperature of an exothermic reaction will cause the equilibrium to shift towards the reactants, resulting in an increase in the concentration of reactants A and B and a decrease in the concentration of product C. This observation can be explained using Le Chatelier's principle, which states that a system at equilibrium will adjust to minimize the effect of any changes in temperature."
