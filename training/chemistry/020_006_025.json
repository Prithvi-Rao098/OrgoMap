    "message_1": "If the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction CO(g) + H2O(g) ⇌ CO2(g) + H2(g) is 4.56 at 450°C, what will be the new value of Kc if the temperature is increased to 550°C?",
    "message_2": "To determine the new value of Kc at 550°C, we need to know the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the reaction and use the van't Hoff equation:\n\nln(K2/K1) = -ΔH/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere K1 is the equilibrium constant at T1 (450°C), K2 is the equilibrium constant at T2 (550°C), ΔH is the enthalpy change of the reaction, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), and T1 and T2 are the initial and final temperatures in Kelvin.\n\nHowever, the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the reaction is not provided. Without this information, we cannot calculate the new value of Kc at 550°C."
