    "message_2": "The half-life of Carbon-14 (C-14) is approximately 5,730 years. This means that after 5,730 years, half of the initial amount of C-14 in a sample will have decayed into Nitrogen-14 (N-14). \n\nCarbon-14 is a radioactive isotope of carbon that is formed in the upper atmosphere when cosmic rays interact with nitrogen atoms. It is then incorporated into carbon dioxide, which is taken up by plants during photosynthesis. Animals, in turn, consume these plants, and thus C-14 is integrated into their bodies as well. As long as an organism is alive, it maintains a constant ratio of C-14 to the stable isotope Carbon-12 (C-12) in its body. However, when the organism dies, it stops taking in carbon, and the C-14 in its body begins to decay into N-14 at a known rate.\n\nTo determine the age of ancient organic materials, scientists measure the ratio of C-14 to C-12 in the sample and compare it to the ratio found in the atmosphere. By calculating the difference between the two ratios, they can determine how many half-lives have passed since the organism's death. Using the half-life of C-14 (5,730 years), they can then estimate the age of the sample.\n\nThis method, known as radiocarbon dating, is widely used in archaeology and other fields to date organic materials such as fossils, bones, wood, and textiles up to around 50,000 years old."
