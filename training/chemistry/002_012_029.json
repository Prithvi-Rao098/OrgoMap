    "message_2": "The bond order of a molecule can be determined by the number of bonding electrons minus the number of antibonding electrons, divided by 2. For carbon monoxide (CO), the electronic configuration is:\n\nC: 1s² 2s² 2p²\nO: 1s² 2s² 2p⁴\n\nWhen these two atoms form a bond, their atomic orbitals overlap to create molecular orbitals. In the case of CO, the molecular orbitals can be represented as follows:\n\nσ(1s)², σ*(1s)², σ(2s)², σ*(2s)², π(2p)⁴, σ(2p)²\n\nNow, let's calculate the bond order:\n\nBond order = (Number of bonding electrons - Number of antibonding electrons) / 2\nBond order = (10 - 4) / 2\nBond order = 6 / 2\nBond order = 3\n\nThe bond order of CO is 3, which indicates a triple bond between the carbon and oxygen atoms.\n\nAs for the bond length, it is inversely proportional to the bond order. In general, a higher bond order results in a shorter bond length. The experimental bond length of CO is approximately 1.128 Å (angstroms)."
