    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic moment of the [Fe(H2O)6]3+ complex, we first need to find the number of unpaired electrons in the Fe3+ ion.\n\nThe electron configuration of Fe (iron) is [Ar] 3d^6 4s^2. When it forms the Fe3+ ion, it loses 3 electrons, 2 from the 4s orbital and 1 from the 3d orbital. The electron configuration of Fe3+ is [Ar] 3d^5.\n\nNow, we can use the spin-only formula to calculate the magnetic moment (µ):\n\nµ = √(n(n+2)) µB\n\nwhere n is the number of unpaired electrons and µB is the Bohr magneton (approximately 9.27 x 10^-24 Am²).\n\nIn the case of Fe3+ with 5 unpaired electrons:\n\nµ = √(5(5+2)) µB\nµ = √(5(7)) µB\nµ = √35 µB\n\nThe magnetic moment of the [Fe(H2O)6]3+ complex is approximately √35 µB (around 5.92 µB)."
