    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of methane gas in a bomb calorimeter, we need to know the balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane and the standard enthalpies of formation for each compound involved in the reaction.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane is:\nCH₄(g) + 2O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l)\n\nNow, we need the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) for each compound involved in the reaction. These values are typically found in a reference book or online database. The values are:\n\nΔHf°(CH₄) = -74.8 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(O₂) = 0 kJ/mol (since O₂ is an element in its standard state)\nΔHf°(CO₂) = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(H₂O) = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nUsing Hess's Law, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction (ΔHrxn) as follows:\n\nΔHrxn = [ΔHf°(products) - ΔHf°(reactants)]\n\nΔHrxn = [1 * (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 * (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [1 * (-74.8 kJ/mol) + 2 * 0 kJ/mol]\n\nΔHrxn = (-393.5 - 571.6) - (-74.8)\n\nΔHrxn = -965.1 + 74.8\n\nΔHrxn = -890.3 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the enthalpy change for the combustion of methane gas in a bomb calorimeter is approximately -890.3 kJ/mol."
