    "message_2": "To calculate the heat released when 10.0 g of solid NaOH is dissolved in 200.0 mL of water, we will first determine the number of moles of NaOH and then use the heat of crystallization to find the heat released.\n\n1. Calculate the number of moles of NaOH:\nThe molar mass of NaOH is 22.99 g/mol (Na) + 15.999 g/mol (O) + 1.007 g/mol (H) = 39.996 g/mol.\nNumber of moles = mass / molar mass\nNumber of moles = 10.0 g / 39.996 g/mol = 0.250 mol\n\n2. Calculate the heat released using the heat of crystallization:\nHeat released = number of moles × heat of crystallization\nHeat released = 0.250 mol × 44.5 kJ/mol = 11.125 kJ\n\nTherefore, the heat released when 10.0 g of solid NaOH is dissolved in 200.0 mL of water is 11.125 kJ."
