    "message_2": "The standard enthalpy of formation of carbon dioxide (CO2) can be determined using the given information about the standard enthalpy of combustion of carbon (C) and hydrogen gas (H2). \n\nThe combustion reaction for carbon is:\nC (s) + O2 (g) → CO2 (g)\n\nThe combustion reaction for hydrogen is:\nH2 (g) + 1/2 O2 (g) → H2O (l)\n\nHowever, we need to find the standard enthalpy of formation of CO2, which is the reaction:\nC (s) + O2 (g) → CO2 (g)\n\nSince the combustion reaction of carbon is the same as the formation reaction of CO2, the standard enthalpy of formation of CO2 is equal to the standard enthalpy of combustion of carbon.\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy of formation of CO2 is -394 kJ/mol."
