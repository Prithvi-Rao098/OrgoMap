The specific heat capacity of water is 4.18 J/g·°C and the heat capacity of the calorimeter is negligible. The enthalpy of solution for sodium acetate trihydrate is -16.9 kJ/mol.",
    "message_2": "To find the heat of crystallization for 100 grams of sodium acetate trihydrate, we first need to determine the number of moles of sodium acetate trihydrate in 100 grams.\n\nThe molar mass of sodium acetate trihydrate (NaC2H3O2.3H2O) is:\nNa: 22.99 g/mol\nC: 12.01 g/mol (x2)\nH: 1.01 g/mol (x3 + x6)\nO: 16.00 g/mol (x2 + x3)\n\nMolar mass = 22.99 + (2 × 12.01) + (3 × 1.01) + (6 × 1.01) + (2 × 16.00) + (3 × 16.00) = 136.08 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the number of moles in 100 grams:\nmoles = mass / molar mass = 100 g / 136.08 g/mol ≈ 0.735 moles\n\nSince the enthalpy of solution for sodium acetate trihydrate is -16.9 kJ/mol, the heat of crystallization (which is the opposite process) will be +16.9 kJ/mol.\n\nNow, we can find the heat of crystallization for 0.735 moles of sodium acetate trihydrate:\nHeat of crystallization = moles × enthalpy of crystallization = 0.735 moles × 16.9 kJ/mol ≈ 12.42 kJ\n\nTherefore, the heat of crystallization for 100 grams of sodium acetate trihydrate when it is dissolved in water and then allowed to crystallize back into solid form at a constant temperature of 25°C is approximately 12.42 kJ."
