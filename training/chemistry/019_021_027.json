    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction, we need to know the standard enthalpies of formation for the reactants and products involved in the reaction. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\n2 C (s) + O2 (g) → 2 CO (g)\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) for elemental carbon (C) in its standard state (graphite) is 0 kJ/mol, and for elemental oxygen (O2) in its standard state (gas) is also 0 kJ/mol. The standard enthalpy of formation for carbon monoxide (CO) is -110.5 kJ/mol.\n\nUsing Hess's Law, we can calculate the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the reaction:\n\nΔH° = [Σ (ΔHf° of products) - Σ (ΔHf° of reactants)]\n\nΔH° = [2 × (-110.5 kJ/mol) - (2 × 0 kJ/mol + 1 × 0 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH° = -221 kJ\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change for the reaction of 2 moles of carbon with 1 mole of oxygen to form carbon monoxide at standard conditions is -221 kJ."
