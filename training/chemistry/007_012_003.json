    "message_2": "To modify the chemical structure of an existing cancer drug to specifically target only cancer cells without harming healthy cells, we can use a targeted drug delivery system. This can be achieved by conjugating the drug with a targeting moiety, such as an antibody or a small molecule, that selectively binds to a specific receptor or biomarker overexpressed on cancer cells. Here are a few strategies to achieve this:\n\n1. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs): ADCs are composed of a monoclonal antibody linked to a cytotoxic drug. The antibody selectively binds to a specific antigen overexpressed on cancer cells, allowing for targeted delivery of the drug. Once bound, the ADC is internalized by the cancer cell, and the cytotoxic drug is released, killing the cancer cell while minimizing damage to healthy cells.\n\n2. Small molecule targeting: Small molecules can be designed to selectively bind to specific proteins or enzymes that are overexpressed in cancer cells. By conjugating the small molecule to the cancer drug, the drug can be selectively delivered to cancer cells with minimal impact on healthy cells.\n\n3. Peptide-based targeting: Peptides can be designed to selectively bind to specific cell surface receptors or other biomarkers that are overexpressed in cancer cells. By conjugating the peptide to the cancer drug, the drug can be selectively delivered to cancer cells with minimal impact on healthy cells.\n\n4. Nanoparticle-based drug delivery: Nanoparticles can be engineered to encapsulate the cancer drug and selectively target cancer cells through the use of targeting ligands on their surface. These ligands can be antibodies, peptides, or small molecules that specifically bind to receptors or biomarkers overexpressed on cancer cells. Once bound, the nanoparticle is internalized by the cancer cell, and the drug is released, killing the cancer cell while minimizing damage to healthy cells.\n\n5. Prodrug strategies: Prodrugs are inactive forms of a drug that are converted into their active form by specific enzymes or conditions present in the tumor microenvironment. By designing a prodrug that is selectively activated in cancer cells, the drug can be targeted to cancer cells while minimizing damage to healthy cells.\n\nIn conclusion, modifying the chemical structure of an existing cancer drug to specifically target cancer cells can be achieved through various strategies, including antibody-drug conjugates, small molecule targeting, peptide-based targeting, nanoparticle-based drug delivery, and prodrug strategies. These approaches aim to improve the selectivity and efficacy of cancer drugs while minimizing harm to healthy cells."
