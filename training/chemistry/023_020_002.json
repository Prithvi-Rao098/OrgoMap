    "message_2": "The balanced chemical equation for the preparation of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid from benzoic acid and chlorine gas is:\n\nC7H6O2 + 2 Cl2 → C7H4Cl2O2\n\nTo calculate the theoretical yield, we first need to determine the molar mass of benzoic acid (C7H6O2) and 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid (C7H4Cl2O2).\n\nMolar mass of benzoic acid (C7H6O2) = (7 × 12.01) + (6 × 1.01) + (2 × 16.00) = 122.12 g/mol\nMolar mass of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid (C7H4Cl2O2) = (7 × 12.01) + (4 × 1.01) + (2 × 35.45) + (2 × 16.00) = 191.02 g/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the moles of benzoic acid used:\n\nmoles of benzoic acid = mass / molar mass = 10 g / 122.12 g/mol = 0.0819 mol\n\nSince the reaction has a 1:1 stoichiometry, the moles of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid produced will be the same as the moles of benzoic acid used:\n\nmoles of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid = 0.0819 mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the theoretical mass of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid produced:\n\nmass of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid = moles × molar mass = 0.0819 mol × 191.02 g/mol = 15.64 g\n\nFinally, we can calculate the actual yield, assuming a 90% yield:\n\nactual yield = theoretical yield × percentage yield = 15.64 g × 0.90 = 14.08 g\n\nSo, the theoretical yield of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid is 14.08 grams, assuming a 90% yield."
