    "message_1": "What is the new pH value of a buffer solution consisting of 0.1 M acetic acid (Ka=1.8x10^-5) and 0.1 M sodium acetate after addition of 0.01 mol of hydrochloric acid? (Assuming the volume of solution is constant and the dissociation of water can be neglected)",
    "message_2": "To find the new pH value of the buffer solution after the addition of 0.01 mol of hydrochloric acid, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n\nwhere pH is the pH of the solution, pKa is the negative logarithm of the acid dissociation constant (Ka), [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base, and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid.\n\nFirst, we need to find the pKa value:\n\npKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.8x10^-5) ≈ 4.74\n\nNext, we need to determine the new concentrations of acetic acid and acetate after the addition of 0.01 mol of HCl. Since HCl reacts with the acetate ion (the conjugate base), the concentration of acetate will decrease by 0.01 mol, and the concentration of acetic acid will increase by 0.01 mol.\n\nNew [A-] (acetate) = 0.1 M - 0.01 mol = 0.09 M\nNew [HA] (acetic acid) = 0.1 M + 0.01 mol = 0.11 M\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = 4.74 + log(0.09/0.11) ≈ 4.74 - 0.1 = 4.64\n\nSo, the new pH value of the buffer solution after the addition of 0.01 mol of hydrochloric acid is approximately 4.64."
