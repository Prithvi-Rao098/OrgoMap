    "message_2": "The bond order of a nitrogen molecule (N2) can be determined by examining its molecular orbital diagram and using the formula:\n\nBond order = (number of electrons in bonding orbitals - number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\n\nFor N2, there are 10 valence electrons (5 from each nitrogen atom). In the molecular orbital diagram, these electrons fill the following orbitals:\n\n- 2 electrons in the σ1s bonding orbital\n- 2 electrons in the σ*1s antibonding orbital\n- 2 electrons in the σ2s bonding orbital\n- 2 electrons in the σ*2s antibonding orbital\n- 2 electrons in the π2p bonding orbitals (one in each of the two degenerate orbitals)\n\nNow, we can calculate the bond order:\n\nBond order = (2 + 2 + 2 - 2 - 2) / 2 = 1\n\nTherefore, the bond order of a nitrogen molecule (N2) is 1. However, this answer is incorrect. The correct bond order of N2 is 3, which can be determined by considering the molecular orbital diagram for N2 and filling the orbitals correctly:\n\n- 2 electrons in the σ1s bonding orbital\n- 2 electrons in the σ*1s antibonding orbital\n- 2 electrons in the σ2s bonding orbital\n- 2 electrons in the σ*2s antibonding orbital\n- 4 electrons in the π2p bonding orbitals (two in each of the two degenerate orbitals)\n- 0 electrons in the σ2p antibonding orbital\n\nNow, we can calculate the bond order:\n\nBond order = (2 + 2 + 4 - 2 - 2) / 2 = 3\n\nSo, the correct bond order of a nitrogen molecule (N2) is 3."
