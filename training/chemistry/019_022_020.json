    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction between 1 mol of ethanoic acid and 1 mol of sodium hydroxide in aqueous solution, we need to use the following formula:\n\nΔH_reaction = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH_f is the standard enthalpy of formation for each compound.\n\nThe reaction is as follows:\n\nCH3COOH (aq) + NaOH (aq) → CH3COONa (aq) + H2O (l)\n\nWe need the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔH_f) for each compound:\n\nΔH_f (CH3COOH) = -484.5 kJ/mol\nΔH_f (NaOH) = -425.6 kJ/mol\nΔH_f (CH3COONa) = -379.2 kJ/mol\nΔH_f (H2O) = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nΔH_reaction = [(-379.2) + (-285.8)] - [(-484.5) + (-425.6)]\nΔH_reaction = (-664.0) - (-910.1)\nΔH_reaction = 246.1 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the reaction between 1 mol of ethanoic acid and 1 mol of sodium hydroxide in aqueous solution is 246.1 kJ/mol (exothermic, since the value is positive)."
