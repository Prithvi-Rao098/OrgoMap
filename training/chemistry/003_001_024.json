    "message_2": "To calculate the change in enthalpy (ΔH) for the reaction, we can use the formula:\n\nΔH = Σ ΔHf(products) - Σ ΔHf(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔHf represents the enthalpy of formation for each substance.\n\nFor the given reaction, the reactants are CH4 (g) and 2O2 (g), and the products are CO2 (g) and 2H2O (l).\n\nΔHf(CH4) = -74.81 kJ/mol\nΔHf(CO2) = -393.51 kJ/mol\nΔHf(H2O) = -285.83 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nΔH = [1 × (-393.51 kJ/mol) + 2 × (-285.83 kJ/mol)] - [1 × (-74.81 kJ/mol) + 2 × 0 kJ/mol]\n\nNote that the enthalpy of formation for O2 (g) is 0 kJ/mol because it is in its standard state.\n\nΔH = (-393.51 - 2 × 285.83 + 74.81) kJ/mol\nΔH = (-393.51 - 571.66 + 74.81) kJ/mol\nΔH = -890.36 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the change in enthalpy for the reaction is -890.36 kJ/mol."
