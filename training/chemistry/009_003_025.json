    "message_1": "What is the energy released when a uranium-235 nucleus undergoes nuclear fission into two smaller nuclei, given that the mass of uranium-235 before fission is 235.043923 amu and the masses of the two smaller nuclei after fission are 140.913555 amu and 93.129455 amu? Assume that the difference in masses is completely converted to energy according to Einstein's famous equation E = mc^2.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the energy released during the nuclear fission of uranium-235, we first need to find the difference in mass before and after the fission. \n\nMass before fission (uranium-235) = 235.043923 amu\nMass after fission (two smaller nuclei) = 140.913555 amu + 93.129455 amu = 234.043010 amu\n\nDifference in mass (Δm) = Mass before fission - Mass after fission\nΔm = 235.043923 amu - 234.043010 amu = 1.000913 amu\n\nNow, we need to convert the mass difference from atomic mass units (amu) to kilograms (kg). The conversion factor is 1 amu = 1.66054 x 10^-27 kg.\n\nΔm = 1.000913 amu × (1.66054 x 10^-27 kg/amu) = 1.66246 x 10^-27 kg\n\nNow, we can use Einstein's equation E = mc^2 to calculate the energy released. The speed of light (c) is approximately 3.00 x 10^8 m/s.\n\nE = (1.66246 x 10^-27 kg) × (3.00 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nE = 1.66246 x 10^-27 kg × 9.00 x 10^16 m^2/s^2\nE = 1.496214 x 10^-10 kg m^2/s^2\n\nThe energy released is 1.496214 x 10^-10 Joules."
