    "message_2": "To develop novel antiviral drugs that are effective against viral infections such as COVID-19 while minimizing harmful side effects to human cells, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Target identification: Identify specific viral proteins or enzymes that are essential for the virus's replication and survival. These targets should be unique to the virus and not found in human cells to minimize side effects. For COVID-19, potential targets include the viral spike protein, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), proteases, and other viral proteins involved in the replication process.\n\n2. Structure-based drug design: Utilize the crystal structures of the identified viral targets to design small molecules or biologics that can specifically bind to and inhibit the function of these targets. Computational methods, such as molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations, can be employed to predict the binding affinity and stability of the designed molecules.\n\n3. Hit identification and optimization: Screen large compound libraries or design focused libraries based on the target's structure to identify potential hit compounds. These hits can be further optimized through medicinal chemistry techniques, such as structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies, to improve their potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic properties.\n\n4. In vitro and in vivo testing: Evaluate the optimized compounds for their antiviral activity in cell-based assays and animal models. This step helps to determine the efficacy of the compounds against the virus and their potential toxicity to human cells.\n\n5. Lead optimization and preclinical studies: Further optimize the lead compounds based on the results from in vitro and in vivo testing. Conduct preclinical studies, including ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) and toxicity studies, to assess the safety and pharmacokinetic properties of the lead compounds.\n\n6. Clinical trials: If the lead compounds show promising results in preclinical studies, they can be advanced to clinical trials. These trials involve testing the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the antiviral drugs in human subjects, starting with a small group of healthy volunteers and progressing to larger groups of patients with the viral infection.\n\n7. Regulatory approval and post-marketing surveillance: If the clinical trials demonstrate that the antiviral drug is safe and effective, it can be submitted for regulatory approval. Once approved, the drug can be marketed for the treatment of the specific viral infection. Post-marketing surveillance is essential to monitor the drug's safety and efficacy in real-world settings and to identify any rare or long-term side effects.\n\nBy following these steps and focusing on the unique aspects of the virus, medicinal chemistry can contribute to the development of novel antiviral drugs with minimal side effects to human cells."
