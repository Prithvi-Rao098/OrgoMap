    "message_1": "A gas phase reaction occurs according to the following equation: \n\nA(g) + 2B(g) -> C(g) + D(g)\n\nThe reaction is carried out at a total pressure of 2 atm and at 298 K. The initial concentrations of A and B are 0.1 M and 0.2 M, respectively. The rate of formation of C is measured to be 0.02 M/s. What is the rate of disappearance of B?",
    "message_2": "To find the rate of disappearance of B, we need to consider the stoichiometry of the reaction. According to the balanced equation, 1 mole of A reacts with 2 moles of B to form 1 mole of C and 1 mole of D. \n\nThe rate of formation of C is given as 0.02 M/s. Since the stoichiometry of the reaction shows that 1 mole of C is formed for every 2 moles of B consumed, we can set up a proportion to find the rate of disappearance of B:\n\nRate of formation of C / Rate of disappearance of B = Moles of C formed / Moles of B consumed\n\n0.02 M/s / Rate of disappearance of B = 1 / 2\n\nNow, we can solve for the rate of disappearance of B:\n\nRate of disappearance of B = 0.02 M/s * 2 = 0.04 M/s\n\nSo, the rate of disappearance of B is 0.04 M/s."
