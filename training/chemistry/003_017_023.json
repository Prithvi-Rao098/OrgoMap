    "message_2": "The properties of supramolecular systems are highly sensitive to changes in temperature due to the non-covalent interactions that hold them together. These interactions include hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, π-π stacking, and electrostatic interactions. As temperature changes, the properties of supramolecular systems can be affected in several ways:\n\n1. Stability: As temperature increases, the thermal energy can overcome the non-covalent interactions holding the supramolecular system together, leading to its dissociation or disruption. Conversely, lowering the temperature can stabilize the system by reducing the thermal energy and making it harder for the non-covalent interactions to be disrupted.\n\n2. Association/dissociation equilibria: The equilibrium between the associated and dissociated states of a supramolecular system can be shifted by changes in temperature. Increasing the temperature generally favors dissociation, while decreasing the temperature favors association.\n\n3. Solubility: The solubility of supramolecular systems can be affected by temperature changes. In some cases, increasing the temperature can increase solubility, while in others, it can lead to precipitation or aggregation of the supramolecular system. This can be due to changes in the balance of solvation forces and non-covalent interactions at different temperatures.\n\n4. Conformational changes: Changes in temperature can induce conformational changes in the components of a supramolecular system, which can in turn affect the overall structure and properties of the system. For example, temperature-induced changes in the conformation of a polymer chain can lead to changes in the size and shape of a supramolecular assembly formed by the polymer.\n\n5. Kinetics: The rates of association and dissociation processes in supramolecular systems are often temperature-dependent. Generally, increasing the temperature leads to faster association and dissociation rates, while decreasing the temperature slows down these processes.\n\n6. Responsiveness: Some supramolecular systems are designed to respond to changes in temperature by undergoing reversible structural or functional changes. These temperature-responsive systems can be used as sensors, actuators, or switches in various applications.\n\nIn summary, changes in temperature can significantly affect the properties of supramolecular systems, including their stability, equilibria, solubility, conformation, kinetics, and responsiveness. Understanding and controlling these temperature-dependent properties is crucial for the design and application of supramolecular systems in various fields, such as materials science, drug delivery, and sensing."
