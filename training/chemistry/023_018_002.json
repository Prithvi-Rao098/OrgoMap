    "message_2": "The step-by-step procedure for preparing 2,4-dinitrophenol from phenol and nitric acid is as follows:\n\n1. In a round-bottom flask, add a solution of phenol. Phenol can be dissolved in a suitable solvent, such as glacial acetic acid or concentrated sulfuric acid, to facilitate the reaction.\n\n2. Cool the flask in an ice bath to maintain a low temperature throughout the reaction. This is important to control the reaction rate and minimize the formation of undesired byproducts.\n\n3. Slowly add a mixture of concentrated nitric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid to the flask. The sulfuric acid acts as a catalyst and dehydrating agent, promoting the nitration of phenol. The addition should be done dropwise with constant stirring to ensure proper mixing and control the reaction rate.\n\n4. Continue stirring the mixture for a few hours to ensure complete nitration of phenol. The reaction time may vary depending on the specific conditions and reactant concentrations.\n\n5. After the reaction is complete, carefully pour the mixture into a large volume of cold water or ice to quench the reaction and precipitate the 2,4-dinitrophenol product.\n\n6. Filter the precipitated solid using vacuum filtration or another suitable method to separate the 2,4-dinitrophenol from the reaction mixture.\n\n7. Wash the solid product with water to remove any remaining acid and impurities.\n\n8. Dry the 2,4-dinitrophenol product under vacuum or in an oven at a low temperature.\n\nProperties of 2,4-dinitrophenol:\n\n- Yellow crystalline solid\n- Soluble in water, alcohol, and ether\n- Melting point: 112-114Â°C\n- Strong acidic properties due to the presence of nitro groups\n\nUses of 2,4-dinitrophenol in chemistry and industry:\n\n1. Chemical synthesis: 2,4-dinitrophenol is used as an intermediate in the synthesis of various organic compounds, such as dyes, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals.\n\n2. Dyes: It is used in the production of dyes, such as picric acid (2,4,6-trinitrophenol), which is used as a yellow dye and an explosive.\n\n3. Wood preservation: 2,4-dinitrophenol has been used as a wood preservative due to its fungicidal properties.\n\n4. Biochemical research: It is used as an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria, which helps researchers study the process of energy production in cells.\n\nNote: The use of 2,4-dinitrophenol has been restricted in many countries due to its toxic and hazardous nature. It is essential to follow proper safety precautions and regulations when handling and using this compound."
