    "message_2": "2,3-dichlorobutane has two chiral centers, which are carbons 2 and 3. To determine the number of stereoisomers, we can use the formula 2^n, where n is the number of chiral centers. In this case, n = 2, so there are 2^2 = 4 possible stereoisomers.\n\nHere are the structures of the four stereoisomers, with the configuration of each stereocenter indicated:\n\n1. (2R,3R)-2,3-dichlorobutane\n   H H Cl\n    | |  |\nH3C-C-C-C-CH3\n    | |  |\n   Cl H H\n\n2. (2R,3S)-2,3-dichlorobutane (meso compound)\n   H H Cl\n    | |  |\nH3C-C-C-C-CH3\n    | |  |\n   H Cl H\n\n3. (2S,3S)-2,3-dichlorobutane\n   H Cl H\n    | |  |\nH3C-C-C-C-CH3\n    | |  |\n   Cl H H\n\n4. (2S,3R)-2,3-dichlorobutane (meso compound)\n   H Cl H\n    | |  |\nH3C-C-C-C-CH3\n    | |  |\n   H H Cl\n\nNote that two of these stereoisomers, (2R,3S)-2,3-dichlorobutane and (2S,3R)-2,3-dichlorobutane, are meso compounds, which means they have an internal plane of symmetry and are optically inactive. The other two stereoisomers, (2R,3R)-2,3-dichlorobutane and (2S,3S)-2,3-dichlorobutane, are enantiomers and are optically active."
