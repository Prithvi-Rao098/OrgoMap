    "message_1": "A chemistry student needs to determine the effect of adding NaCl to a solution containing AgNO3 at equilibrium. The original solution had concentration [Ag+]=0.01M and [NO3-]=0.01M, and Ksp=1.8x10^-10. How much NaCl (in grams) is needed to be added to the solution in order to decrease the [Ag+] concentration by a factor of 10?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the solubility product constant (Ksp) expression for the reaction between AgNO3 and NaCl, which is:\n\nAgNO3 (aq) + NaCl (aq) â‡Œ AgCl (s) + NaNO3 (aq)\n\nThe Ksp expression for the formation of AgCl is:\n\nKsp = [Ag+] [Cl-]\n\nWe are given the initial concentration of Ag+ and NO3- ions, as well as the Ksp value for AgCl. We want to find out how much NaCl is needed to decrease the [Ag+] concentration by a factor of 10, which means the new [Ag+] will be 0.001 M.\n\nFirst, we need to find the initial concentration of Cl- ions in the solution. Since there is no NaCl initially, [Cl-] = 0 M.\n\nNow, let's denote the amount of NaCl added as 'x' moles. When NaCl is added to the solution, it will dissociate completely into Na+ and Cl- ions. So, the new concentration of Cl- ions will be x moles.\n\nAt the new equilibrium, the Ksp expression will be:\n\nKsp = (0.001) (x)\n\nWe can now plug in the given Ksp value:\n\n1.8 x 10^-10 = (0.001) (x)\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 1.8 x 10^-10 / 0.001\nx = 1.8 x 10^-7 moles\n\nNow that we have the moles of NaCl needed, we can convert it to grams using the molar mass of NaCl (58.44 g/mol):\n\nmass of NaCl = (1.8 x 10^-7 moles) (58.44 g/mol)\nmass of NaCl = 1.05192 x 10^-5 g\n\nSo, approximately 1.05 x 10^-5 grams of NaCl is needed to be added to the solution in order to decrease the [Ag+] concentration by a factor of 10."
