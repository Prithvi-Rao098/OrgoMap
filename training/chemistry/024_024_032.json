    "message_2": "Designing a system for the production of strawberry flavor involves several steps, including the selection of appropriate raw materials, extraction and purification processes, and quality control measures. Here is a step-by-step guide to designing such a system:\n\n1. Raw materials selection: Choose natural sources of strawberry flavor, such as fresh strawberries or strawberry juice concentrate. Alternatively, you can use a combination of natural and synthetic flavor compounds that mimic the taste and aroma of strawberries, such as ethyl methylphenylglycidate (also known as \"strawberry aldehyde\") and other esters, alcohols, and aldehydes. Ensure that all raw materials are food-grade and comply with food industry regulations.\n\n2. Extraction process: If using fresh strawberries or juice concentrate, employ an extraction method to isolate the flavor compounds. Common extraction techniques include steam distillation, solvent extraction, and cold pressing. Choose a method that preserves the integrity of the flavor compounds and minimizes the risk of contamination or degradation.\n\n3. Purification and concentration: After extraction, purify the flavor compounds to remove any impurities or unwanted substances. This may involve techniques such as filtration, centrifugation, or chromatography. Concentrate the purified flavor compounds to achieve the desired intensity and consistency.\n\n4. Blending and formulation: Combine the purified and concentrated flavor compounds with other ingredients, such as sweeteners, stabilizers, and emulsifiers, to create a well-balanced and stable strawberry flavor product. Ensure that all ingredients are food-grade and comply with food industry regulations.\n\n5. Quality control: Implement strict quality control measures throughout the production process to ensure that the final product is free of toxic impurities and meets food industry standards. This may involve regular testing of raw materials, in-process samples, and finished products for contaminants, such as pesticides, heavy metals, and microbial pathogens.\n\n6. Packaging and storage: Package the strawberry flavor product in appropriate food-grade containers that protect it from light, heat, and moisture. Store the product under controlled temperature and humidity conditions to maintain its quality and shelf life.\n\n7. Compliance with regulations: Ensure that the entire production process, from raw materials selection to packaging and labeling, complies with relevant food industry regulations, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) guidelines.\n\nBy following these steps, you can design a system for the production of strawberry flavor that is free of toxic impurities and complies with food industry regulations."
