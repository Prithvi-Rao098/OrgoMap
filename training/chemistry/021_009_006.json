    "message_2": "The bond order of a molecule can be determined using its molecular orbital diagram. The bond order is calculated as the difference between the number of electrons in bonding orbitals and the number of electrons in antibonding orbitals, divided by 2.\n\nFor a nitrogen molecule (N2):\nNitrogen has 7 electrons, so N2 has a total of 14 electrons. In the molecular orbital diagram, the electrons fill the following orbitals: σ1s², σ*1s², σ2s², σ*2s², π2p^4. The bond order for N2 is calculated as follows:\n\nBond order = (number of electrons in bonding orbitals - number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\nBond order = (10 - 4) / 2\nBond order = 6 / 2\nBond order = 3\n\nFor an oxygen molecule (O2):\nOxygen has 8 electrons, so O2 has a total of 16 electrons. In the molecular orbital diagram, the electrons fill the following orbitals: σ1s², σ*1s², σ2s², σ*2s², π2p^4, π*2p². The bond order for O2 is calculated as follows:\n\nBond order = (number of electrons in bonding orbitals - number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\nBond order = (12 - 4) / 2\nBond order = 8 / 2\nBond order = 4\n\nThe bond order of N2 is 3, and the bond order of O2 is 2.\n\nIn general, a higher bond order corresponds to a stronger bond and a shorter bond length. In this case, the triple bond in N2 (bond order of 3) is stronger and shorter than the double bond in O2 (bond order of 2)."
