    "message_2": "To determine the theoretical yield of benzocaine, we need to first find the limiting reagent in the reaction. We will do this by calculating the moles of each reactant and comparing their mole ratios.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the synthesis of benzocaine is:\n\np-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) + ethanol (EtOH) â†’ benzocaine + water (H2O)\n\nMolar masses:\nPABA: 137.14 g/mol (C7H7NO2)\nEtOH: 46.07 g/mol (C2H5OH)\nBenzocaine: 165.19 g/mol (C9H11NO2)\n\n1. Calculate the moles of each reactant:\nmoles of PABA = (10 g) / (137.14 g/mol) = 0.0729 mol\nmoles of EtOH = (15 mL) * (0.789 g/mL) / (46.07 g/mol) = 0.257 mol\n(The density of ethanol is 0.789 g/mL)\n\n2. Determine the limiting reagent:\nThe stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, so we can compare the moles directly.\nSince there are fewer moles of PABA (0.0729 mol) than EtOH (0.257 mol), PABA is the limiting reagent.\n\n3. Calculate the theoretical yield of benzocaine:\nmoles of benzocaine = moles of PABA = 0.0729 mol\nmass of benzocaine = (0.0729 mol) * (165.19 g/mol) = 12.03 g\n\n4. Calculate the actual yield considering 80% yield:\nactual yield = (0.80) * (12.03 g) = 9.62 g\n\nThe theoretical yield of benzocaine, considering an 80% yield, is 9.62 grams."
