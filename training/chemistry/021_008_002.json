    "message_2": "Nitrobenzene (C6H5NO2) has a benzene ring with a nitro group (-NO2) attached to it. The resonance structures of nitrobenzene can be represented as follows:\n\n1. The first resonance structure has the benzene ring with alternating single and double bonds, and the nitro group is attached to one of the carbon atoms. The nitrogen atom in the nitro group has a double bond with one oxygen atom and a single bond with the other oxygen atom, which carries a negative charge. The nitrogen atom has a positive charge.\n\n2. The second resonance structure is similar to the first one, but the double bond in the nitro group shifts to the other oxygen atom. The oxygen atom that previously had a double bond now has a single bond and a negative charge, while the other oxygen atom loses its negative charge.\n\nThese two resonance structures are in equilibrium with each other, and the actual structure of nitrobenzene is a hybrid of these two structures. The benzene ring also has its own resonance structures, with the double bonds shifting positions around the ring. However, the focus here is on the nitro group's resonance structures."
