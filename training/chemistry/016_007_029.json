    "message_2": "The given information is not sufficient to directly calculate the standard enthalpy of formation of sodium chloride (NaCl). The standard enthalpy of formation of sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl2) are not relevant to the formation of NaCl.\n\nTo determine the standard enthalpy of formation of NaCl, you would need the following information:\n\n1. The standard enthalpy of sublimation of sodium (Na) to form gaseous sodium atoms (Na(g)).\n2. The bond dissociation energy of chlorine (Cl2) to form gaseous chlorine atoms (Cl(g)).\n3. The standard enthalpy of formation of NaCl from gaseous sodium and chlorine atoms (Na(g) + Cl(g) â†’ NaCl).\n\nOnce you have this information, you can add the enthalpies together to find the standard enthalpy of formation of NaCl."
