    "message_2": "Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is a powerful analytical technique used to identify various functional groups in organic compounds by analyzing the absorption of infrared radiation by the molecules. When a molecule absorbs infrared radiation, it causes the bonds within the molecule to vibrate at specific frequencies, which are characteristic of the functional groups present in the compound.\n\nSome common functional groups that can be identified using IR spectroscopy include:\n\n1. Hydroxyl group (OH) - found in alcohols and carboxylic acids\n2. Carbonyl group (C=O) - found in aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, and esters\n3. Amine group (NH2, NH, N) - found in primary, secondary, and tertiary amines\n4. Nitrile group (C≡N) - found in nitriles\n5. Alkene group (C=C) - found in alkenes\n6. Alkyne group (C≡C) - found in alkynes\n7. Aromatic ring (C=C) - found in aromatic compounds\n\nExample of an IR spectrum:\n\nSuppose we have an IR spectrum of an unknown compound with the following significant absorption bands:\n\n1. 3300 cm⁻¹ (broad and strong)\n2. 1710 cm⁻¹ (sharp and strong)\n3. 1050 cm⁻¹ (medium)\n\nTo identify the functional groups present in the compound, we can analyze these absorption bands:\n\n1. The broad and strong absorption at 3300 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the hydroxyl group (OH) found in alcohols and carboxylic acids.\n2. The sharp and strong absorption at 1710 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O) found in aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, and esters.\n3. The medium absorption at 1050 cm⁻¹ can be attributed to the C-O single bond, which is present in alcohols, carboxylic acids, and esters.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the compound contains both a hydroxyl group (OH) and a carbonyl group (C=O), along with a C-O single bond. This suggests that the compound is likely a carboxylic acid, as carboxylic acids contain both hydroxyl and carbonyl functional groups."
