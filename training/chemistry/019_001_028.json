    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of methane, we can use the following formula:\n\nΔH_combustion = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH_combustion is the enthalpy change for the combustion, ΔH_f(products) is the sum of the enthalpies of formation of the products, and ΔH_f(reactants) is the sum of the enthalpies of formation of the reactants.\n\nFrom the balanced chemical equation, we have:\n\n1 mol of CH4(g) (methane) and 2 mol of O2(g) (oxygen) as reactants.\n1 mol of CO2(g) (carbon dioxide) and 2 mol of H2O(g) (water) as products.\n\nUsing the given enthalpies of formation:\n\nΔH_f(CH4) = -74.8 kJ/mol\nΔH_f(CO2) = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔH_f(H2O) = -241.8 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion:\n\nΔH_combustion = [1 × ΔH_f(CO2) + 2 × ΔH_f(H2O)] - [1 × ΔH_f(CH4) + 2 × ΔH_f(O2)]\n\nSince the enthalpy of formation for an element in its standard state is zero, ΔH_f(O2) = 0 kJ/mol.\n\nΔH_combustion = [1 × (-393.5) + 2 × (-241.8)] - [1 × (-74.8) + 2 × 0]\n\nΔH_combustion = (-393.5 - 483.6) - (-74.8)\n\nΔH_combustion = -877.1 + 74.8\n\nΔH_combustion = -802.3 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change for the combustion of methane is -802.3 kJ/mol."
