    "message_2": "The nitrate ion (NO3-) has three possible resonance structures. In each of these structures, the nitrogen atom is at the center, and the three oxygen atoms are surrounding it. The nitrogen atom has a positive charge, and one of the oxygen atoms has a negative charge in each structure. The three resonance structures differ in the position of the double bond between the nitrogen and one of the oxygen atoms, as well as the location of the negative charge on the oxygen atoms.\n\nResonance Structure 1:\n- Double bond between N and O1\n- Single bonds between N and O2, N and O3\n- Negative charge on O2\n\nResonance Structure 2:\n- Double bond between N and O2\n- Single bonds between N and O1, N and O3\n- Negative charge on O3\n\nResonance Structure 3:\n- Double bond between N and O3\n- Single bonds between N and O1, N and O2\n- Negative charge on O1\n\nThe resonance hybrid structure of the nitrate ion is different from any of the contributing resonance structures because it represents an average of all three resonance structures. In the resonance hybrid, the nitrogen atom is still at the center, and the three oxygen atoms are surrounding it. However, instead of having distinct single and double bonds, the nitrogen-oxygen bonds are of equal length and strength, with a bond order of 1.33 (between a single and double bond). The negative charge is also delocalized over the three oxygen atoms, meaning that each oxygen atom has a partial negative charge of -1/3. This delocalization of charge and equal bond lengths contribute to the stability of the nitrate ion."
