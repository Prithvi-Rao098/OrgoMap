    "message_1": "What is the activation energy of the electrochemical reaction between Zinc and Hydrochloric acid when the temperature is increased from 25°C to 35°C, given a concentration of 0.1 M HCl and 1 g of Zinc?",
    "message_2": "To determine the activation energy of the electrochemical reaction between Zinc and Hydrochloric acid, we can use the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk = Ae^(-Ea/RT)\n\nwhere k is the rate constant, A is the pre-exponential factor, Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nHowever, we need more information to solve this problem. Specifically, we need the rate constants (k) at both 25°C and 35°C. Once we have those values, we can use the Arrhenius equation to find the activation energy (Ea).\n\nIf you can provide the rate constants at both temperatures, I can help you calculate the activation energy."
