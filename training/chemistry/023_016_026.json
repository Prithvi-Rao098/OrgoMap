    "message_2": "The preparation of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline from aniline and chlorine gas involves a two-step process: nitration followed by chlorination. Here's the complete mechanism:\n\nStep 1: Nitration of aniline\n1. Protonation of aniline: Aniline (C6H5NH2) reacts with a strong acid, such as concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4), to form the anilinium ion (C6H5NH3+).\nC6H5NH2 + H2SO4 -> C6H5NH3+ + HSO4-\n\n2. Formation of nitronium ion: Concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) reacts with the sulfuric acid to form the nitronium ion (NO2+), which is the active electrophile in the nitration process.\nHNO3 + 2H2SO4 -> NO2+ + H3O+ + 2HSO4-\n\n3. Electrophilic aromatic substitution: The nitronium ion (NO2+) attacks the anilinium ion at the para position, forming a para-nitroaniline intermediate.\nC6H5NH3+ + NO2+ -> C6H4(NH3+)(NO2) + H+\n\n4. Deprotonation: The para-nitroaniline intermediate loses a proton to form para-nitroaniline (p-nitroaniline, C6H4(NH2)(NO2)).\nC6H4(NH3+)(NO2) + HSO4- -> C6H4(NH2)(NO2) + H2SO4\n\nStep 2: Chlorination of p-nitroaniline\n1. Activation of chlorine gas: Chlorine gas (Cl2) is activated in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, such as aluminum chloride (AlCl3), to form a chloronium ion (Cl+).\nCl2 + AlCl3 -> Cl+ + AlCl4-\n\n2. Electrophilic aromatic substitution: The chloronium ion (Cl+) attacks the p-nitroaniline at the ortho position, forming an ortho-chloro-p-nitroaniline intermediate.\nC6H4(NH2)(NO2) + Cl+ -> C6H3(NH2)(NO2)(Cl) + H+\n\n3. Rearrangement: The ortho-chloro-p-nitroaniline intermediate rearranges to form the more stable 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline (C6H3(NH2)(NO2)(Cl)).\nC6H3(NH2)(NO2)(Cl) -> 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline\n\nThe final product is 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline."
