    "message_2": "The dipole moment of a hydrogen fluoride (HF) molecule is approximately 1.91 D (Debye), where 1 D = 3.336 × 10^(-30) C·m. The dipole moment points from the hydrogen atom to the fluorine atom, as fluorine is more electronegative than hydrogen. This results in a partial positive charge on the hydrogen atom and a partial negative charge on the fluorine atom, creating a dipole moment in the direction of the fluorine atom."
