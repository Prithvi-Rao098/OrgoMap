    "message_2": "To calculate the nuclear binding energy per nucleon, we first need to find the mass defect and then convert it to energy using Einstein's famous equation, E=mc^2. \n\n1. Determine the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus:\nThe atomic number (Z) is 22, which means there are 22 protons. The mass number (A) is 50, so there are 50 - 22 = 28 neutrons.\n\n2. Calculate the mass of the nucleus in atomic mass units (amu):\nMass of protons = 22 protons * 1.007276466812 amu/proton = 22.15988107 amu\nMass of neutrons = 28 neutrons * 1.008664915 amu/neutron = 28.24261762 amu\nTotal mass of protons and neutrons = 22.15988107 amu + 28.24261762 amu = 50.40249869 amu\n\n3. Find the mass defect (Δm):\nThe actual mass of the nucleus will be slightly less than the sum of the individual masses of protons and neutrons due to the binding energy. To find the mass defect, we need to know the actual mass of the nucleus. You can find this information in a table of isotopes or use an online resource. For this example, let's assume the actual mass of the nucleus is 49.9951 amu.\n\nMass defect (Δm) = Total mass of protons and neutrons - Actual mass of the nucleus\nΔm = 50.40249869 amu - 49.9951 amu = 0.40739869 amu\n\n4. Convert the mass defect to energy (E) using Einstein's equation, E=mc^2:\nFirst, we need to convert the mass defect from atomic mass units (amu) to kilograms (kg). 1 amu = 1.66053906660 × 10^-27 kg.\n\nΔm = 0.40739869 amu * 1.66053906660 × 10^-27 kg/amu = 6.7698004 × 10^-28 kg\n\nNow, we can use Einstein's equation to find the energy. The speed of light (c) is approximately 3 × 10^8 m/s.\n\nE = (6.7698004 × 10^-28 kg) * (3 × 10^8 m/s)^2 = 1.816324 × 10^-11 Joules\n\n5. Convert the energy to MeV (Mega-electron volts):\n1 Joule = 6.242 × 10^12 MeV\n\nE = 1.816324 × 10^-11 Joules * 6.242 × 10^12 MeV/Joule = 113.4 MeV\n\n6. Calculate the nuclear binding energy per nucleon:\nBinding energy per nucleon = Total binding energy / Number of nucleons\nBinding energy per nucleon = 113.4 MeV / 50 nucleons = 2.268 MeV/nucleon\n\nSo, the nuclear binding energy per nucleon for this nucleus is approximately 2.268 MeV/nucleon."
