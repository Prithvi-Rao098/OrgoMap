    "message_2": "The primary structure of a protein refers to the linear sequence of amino acids that make up the polypeptide chain. It is the most basic level of protein structure and is determined by the specific order of amino acids in the chain, which are linked together by peptide bonds. The primary structure is encoded by the genetic information in the DNA of an organism.\n\nThe primary structure is crucial for the protein's function because it determines the overall folding and conformation of the protein. The amino acid sequence influences the formation of secondary structures (such as alpha-helices and beta-sheets) and tertiary structures (the overall three-dimensional shape of the protein). These higher-order structures are essential for the protein's function, as they determine the protein's stability, its ability to interact with other molecules, and its catalytic activity (if it is an enzyme).\n\nAny alteration in the primary structure, such as a mutation that changes an amino acid, can potentially affect the protein's function. Depending on the location and nature of the change, it may lead to a loss of function, reduced activity, or even a gain of function. In some cases, these alterations can have significant consequences, such as causing genetic diseases or affecting an organism's ability to survive and reproduce."
