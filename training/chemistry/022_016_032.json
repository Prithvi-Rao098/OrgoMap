Here's a question for the student to solve:\n\nCalculate the enthalpy change for the reaction in which 2 moles of methane (CH₄) gas reacts with 1 mole of oxygen (O₂) gas to form 2 moles of water (H₂O) vapor and 1 mole of carbon dioxide (CO₂) gas, given the following enthalpy changes of formation: \n\nΔHᶠ(CH₄) = -74.8 kJ/mol \nΔHᶠ(O₂) = 0 kJ/mol \nΔHᶠ(H₂O) = -241.8 kJ/mol \nΔHᶠ(CO₂) = -393.5 kJ/mol \n\nAssume that all reactants and products are in their standard state, and that the reaction is happening at constant pressure and temperature.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH = Σ ΔHᶠ(products) - Σ ΔHᶠ(reactants)\n\nFirst, let's write down the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\n2 CH₄(g) + O₂(g) → 2 H₂O(g) + CO₂(g)\n\nNow, let's calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nΔH = [(2 × ΔHᶠ(H₂O) + 1 × ΔHᶠ(CO₂)) - (2 × ΔHᶠ(CH₄) + 1 × ΔHᶠ(O₂))]\n\nΔH = [(2 × -241.8 kJ/mol) + (-393.5 kJ/mol) - (2 × -74.8 kJ/mol) + 0 kJ/mol]\n\nΔH = [-483.6 kJ/mol - (-149.6 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH = -334 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the enthalpy change for the reaction is -334 kJ/mol."
