    "message_2": "To determine the rate of decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, we can use the formula:\n\nRate = (Amount of H2O2 decomposed) / (Time taken for decomposition)\n\nGiven that 2.5 grams of H2O2 decomposes in 50 seconds, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nRate = (2.5 g) / (50 s) = 0.05 g/s\n\nSo, the rate of decomposition of hydrogen peroxide is 0.05 grams per second at a temperature of 25°C and a pressure of 1 atm."
