    "message_2": "The bond enthalpy of the carbon-oxygen double bond in a carbon dioxide molecule (CO2) is given as the bond dissociation energy for the C=O double bond. In this case, the bond dissociation energy for the C=O double bond is provided as 799 kJ/mol. Therefore, the bond enthalpy of the carbon-oxygen double bond in CO2 is 799 kJ/mol."
