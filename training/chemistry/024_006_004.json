The overall heat transfer coefficient is given as 500 W/m²K.",
    "message_2": "To determine the minimum surface area required for the heat exchanger, we will use the following equation:\n\nQ = U * A * LMTD\n\nWhere:\nQ = heat transfer rate (W)\nU = overall heat transfer coefficient (W/m²K)\nA = surface area (m²)\nLMTD = logarithmic mean temperature difference (K)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the heat transfer rate (Q). We can do this by using the specific heat capacity of water (c_p = 4.18 kJ/kgK) and the mass flow rate of the liquid stream (m_dot).\n\nQ = m_dot * c_p * (T_in - T_out)\n\nWe are given the flow rate in liters per hour, so we need to convert it to kg/s. Assuming the density of the liquid stream is the same as water (ρ = 1000 kg/m³), we can convert the flow rate as follows:\n\n1,000 L/h * (1 m³/1,000 L) * (1,000 kg/m³) * (1 h/3600 s) = 0.2778 kg/s\n\nNow we can calculate the heat transfer rate (Q):\n\nQ = 0.2778 kg/s * 4.18 kJ/kgK * (80°C - 40°C) * (1,000 W/kW)\nQ = 46.67 kW (46,670 W)\n\nNext, we need to calculate the LMTD. The formula for LMTD is:\n\nLMTD = (ΔT_1 - ΔT_2) / ln(ΔT_1/ΔT_2)\n\nWhere:\nΔT_1 = temperature difference between the hot and cold streams at one end of the heat exchanger (K)\nΔT_2 = temperature difference between the hot and cold streams at the other end of the heat exchanger (K)\n\nΔT_1 = 80°C - 20°C = 60 K\nΔT_2 = 40°C - 50°C = -10 K\n\nLMTD = (60 K - (-10 K)) / ln(60 K / (-10 K))\nLMTD = 70 K / ln(-6)\nLMTD = -23.67 K (Since LMTD cannot be negative, we will use the absolute value: 23.67 K)\n\nFinally, we can calculate the minimum surface area (A) required for the heat exchanger:\n\nA = Q / (U * LMTD)\nA = 46,670 W / (500 W/m²K * 23.67 K)\nA = 46,670 W / 11,835 W/m²\nA = 3.94 m²\n\nTherefore, the minimum surface area required for the heat exchanger is 3.94 m²."
