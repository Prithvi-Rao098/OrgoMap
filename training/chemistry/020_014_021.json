If the temperature of the solution is increased to 35°C, what is the new percent ionization of acetic acid? Assume that the ionization constant of acetic acid, Ka, does not change with temperature.",
    "message_2": "To find the percent ionization of a 0.1 M acetic acid solution at 25°C when the pH is 4.2, we first need to determine the concentration of hydronium ions (H3O+) in the solution. We can do this using the pH formula:\n\npH = -log[H3O+]\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for [H3O+] gives:\n\n[H3O+] = 10^(-pH)\n\nPlugging in the given pH of 4.2:\n\n[H3O+] = 10^(-4.2) = 6.31 × 10^(-5) M\n\nNow, we can use the ionization constant of acetic acid (Ka) to find the concentration of acetate ions (CH3COO-) and the remaining concentration of acetic acid (CH3COOH). The Ka of acetic acid is 1.8 × 10^(-5) at 25°C. The ionization reaction of acetic acid is:\n\nCH3COOH + H2O ⇌ CH3COO- + H3O+\n\nThe Ka expression is:\n\nKa = ([CH3COO-][H3O+])/[CH3COOH]\n\nSince the initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.1 M, we can set up an equilibrium table:\n\n          CH3COOH   +   H2O   ⇌   CH3COO-   +   H3O+\nInitial:    0.1 M             0 M          0 M\nChange:    -x M              +x M         +x M\nFinal:     0.1 - x M          x M          x M\n\nWe know that [H3O+] = 6.31 × 10^(-5) M, so x = 6.31 × 10^(-5) M. Plugging this into the Ka expression:\n\n1.8 × 10^(-5) = (6.31 × 10^(-5) * 6.31 × 10^(-5))/(0.1 - 6.31 × 10^(-5))\n\nSolving for x, we find that x = 6.31 × 10^(-5) M, which is the concentration of CH3COO- ions.\n\nNow, we can calculate the percent ionization:\n\nPercent ionization = ([H3O+] / initial concentration of acetic acid) × 100\n\nPercent ionization = (6.31 × 10^(-5) / 0.1) × 100 = 0.0631%\n\nWhen the temperature is increased to 35°C, we are assuming that the Ka value does not change. Since the Ka value remains constant, the percent ionization will also remain the same. Therefore, the percent ionization of acetic acid at 35°C is still 0.0631%."
