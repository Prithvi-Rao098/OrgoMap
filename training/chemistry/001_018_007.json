    "message_2": "To find the pH of a 0.1 M solution of benzoic acid, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log ([A-]/[HA])\n\nwhere pH is the acidity of the solution, pKa is the acid dissociation constant, [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base, and [HA] is the concentration of the undissociated acid.\n\nFor benzoic acid, the pKa is given as 4.2. Since the solution is 0.1 M, we can assume that the initial concentration of benzoic acid ([HA]) is 0.1 M. The dissociation of benzoic acid in water can be represented as:\n\nC6H5COOH (benzoic acid) ↔ C6H5COO- (conjugate base) + H+\n\nInitially, the concentration of the conjugate base (C6H5COO-) is 0. Let x be the change in concentration of benzoic acid after dissociation. Then, the concentration of the conjugate base will be x, and the concentration of the undissociated benzoic acid will be (0.1 - x).\n\nNow, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = 4.2 + log (x/(0.1 - x))\n\nSince the pKa of benzoic acid is 4.2, it is a weak acid, and we can assume that x is small compared to 0.1. Therefore, we can approximate the equation as:\n\npH ≈ 4.2 + log (x/0.1)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of x. We can use the expression for the acid dissociation constant (Ka):\n\nKa = [C6H5COO-][H+]/[C6H5COOH]\n\nSince x is the concentration of both C6H5COO- and H+, the expression becomes:\n\nKa = x^2/(0.1 - x)\n\nWe can find the Ka value from the given pKa:\n\npKa = -log(Ka)\nKa = 10^(-pKa) = 10^(-4.2) ≈ 6.31 × 10^(-5)\n\nNow, we can substitute the Ka value into the equation:\n\n6.31 × 10^(-5) ≈ x^2/(0.1 - x)\n\nSince x is small compared to 0.1, we can approximate the equation as:\n\n6.31 × 10^(-5) ≈ x^2/0.1\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx^2 ≈ 6.31 × 10^(-5) × 0.1\nx^2 ≈ 6.31 × 10^(-6)\nx ≈ √(6.31 × 10^(-6)) ≈ 2.51 × 10^(-3)\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of x back into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH ≈ 4.2 + log (2.51 × 10^(-3)/0.1)\npH ≈ 4.2 + log (0.0251)\npH ≈ 4.2 - 1.6\npH ≈ 2.6\n\nTherefore, the pH of a 0.1 M solution of benzoic acid with a pKa of 4.2 is approximately 2.6."
