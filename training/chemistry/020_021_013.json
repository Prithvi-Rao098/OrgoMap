    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (K) for the redox reaction, we first need to determine the overall balanced redox reaction and the standard cell potential (E°cell) for the reaction.\n\nThe overall balanced redox reaction is:\n\nCu2+(aq) + 2Ag(s) → Cu(s) + 2Ag+(aq)\n\nTo find E°cell, subtract the E° value of the reduction half-reaction from the E° value of the oxidation half-reaction:\n\nE°cell = E°(Cu2+/Cu) - E°(Ag+/Ag) = 0.34 V - 0.80 V = -0.46 V\n\nNow, we can use the Nernst equation to find the equilibrium constant (K):\n\nE°cell = - (RT/nF) * ln(K)\n\nWhere R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin (25°C = 298 K), n is the number of electrons transferred (2 in this case), and F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol).\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for K:\n\nln(K) = -nFE°cell/RT\n\nK = e^(-nFE°cell/RT)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nK = e^(-2 * 96485 * -0.46 / (8.314 * 298))\nK ≈ 1.1 × 10^10\n\nNow, to find the concentration of Cu2+ ions at equilibrium, we can use the reaction quotient (Q) and the equilibrium constant (K):\n\nQ = [Cu2+]/[Ag+]^2\n\nAt equilibrium, Q = K:\n\n1.1 × 10^10 = [Cu2+]/(0.10 - x)^2\n\nLet y = [Cu2+] at equilibrium, then:\n\n1.1 × 10^10 = y/(0.10 - (0.15 - y))^2\n\nSolving for y:\n\ny ≈ 0.15 M\n\nSo, the concentration of Cu2+ ions at equilibrium is approximately 0.15 M."
