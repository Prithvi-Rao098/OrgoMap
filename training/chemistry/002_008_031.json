    "message_2": "To find the percent composition by mass of potassium permanganate (KMnO4), we first need to determine the molar mass of each element in the compound and then calculate the percentage of each element.\n\n1. Find the molar mass of each element in the compound:\n- Potassium (K): 39.10 g/mol\n- Manganese (Mn): 54.94 g/mol\n- Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol\n\n2. Calculate the molar mass of KMnO4:\nMolar mass of KMnO4 = (1 × molar mass of K) + (1 × molar mass of Mn) + (4 × molar mass of O)\nMolar mass of KMnO4 = (1 × 39.10) + (1 × 54.94) + (4 × 16.00)\nMolar mass of KMnO4 = 39.10 + 54.94 + 64.00\nMolar mass of KMnO4 = 158.04 g/mol\n\n3. Calculate the percent composition by mass of each element:\n- Percent composition of K = (molar mass of K / molar mass of KMnO4) × 100\nPercent composition of K = (39.10 / 158.04) × 100 = 24.74%\n\n- Percent composition of Mn = (molar mass of Mn / molar mass of KMnO4) × 100\nPercent composition of Mn = (54.94 / 158.04) × 100 = 34.77%\n\n- Percent composition of O = (molar mass of O × 4 / molar mass of KMnO4) × 100\nPercent composition of O = (64.00 / 158.04) × 100 = 40.49%\n\nSo, the percent composition by mass of potassium permanganate (KMnO4) is approximately:\n- Potassium (K): 24.74%\n- Manganese (Mn): 34.77%\n- Oxygen (O): 40.49%"
