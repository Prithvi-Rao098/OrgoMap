    "message_2": "The preparation of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline from aniline can be carried out in two steps:\n\n1. Nitration of aniline to form 4-nitroaniline\n2. Chlorination of 4-nitroaniline to form 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline\n\nStep 1: Nitration of aniline\nAniline (C6H5NH2) reacts with a nitrating mixture, which is a mixture of concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and concentrated nitric acid (HNO3), to form 4-nitroaniline (C6H4(NO2)NH2).\n\nReaction conditions:\n- Temperature: 0-5°C (ice bath)\n- Concentration: Aniline is dissolved in a minimum amount of dilute H2SO4 (1:1 ratio) before adding the nitrating mixture dropwise.\n- No specific pressure is required for this reaction.\n\nStep 2: Chlorination of 4-nitroaniline\n4-nitroaniline reacts with chlorine gas (Cl2) in the presence of a catalyst, such as ferric chloride (FeCl3), to form 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline (C6H3(NO2)NH2Cl).\n\nReaction conditions:\n- Temperature: Room temperature (25°C)\n- Pressure: Atmospheric pressure\n- Concentration: 4-nitroaniline is dissolved in a suitable solvent, such as acetic acid, and chlorine gas is bubbled through the solution.\n\nPercentage yield:\nTo determine the percentage yield, you would need to know the actual yield of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline obtained from the reaction and the theoretical yield based on the stoichiometry of the reaction. The percentage yield can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPercentage yield = (Actual yield / Theoretical yield) × 100\n\nPurification methods:\nThe obtained product, 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline, can be purified using the following methods:\n1. Recrystallization: Dissolve the crude product in a suitable solvent, such as ethanol, and heat the solution. Cool the solution slowly to allow the formation of crystals, then filter and wash the crystals with cold solvent to remove impurities.\n2. Column chromatography: Separate the product from impurities using a column packed with a stationary phase (e.g., silica gel) and an appropriate mobile phase (e.g., a mixture of hexane and ethyl acetate). Collect the fractions containing the desired product and evaporate the solvent to obtain the purified 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline."
