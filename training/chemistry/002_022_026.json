    "message_2": "To calculate the lattice energy of calcium fluoride (CaF2), we can use the Born-Lande equation:\n\nLattice energy (U) = N * A * (1 - 1/n) * (z+ * z-) * e^2 / (4 * π * ε0 * r0)\n\nwhere:\nN = Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23 mol^-1)\nA = Born-Lande equation constant (2.56)\nn = Born exponent (we can assume n = 9 for most ionic compounds)\nz+ = charge of the cation (Ca2+ = +2)\nz- = charge of the anion (F- = -1)\ne = elementary charge (1.602 x 10^-19 C)\nε0 = vacuum permittivity (8.854 x 10^-12 C²/J·m)\nr0 = sum of the ionic radii (100 pm + 133 pm = 233 pm = 2.33 x 10^-10 m)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the equation:\n\nU = (6.022 x 10^23 mol^-1) * (2.56) * (1 - 1/9) * (2 * 1) * (1.602 x 10^-19 C)^2 / (4 * π * (8.854 x 10^-12 C²/J·m) * (2.33 x 10^-10 m))\n\nU = (6.022 x 10^23 mol^-1) * (2.56) * (8/9) * (2) * (2.56 x 10^-38 C²) / (4 * π * (8.854 x 10^-12 C²/J·m) * (2.33 x 10^-10 m))\n\nU = (6.022 x 10^23 mol^-1) * (2.56) * (8/9) * (2) * (2.56 x 10^-38 C²) / (2.93 x 10^-20 J·m)\n\nU = 2.63 x 10^6 J/mol\n\nSince we want the lattice energy in kJ/mol, we can convert it:\n\nU = 2.63 x 10^6 J/mol * (1 kJ / 1000 J) = 2630 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the lattice energy of calcium fluoride (CaF2) is approximately 2630 kJ/mol."
