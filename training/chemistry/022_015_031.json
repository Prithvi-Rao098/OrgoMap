    "message_1": "A student performs a chemical reaction between 12.5 grams of magnesium and 15.0 grams of hydrochloric acid to produce magnesium chloride and hydrogen gas. If the theoretical yield of magnesium chloride is 25.7 grams, calculate the percent yield of the reaction.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the percent yield of the reaction, we first need to determine the limiting reactant and the actual yield of magnesium chloride.\n\n1. Determine the moles of reactants:\nMoles of magnesium (Mg) = mass / molar mass\nMg has a molar mass of 24.31 g/mol.\nMoles of Mg = 12.5 g / 24.31 g/mol = 0.514 mol\n\nMoles of hydrochloric acid (HCl) = mass / molar mass\nHCl has a molar mass of 36.46 g/mol.\nMoles of HCl = 15.0 g / 36.46 g/mol = 0.411 mol\n\n2. Determine the limiting reactant:\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\nMg + 2HCl â†’ MgCl2 + H2\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mol of Mg reacts with 2 mol of HCl. Therefore, we need to compare the mole ratio of Mg to HCl to determine the limiting reactant.\n\nMole ratio of Mg to HCl = 0.514 mol Mg / 0.411 mol HCl = 1.25\n\nSince the mole ratio is greater than 1, HCl is the limiting reactant.\n\n3. Calculate the actual yield of magnesium chloride (MgCl2):\nUsing the stoichiometry from the balanced equation, 2 mol of HCl produces 1 mol of MgCl2. Therefore, we can calculate the moles of MgCl2 produced:\n\nMoles of MgCl2 = 0.411 mol HCl * (1 mol MgCl2 / 2 mol HCl) = 0.2055 mol MgCl2\n\nNow, convert the moles of MgCl2 to grams:\nMass of MgCl2 = moles * molar mass\nMgCl2 has a molar mass of 95.21 g/mol.\nMass of MgCl2 = 0.2055 mol * 95.21 g/mol = 19.56 g\n\n4. Calculate the percent yield:\nPercent yield = (actual yield / theoretical yield) * 100\nPercent yield = (19.56 g / 25.7 g) * 100 = 76.1%\n\nThe percent yield of the reaction is 76.1%."
