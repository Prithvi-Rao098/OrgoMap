    "message_2": "To determine the molecular orbital (MO) diagram and electronic structure of carbon dioxide (CO2) using the Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals - Molecular Orbital (LCAO-MO) theory, we need to consider the atomic orbitals of carbon and oxygen atoms and their interactions.\n\nCarbon has an electronic configuration of 1s² 2s² 2p², while oxygen has an electronic configuration of 1s² 2s² 2p⁴. In CO2, carbon is the central atom, and the molecule has a linear geometry. The atomic orbitals of carbon that participate in bonding are the 2s and 2p orbitals. For oxygen, the 2s and 2p orbitals are involved in bonding.\n\nThe LCAO-MO theory involves the combination of atomic orbitals to form molecular orbitals. In CO2, the 2s orbitals of carbon and oxygen combine to form σ and σ* (sigma and sigma star) molecular orbitals. The 2px orbitals of carbon and oxygen also combine to form σ and σ* molecular orbitals. The 2py and 2pz orbitals of carbon and oxygen combine to form π and π* molecular orbitals.\n\nThe molecular orbital diagram for CO2 is as follows:\n\n1. Lowest energy level: 1s orbitals of both oxygen atoms (non-bonding orbitals)\n2. Next energy level: 2s orbitals of both oxygen atoms (non-bonding orbitals)\n3. Next energy level: 2s orbital of carbon and 2s orbitals of both oxygen atoms combine to form σ and σ* molecular orbitals.\n4. Next energy level: 2px orbital of carbon and 2px orbitals of both oxygen atoms combine to form σ and σ* molecular orbitals.\n5. Next energy level: 2py and 2pz orbitals of carbon and oxygen atoms combine to form π and π* molecular orbitals.\n\nThe electronic structure of CO2 can be represented as follows:\n\n1. The 1s orbitals of both oxygen atoms are filled with 2 electrons each (total 4 electrons).\n2. The 2s orbitals of both oxygen atoms are filled with 2 electrons each (total 4 electrons).\n3. The σ orbital formed from the combination of 2s orbitals is filled with 2 electrons.\n4. The σ orbital formed from the combination of 2px orbitals is filled with 2 electrons.\n5. The π orbitals formed from the combination of 2py and 2pz orbitals are filled with 4 electrons (2 electrons in each orbital).\n\nIn summary, the molecular orbital diagram of CO2 consists of σ, σ*, π, and π* molecular orbitals, and the electronic structure includes 16 electrons distributed among these orbitals. The molecule has a linear geometry with double bonds between the carbon and oxygen atoms."
