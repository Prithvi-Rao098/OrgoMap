    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction, we can use the formula:\n\nKc = [Products] / [Reactants]\n\nFor the given reaction, N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g), the formula becomes:\n\nKc = ([NH3]^2) / ([N2] * [H2]^3)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given concentrations:\n\nKc = ([0.75]^2) / ([0.20] * [0.50]^3)\n\nKc = (0.5625) / (0.20 * 0.125)\n\nKc = 0.5625 / 0.025\n\nKc = 22.5\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction at 298 K is 22.5."
