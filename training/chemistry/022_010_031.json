    "message_2": "The reaction between silver nitrate (AgNO3) and potassium chloride (KCl) produces a white precipitate of silver chloride (AgCl) and potassium nitrate (KNO3) in solution. The balanced molecular equation is:\n\nAgNO3(aq) + KCl(aq) → AgCl(s) + KNO3(aq)\n\nTo find the net ionic equation, we first write the complete ionic equation by breaking down the soluble ionic compounds into their respective ions:\n\nAg⁺(aq) + NO₃⁻(aq) + K⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq) → AgCl(s) + K⁺(aq) + NO₃⁻(aq)\n\nNow, we can identify and remove the spectator ions, which are the ions that do not participate in the reaction. In this case, the spectator ions are K⁺(aq) and NO₃⁻(aq). Removing these ions, we get the net ionic equation:\n\nAg⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq) → AgCl(s)\n\nThis net ionic equation shows the formation of the white precipitate, silver chloride (AgCl), as a result of the reaction between silver nitrate and potassium chloride."
