    "message_2": "To have a solid foundation in chemistry, students should be able to identify and balance the following common types of chemical reactions and their respective equations:\n\n1. Synthesis (Combination) Reaction:\nA + B → AB\nExample: 2H₂(g) + O₂(g) → 2H₂O(l)\n\n2. Decomposition Reaction:\nAB → A + B\nExample: 2H₂O(l) → 2H₂(g) + O₂(g)\n\n3. Single Displacement (Replacement) Reaction:\nA + BC → AC + B\nExample: Zn(s) + 2HCl(aq) → ZnCl₂(aq) + H₂(g)\n\n4. Double Displacement (Metathesis) Reaction:\nAB + CD → AD + CB\nExample: AgNO₃(aq) + NaCl(aq) → AgCl(s) + NaNO₃(aq)\n\n5. Combustion Reaction:\nHydrocarbon + O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + H₂O(l)\nExample: C₃H₈(g) + 5O₂(g) → 3CO₂(g) + 4H₂O(l)\n\n6. Acid-Base (Neutralization) Reaction:\nAcid + Base → Salt + Water\nExample: HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H₂O(l)\n\n7. Redox (Oxidation-Reduction) Reaction:\nExample: 2Al(s) + 3Cu²⁺(aq) → 2Al³⁺(aq) + 3Cu(s)\n\nStudents should practice identifying the reactants and products in these reactions and learn how to balance the equations by adjusting the coefficients to ensure the same number of atoms for each element on both sides of the equation."
