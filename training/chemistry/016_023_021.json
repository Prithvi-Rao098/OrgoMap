    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 2 moles of sucrose, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH = ΣΔH(products) - ΣΔH(reactants)\n\nThe hydrolysis of sucrose can be represented by the following balanced chemical equation:\n\nC12H22O11 + H2O → C6H12O6 (glucose) + C6H12O6 (fructose)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given standard enthalpies of formation:\n\nΔH = [(-1274 kJ/mol) + (-915 kJ/mol)] - [(-2220 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH = (-2189 kJ/mol) - (-2220 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH = 31 kJ/mol\n\nSince we are calculating the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 2 moles of sucrose, we need to multiply the enthalpy change per mole by 2:\n\nΔH_total = 31 kJ/mol × 2 moles\n\nΔH_total = 62 kJ\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 2 moles of sucrose is 62 kJ."
