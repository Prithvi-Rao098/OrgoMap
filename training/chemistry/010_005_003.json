    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant, K, for the given electrochemical reaction, we first need to determine the overall balanced redox reaction and the corresponding cell potential (E°cell).\n\nThe balanced redox reaction is:\n2 H+ (aq) + 2 e- + Fe3+ (aq) → H2 (g) + Fe2+ (aq)\n\nThe cell potential (E°cell) is the difference between the reduction potentials of the two half-reactions:\nE°cell = E°(Fe3+/Fe2+) - E°(H+/H2)\nE°cell = 0.771 V - 0.00 V\nE°cell = 0.771 V\n\nNow, we can use the Nernst equation to find the equilibrium constant, K. The Nernst equation is:\n\nE°cell = (RT/nF) * ln(K)\n\nwhere R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin (298 K), n is the number of electrons transferred (2 in this case), and F is the Faraday constant (96485 C/mol).\n\nRearranging the Nernst equation to solve for K:\n\nK = exp(nF * E°cell / RT)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nK = exp(2 * 96485 C/mol * 0.771 V / (8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K))\n\nK = exp(1490.37)\n\nK ≈ 4.38 × 10^646\n\nThe equilibrium constant, K, for the given electrochemical reaction is approximately 4.38 × 10^646."
