    "message_2": "To synthesize aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) from salicylic acid and acetic anhydride, the reaction is as follows:\n\nsalicylic acid (C7H6O3) + acetic anhydride (C4H6O3) â†’ aspirin (C9H8O4) + acetic acid (C2H4O2)\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that one mole of salicylic acid reacts with one mole of acetic anhydride to produce one mole of aspirin and one mole of acetic acid. Therefore, the molar ratio of salicylic acid to acetic anhydride required for the synthesis of aspirin is 1:1."
