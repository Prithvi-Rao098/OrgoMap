    "message_1": "A student wants to determine the mass of silver (Ag) that will be deposited on the cathode when a current of 4 A passes through a solution of silver nitrate (AgNO3) for 30 minutes. What is the mass of silver that will be deposited on the cathode? (Assume a Faraday constant of 96,485 C/mol and the atomic mass of silver is 107.87 g/mol).",
    "message_2": "To determine the mass of silver deposited on the cathode, we can use Faraday's law of electrolysis, which states that the amount of substance deposited is directly proportional to the charge passed through the solution.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total charge passed through the solution. We can do this using the formula:\n\nCharge (Q) = Current (I) × Time (t)\n\nGiven that the current (I) is 4 A and the time (t) is 30 minutes (which we need to convert to seconds), we have:\n\nQ = 4 A × (30 × 60) s\nQ = 4 A × 1800 s\nQ = 7200 C\n\nNow, we can use the Faraday constant (F) to determine the number of moles of electrons (n) that have been transferred:\n\nn = Q / F\nn = 7200 C / 96,485 C/mol\nn ≈ 0.0746 mol\n\nSince the reaction occurring at the cathode is the reduction of silver ions (Ag+) to form silver atoms (Ag), the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1. This means that 1 mole of electrons will deposit 1 mole of silver. Therefore, the number of moles of silver deposited is equal to the number of moles of electrons transferred:\n\nMoles of Ag = 0.0746 mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the mass of silver deposited using the atomic mass of silver (107.87 g/mol):\n\nMass of Ag = Moles of Ag × Atomic mass of Ag\nMass of Ag = 0.0746 mol × 107.87 g/mol\nMass of Ag ≈ 8.05 g\n\nSo, the mass of silver that will be deposited on the cathode is approximately 8.05 grams."
