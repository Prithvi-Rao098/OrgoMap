    "message_1": "What hybrid orbitals are present in the molecule CH2O?",
    "message_2": "In the molecule CH2O (formaldehyde), the central atom is carbon. The carbon atom forms two single bonds with two hydrogen atoms and a double bond with the oxygen atom. To accommodate these bonds, the carbon atom undergoes sp2 hybridization, which results in three sp2 hybrid orbitals. The oxygen atom also undergoes sp2 hybridization to form a double bond with the carbon atom. Therefore, the hybrid orbitals present in the CH2O molecule are sp2 hybrid orbitals."
