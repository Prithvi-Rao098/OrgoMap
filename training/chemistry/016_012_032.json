(Assuming the specific heat capacity of the solution is 4.18 J/g°C and the density of the solution is 1.00 g/mL)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the heat of neutralization, we first need to determine the moles of the reactants and the limiting reactant.\n\nMoles of HCl = (Volume in L) x (Molarity)\nMoles of HCl = (50 mL x (1 L / 1000 mL)) x 2 M = 0.1 moles\n\nMoles of NaOH = (Volume in L) x (Molarity)\nMoles of NaOH = (50 mL x (1 L / 1000 mL)) x 2 M = 0.1 moles\n\nSince both reactants have the same number of moles, neither is the limiting reactant. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nHCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H2O(l)\n\nThe heat of neutralization for the reaction between HCl and NaOH is approximately -57.32 kJ/mol. Since we have 0.1 moles of each reactant, we can calculate the heat released during the reaction:\n\nHeat released = (moles of reactants) x (heat of neutralization)\nHeat released = (0.1 moles) x (-57.32 kJ/mol) = -5.732 kJ\n\nThe heat of neutralization for the reaction between 50 mL of 2 M hydrochloric acid (HCl) and 50 mL of 2 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) at a constant temperature of 25°C is -5.732 kJ."
