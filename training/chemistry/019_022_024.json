The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:  \nC2H5OH(l) + 3O2(g) → 2CO2(g) + 3H2O(l)\nGiven:\nΔHf°(C2H5OH(l)) = -277.7 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(CO2(g)) = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(H2O(l)) = -285.8 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(O2(g)) = 0 kJ/mol",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the following formula:\n\nΔH°(reaction) = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants)\n\nFor the products, we have 2 moles of CO2(g) and 3 moles of H2O(l):\nΣ ΔHf°(products) = (2 × -393.5 kJ/mol) + (3 × -285.8 kJ/mol) = -787.0 kJ/mol + -857.4 kJ/mol = -1644.4 kJ/mol\n\nFor the reactants, we have 1 mole of C2H5OH(l) and 3 moles of O2(g):\nΣ ΔHf°(reactants) = (-277.7 kJ/mol) + (3 × 0 kJ/mol) = -277.7 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction:\nΔH°(reaction) = -1644.4 kJ/mol - (-277.7 kJ/mol) = -1366.7 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the combustion of 1 mole of liquid ethanol at 298K and 1 atm is -1366.7 kJ/mol."
