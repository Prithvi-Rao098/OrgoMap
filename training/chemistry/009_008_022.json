    "message_2": "To determine the minimum detectable activity (MDA) of a Geiger-Muller detector for beta particles, we need to consider the counting efficiency and the background count rate. The MDA is the activity level at which the detector can confidently distinguish between the sample count rate and the background count rate.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the critical level (Lc), which is the count rate at which the sample count rate can be distinguished from the background count rate with a certain level of confidence. A commonly used formula for Lc is:\n\nLc = 1.645 * √(2 * B)\n\nwhere B is the background count rate (100 counts per minute in this case).\n\nLc = 1.645 * √(2 * 100)\nLc ≈ 23 counts per minute\n\nNow, we need to determine the net count rate (N) by adding the critical level to the background count rate:\n\nN = B + Lc\nN = 100 + 23\nN = 123 counts per minute\n\nSince we know the counting efficiency (20% or 0.2), we can calculate the gross count rate (G) by dividing the net count rate by the counting efficiency:\n\nG = N / efficiency\nG = 123 / 0.2\nG = 615 counts per minute\n\nFinally, we can calculate the minimum detectable activity (MDA) by dividing the gross count rate by the conversion factor (k) that relates the count rate to the activity. For beta particles with an energy of 0.5 MeV, a typical conversion factor is 2.22 counts per minute per Becquerel (cpm/Bq):\n\nMDA = G / k\nMDA = 615 / 2.22\nMDA ≈ 277 Bq\n\nSo, the minimum detectable activity of the Geiger-Muller detector for beta particles with an energy of 0.5 MeV, assuming a counting efficiency of 20% and a background count rate of 100 counts per minute, is approximately 277 Becquerels."
