    "message_2": "To determine the bond order and bond length of the N-O bond in the nitrite ion (NO2-), we need to consider its resonance structures and molecular orbital theory.\n\nResonance structures of NO2-:\n\n1. O = N - O^-\n2. O^- - N = O\n\nIn both resonance structures, there is one single bond and one double bond between the nitrogen and oxygen atoms. The actual structure of the nitrite ion is a hybrid of these two resonance structures, meaning that the bond order is an average of the single and double bonds.\n\nBond order = (Number of electrons in bonding orbitals - Number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\n\nFor NO2-, there are 2 electrons in the σ bonding orbital, 4 electrons in the π bonding orbitals, and 2 electrons in the σ* antibonding orbital.\n\nBond order = (2 + 4 - 2) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2\n\nHowever, since there are two N-O bonds, we need to divide this bond order by 2 to get the average bond order for each N-O bond.\n\nAverage bond order = 2 / 2 = 1.5\n\nThe bond order of the N-O bond in the nitrite ion (NO2-) is 1.5.\n\nAs for the bond length, it is inversely proportional to the bond order. A higher bond order indicates a shorter bond length, and a lower bond order indicates a longer bond length. In the case of NO2-, the bond length of the N-O bond will be between that of a single bond and a double bond.\n\nExperimentally determined bond lengths for NO2- are approximately 1.21 Å (angstroms)."
