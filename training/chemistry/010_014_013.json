    "message_2": "To calculate the mass of silver deposited on the cathode during electrolysis, we can use Faraday's laws of electrolysis. \n\nFirst, we need to determine the total charge (Q) passed through the solution. We can do this using the formula:\n\nQ = I × t\n\nwhere Q is the total charge, I is the current (in amperes), and t is the time (in seconds).\n\nGiven:\nI = 2.5 A\nt = 3 hours = 3 × 3600 seconds = 10800 seconds\n\nNow, we can calculate the total charge:\n\nQ = 2.5 A × 10800 s = 27000 Coulombs\n\nNext, we need to find the number of moles of electrons (n) transferred during the electrolysis. We can do this using Faraday's constant (F), which is approximately 96485 Coulombs per mole of electrons:\n\nn = Q / F\n\nn = 27000 C / 96485 C/mol ≈ 0.2798 mol of electrons\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of moles of silver (Ag) deposited on the cathode. Silver has a valency of 1, meaning one mole of electrons will deposit one mole of silver:\n\nmoles of Ag = 0.2798 mol\n\nFinally, we can calculate the mass of silver deposited using the molar mass of silver (Ag), which is 107.87 g/mol:\n\nmass of Ag = moles of Ag × molar mass of Ag\n\nmass of Ag = 0.2798 mol × 107.87 g/mol ≈ 30.16 g\n\nSo, approximately 30.16 grams of silver will be deposited on the cathode during the electrolysis."
