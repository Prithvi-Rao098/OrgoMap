    "message_2": "Based on the given NMR spectrum and molecular formula (C7H14O2), we can deduce the structure of the unknown organic compound as follows:\n\n1. The chemical shift at 0.87 ppm (3H, s) and 1.25 ppm (3H, s) indicates the presence of two methyl groups (CH3) in the compound.\n2. The chemical shift at 1.45 ppm (2H, m) suggests the presence of a methylene group (CH2) adjacent to a heteroatom (O or N).\n3. The chemical shift at 2.10 ppm (2H, t) indicates another methylene group (CH2) adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n4. The chemical shift at 2.80 ppm (1H, br s) suggests the presence of an alcohol group (OH) in the compound.\n5. The chemical shift at 4.00 ppm (1H, t) indicates a methine group (CH) adjacent to an oxygen atom.\n6. The chemical shift at 4.20 ppm (1H, br s) suggests the presence of another alcohol group (OH) in the compound.\n7. The chemical shift at 9.70 ppm (1H, s) indicates the presence of an aldehyde group (CHO) in the compound.\n\nTaking all these observations into account, the structure of the unknown organic compound can be deduced as:\n\nCH3CH2CH(OH)CH2C(=O)CH(OH)CH3\n\nThis compound is 2,5-dihydroxyheptanal, which is consistent with the given molecular formula (C7H14O2) and the NMR spectrum."
