    "message_2": "To identify the type of bonding in a given solid, you can examine several properties that can help distinguish between ionic, covalent, and metallic bonding. Here are three specific properties:\n\n1. Electrical conductivity: Ionic solids typically do not conduct electricity in their solid state but become good conductors when dissolved in water or melted. Covalent solids are generally poor conductors of electricity in any state. Metallic solids are good conductors of electricity in their solid state due to the presence of a \"sea\" of delocalized electrons.\n\n2. Melting and boiling points: Ionic solids usually have high melting and boiling points due to the strong electrostatic forces between the positively and negatively charged ions. Covalent solids have a wide range of melting and boiling points, depending on the strength of the covalent bonds. Metallic solids have moderate to high melting and boiling points due to the strong metallic bonds.\n\n3. Hardness and brittleness: Ionic solids are generally hard and brittle, as the strong ionic bonds make them rigid, but they can break under stress. Covalent solids can be either very hard (e.g., diamond) or relatively soft (e.g., graphite) depending on the arrangement of the covalent bonds. Metallic solids are usually malleable and ductile due to the non-directional nature of metallic bonds, which allows the atoms to slide past each other without breaking the bonds.\n\nExamples of materials that exhibit each type of bonding:\n\n- Ionic bonding: Sodium chloride (NaCl), magnesium oxide (MgO), and calcium fluoride (CaF2) are examples of ionic solids.\n- Covalent bonding: Diamond (carbon in a tetrahedral lattice), quartz (silicon dioxide, SiO2), and graphite (carbon in a hexagonal lattice) are examples of covalent solids.\n- Metallic bonding: Metals such as copper (Cu), iron (Fe), and gold (Au) are examples of metallic solids."
