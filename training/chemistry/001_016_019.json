    "message_2": "This reaction is an acid-catalyzed substitution reaction, where ethanol (CH3CH2OH) reacts with hydrobromic acid (HBr) to form bromoethane (CH3CH2Br) and water (H2O). The major intermediate in this reaction is the formation of a carbocation. Here is the proposed mechanism:\n\nStep 1: Protonation of the alcohol\nThe lone pair of electrons on the oxygen atom of ethanol attacks the hydrogen atom of HBr, forming a bond with it. This results in the formation of an oxonium ion (protonated ethanol) and a bromide ion (Br-).\n\nCH3CH2OH + HBr → CH3CH2OH2+ + Br-\n\nStep 2: Formation of carbocation\nThe oxonium ion (CH3CH2OH2+) is unstable and undergoes heterolysis, where the bond between the oxygen and the carbon atom breaks. The electrons in the bond move to the oxygen atom, resulting in the formation of a carbocation (CH3CH2+) and a water molecule (H2O).\n\nCH3CH2OH2+ → CH3CH2+ + H2O\n\nStep 3: Nucleophilic attack\nThe bromide ion (Br-) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbocation (CH3CH2+), forming a bond with the carbon atom. This results in the formation of bromoethane (CH3CH2Br).\n\nCH3CH2+ + Br- → CH3CH2Br\n\nOverall, the major intermediate in this reaction is the carbocation (CH3CH2+), and the mechanism involves protonation of the alcohol, formation of a carbocation, and nucleophilic attack by the bromide ion."
