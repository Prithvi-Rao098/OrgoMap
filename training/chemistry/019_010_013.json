    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of hydrogen gas, we can use the following formula:\n\nΔH° = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH° is the standard enthalpy change, and ΔHf° is the standard enthalpy of formation.\n\nFor the given balanced chemical equation:\n\n2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(l)\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation for liquid water (H2O) is given as -285.8 kJ/mol. The standard enthalpy of formation for elemental hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) in their standard states is 0 kJ/mol.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nΔH° = [2 × (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [2 × 0 kJ/mol + 1 × 0 kJ/mol]\n\nΔH° = (-571.6 kJ) - 0\n\nΔH° = -571.6 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the combustion of hydrogen gas is -571.6 kJ."
