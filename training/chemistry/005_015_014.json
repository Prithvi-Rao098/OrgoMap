    "message_2": "The complete oxidation of one molecule of glucose through glycolysis, the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle), and oxidative phosphorylation can produce a theoretical maximum of 38 ATP molecules. However, in eukaryotic cells, the actual number is typically around 30-32 ATP molecules due to the energy cost of transporting NADH and FADH2 into the mitochondria. Here's a breakdown of ATP production:\n\n1. Glycolysis: \n- 2 ATP molecules are consumed, and 4 ATP molecules are produced, resulting in a net gain of 2 ATP.\n- 2 NADH molecules are produced, which can generate 5-6 ATP molecules through oxidative phosphorylation (2.5-3 ATP per NADH).\n\n2. Pyruvate decarboxylation (transition step):\n- 2 NADH molecules are produced (one per pyruvate), which can generate 5-6 ATP molecules through oxidative phosphorylation (2.5-3 ATP per NADH).\n\n3. Citric Acid Cycle:\n- 2 ATP molecules are produced (one per cycle, as two cycles occur for each glucose molecule).\n- 6 NADH molecules are produced, which can generate 15-18 ATP molecules through oxidative phosphorylation (2.5-3 ATP per NADH).\n- 2 FADH2 molecules are produced, which can generate 3-4 ATP molecules through oxidative phosphorylation (1.5-2 ATP per FADH2).\n\nAdding these up, we get a total of 30-32 ATP molecules produced by the complete oxidation of one molecule of glucose in eukaryotic cells. In prokaryotic cells, the theoretical maximum of 38 ATP molecules can be achieved as there is no energy cost for transporting NADH and FADH2 across the membrane."
