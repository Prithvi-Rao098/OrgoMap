    "message_2": "To determine the maximum yield of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid, we need to use stoichiometry. First, we need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nC7H6O2 (benzoic acid) + 2 HNO3 (nitric acid) → C7H4N2O6 (2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid) + 2 H2O (water)\n\nNow, we need to find the molar masses of benzoic acid and 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid:\n\nBenzoic acid (C7H6O2): (7 × 12.01) + (6 × 1.01) + (2 × 16.00) = 122.12 g/mol\n2,4-Dinitrobenzoic acid (C7H4N2O6): (7 × 12.01) + (4 × 1.01) + (2 × 14.01) + (6 × 16.00) = 212.14 g/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the moles of benzoic acid in the given 5 grams:\n\nmoles of benzoic acid = mass / molar mass = 5 g / 122.12 g/mol = 0.0409 mol\n\nAccording to the balanced chemical equation, 1 mole of benzoic acid reacts to form 1 mole of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid. Therefore, 0.0409 moles of benzoic acid will produce 0.0409 moles of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid.\n\nNow, we can calculate the mass of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid produced:\n\nmass of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid = moles × molar mass = 0.0409 mol × 212.14 g/mol = 8.67 g\n\nSo, the maximum yield of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid that can be obtained from 5 grams of benzoic acid and excess nitric acid is 8.67 grams."
