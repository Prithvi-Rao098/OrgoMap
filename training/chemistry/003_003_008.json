    "message_2": "For a first-order reaction, the rate law is given by:\n\nrate = k[A]\n\nwhere rate is the initial rate of reaction, k is the rate constant, and [A] is the initial concentration of the reactant (in this case, hydrogen peroxide).\n\nWe are given the initial rate of reaction (6.26 x 10^-4 M/s) and the initial concentration of hydrogen peroxide (0.050 M). We can rearrange the rate law equation to solve for the rate constant, k:\n\nk = rate / [A]\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\nk = (6.26 x 10^-4 M/s) / (0.050 M)\n\nk â‰ˆ 1.252 x 10^-2 s^-1\n\nThe rate constant for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen gas is approximately 1.252 x 10^-2 s^-1."
