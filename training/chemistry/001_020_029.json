    "message_2": "The electrophilic addition of hydrogen bromide (HBr) to propene (C3H6) is a two-step reaction mechanism that involves the formation of a carbocation intermediate. The reaction proceeds as follows:\n\nStep 1: Protonation of the alkene\nIn the first step, the alkene (propene) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic hydrogen atom of HBr. This leads to the breaking of the H-Br bond, with the electrons moving towards the bromine atom. As a result, a carbocation intermediate is formed, and a bromide ion (Br-) is generated. According to Markovnikov's rule, the hydrogen atom will attach to the carbon with the least number of hydrogen atoms (in this case, the central carbon), forming a secondary carbocation.\n\nPropene + HBr → [CH3-CH(+)-CH3] + Br-\n\nStep 2: Nucleophilic attack by bromide ion\nIn the second step, the bromide ion (Br-) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the positively charged carbon atom of the carbocation intermediate. This leads to the formation of the final product, 2-bromopropane.\n\n[CH3-CH(+)-CH3] + Br- → CH3-CH(Br)-CH3\n\nStereochemistry of the product:\nThe electrophilic addition of HBr to propene results in the formation of 2-bromopropane. Since the reaction occurs at a sp3 hybridized carbon atom, the product will be a chiral molecule. However, the reaction is not stereoselective, and both R and S enantiomers of 2-bromopropane will be formed in equal amounts, resulting in a racemic mixture."
