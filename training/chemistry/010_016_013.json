    "message_2": "To calculate the polarization resistance (Rp) of the copper electrode, we can use the following equation:\n\nRp = (dE/di) = (Tafel slope) / (n * F * exchange current density)\n\nwhere dE is the change in potential, di is the change in current density, n is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction (n = 2 for copper), F is the Faraday constant (F = 96485 C/mol), and the exchange current density is given as 0.1 mA/cm².\n\nFirst, we need to convert the Tafel slope from mV/decade to V/decade:\n\nTafel slope = 30 mV/decade * (1 V/1000 mV) = 0.03 V/decade\n\nNext, we need to find the overpotential (η) using the Tafel equation:\n\nη = Tafel slope * log10(current density / exchange current density)\n\nη = 0.03 V/decade * log10(10 mA/cm² / 0.1 mA/cm²)\nη = 0.03 V/decade * log10(100)\nη = 0.03 V/decade * 2\nη = 0.06 V\n\nNow we can calculate the polarization resistance:\n\nRp = (dE/di) = (Tafel slope) / (n * F * exchange current density)\nRp = (0.06 V) / (2 * 96485 C/mol * 0.1 mA/cm² * (1 A/1000 mA) * (1 mol/96485 C))\nRp = (0.06 V) / (2 * 0.1 A/cm²)\nRp = 0.06 V / 0.2 A/cm²\nRp = 0.3 Ωcm²\n\nThe polarization resistance of the copper electrode in a 0.1 M copper sulfate solution at 25°C is 0.3 Ωcm²."
