    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy change for the formation of one mole of water (H2O, l) from its elements, we can use the given reactions and their enthalpy changes. \n\nFirst, we need to find the enthalpy change for the formation of one mole of water (H2O, g) from its elements. The second reaction gives the enthalpy change for the formation of two moles of water (H2O, g):\n\n2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(g)       ∆H = -483.6 kJ/mol\n\nDivide the enthalpy change by 2 to find the enthalpy change for the formation of one mole of water (H2O, g):\n\n∆H = -483.6 kJ/mol / 2 = -241.8 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we need to find the enthalpy change for the conversion of one mole of water (H2O, g) to one mole of water (H2O, l). The third reaction is:\n\nH2O(l) → H2O(g)                 ∆H = 40.7 kJ/mol\n\nTo reverse the reaction, we need to change the sign of the enthalpy change:\n\nH2O(g) → H2O(l)                 ∆H = -40.7 kJ/mol\n\nFinally, we can add the enthalpy changes for the formation of one mole of water (H2O, g) and the conversion of one mole of water (H2O, g) to one mole of water (H2O, l):\n\n∆H (H2O, g) = -241.8 kJ/mol\n∆H (H2O, g to H2O, l) = -40.7 kJ/mol\n\n∆H (H2O, l) = -241.8 kJ/mol + (-40.7 kJ/mol) = -282.5 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the formation of one mole of water (H2O, l) from its elements at 298 K and 1 bar is -282.5 kJ/mol."
