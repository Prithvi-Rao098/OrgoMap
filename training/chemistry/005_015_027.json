    "message_2": "During the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle), one molecule of acetyl-CoA generates:\n\n- 3 molecules of NADH\n- 1 molecule of FADH2\n- 1 molecule of GTP (which can be converted to ATP)\n\nThe NADH and FADH2 molecules produced in the citric acid cycle are used in the electron transport chain to generate ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. The number of ATP molecules produced per NADH and FADH2 varies slightly depending on the organism and specific conditions, but a common estimate is:\n\n- 2.5 ATP molecules per NADH\n- 1.5 ATP molecules per FADH2\n\nUsing these estimates, the net number of ATP molecules produced through oxidative phosphorylation during the citric acid cycle for one acetyl-CoA molecule is:\n\n(3 NADH × 2.5 ATP/NADH) + (1 FADH2 × 1.5 ATP/FADH2) + 1 GTP = 10 ATP molecules"
