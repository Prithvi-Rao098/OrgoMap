    "message_2": "To calculate the bond length between two carbon atoms in a molecule of ethene, we need to know the covalent radius of a carbon atom. The covalent radius of a carbon atom is approximately 77 pm (picometers).\n\nUsing the empirical formula for calculating bond length, we have:\n\nBond length = sum of covalent radii of the two atoms\n\nSince both atoms are carbon, we can simply add their covalent radii together:\n\nBond length = 77 pm (covalent radius of carbon) + 77 pm (covalent radius of carbon)\nBond length = 154 pm\n\nHowever, the bond order of the carbon-carbon bond in ethene is 1.5, which means it is a combination of a single bond and a double bond. To account for this, we can take the average of the bond lengths for a single bond and a double bond.\n\nThe bond length for a carbon-carbon single bond is approximately 154 pm, and the bond length for a carbon-carbon double bond is approximately 134 pm.\n\nAverage bond length = (single bond length + double bond length) / 2\nAverage bond length = (154 pm + 134 pm) / 2\nAverage bond length = 288 pm / 2\nAverage bond length = 144 pm\n\nSo, the bond length between two carbon atoms in a molecule of ethene, assuming a carbon-carbon bond order of 1.5, is approximately 144 pm."
