    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the complete combustion of 5 grams of methane gas (CH4), we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the combustion reaction:\n\nCH4 (g) + 2 O2 (g) → CO2 (g) + 2 H2O (g)\n\nNext, we need to find the enthalpy of formation for CO2. The enthalpy of formation for CO2 is -393.5 kJ/mol.\n\nNow, we can use Hess's Law to calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nΔH = [ΔHf (CO2) + 2 * ΔHf (H2O)] - ΔHf (CH4)\n\nΔH = [(-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 * (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - (-74.8 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH = (-393.5 - 571.6 + 74.8) kJ/mol\n\nΔH = -890.3 kJ/mol\n\nNow we need to find the number of moles of methane in 5 grams:\n\nMoles of CH4 = mass / molar mass\n\nMoles of CH4 = 5 g / (12.01 g/mol (C) + 4.03 g/mol (H))\n\nMoles of CH4 = 5 g / 16.04 g/mol\n\nMoles of CH4 = 0.3118 mol\n\nFinally, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of 5 grams of methane:\n\nΔH = -890.3 kJ/mol * 0.3118 mol\n\nΔH = -277.4 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change for the complete combustion of 5 grams of methane gas is approximately -277.4 kJ."
