    "message_2": "To determine the limiting reactant and the amount of ammonia produced, we need to use stoichiometry. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction between nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas to produce ammonia gas is:\n\nN₂(g) + 3H₂(g) → 2NH₃(g)\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of each reactant:\n\nMolar mass of N₂ = 28 g/mol\nMolar mass of H₂ = 2 g/mol\n\nMoles of N₂ = 5 g / 28 g/mol = 0.1786 mol\nMoles of H₂ = 10 g / 2 g/mol = 5 mol\n\nNow, we need to find the mole ratio between the reactants:\n\nMole ratio of N₂ to H₂ = 1:3\n\nNext, we need to compare the actual mole ratio to the balanced equation's mole ratio:\n\nActual mole ratio of N₂ to H₂ = 0.1786 mol N₂ / 5 mol H₂ = 0.0357\n\nSince the actual mole ratio (0.0357) is less than the balanced equation's mole ratio (1/3), nitrogen gas (N₂) is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow, we can calculate the amount of ammonia produced using the stoichiometry of the balanced equation:\n\nMoles of NH₃ produced = 0.1786 mol N₂ * (2 mol NH₃ / 1 mol N₂) = 0.3572 mol NH₃\n\nFinally, we can convert the moles of ammonia to grams:\n\nMolar mass of NH₃ = 17 g/mol\n\nMass of NH₃ produced = 0.3572 mol NH₃ * 17 g/mol = 6.07 g\n\nSo, the limiting reactant is nitrogen gas (N₂), and 6.07 grams of ammonia can be produced from the given quantity of reactants."
