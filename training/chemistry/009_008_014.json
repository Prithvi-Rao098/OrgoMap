    "message_2": "To find the minimum detectable activity (MDA) of a gamma-ray detector, we need to consider the efficiency of the detector and the specific activity of the radioactive sample.\n\nEfficiency (ε) = 20% = 0.20\nSpecific activity (A_s) = 200 Bq/g\n\nThe minimum detectable activity (MDA) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nMDA = A_s / ε\n\nMDA = 200 Bq/g / 0.20\n\nMDA = 1000 Bq/g\n\nThe minimum detectable activity of the gamma-ray detector is 1000 Bq/g."
