    "message_2": "To calculate the activation energy (Ea) for the chemical reaction, we can use the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk = A * e^(-Ea / RT)\n\nwhere k is the rate constant (2.5 × 10^-3 s^-1), A is the frequency factor (5 × 10^13 s^-1), R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol K), and T is the temperature (298 K).\n\nFirst, we need to isolate Ea in the equation:\n\nk / A = e^(-Ea / RT)\n\nNow, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(k / A) = -Ea / RT\n\nNext, multiply both sides by -RT:\n\nEa = -RT * ln(k / A)\n\nNow, plug in the values:\n\nEa = - (8.314 J/mol K) * (298 K) * ln((2.5 × 10^-3 s^-1) / (5 × 10^13 s^-1))\n\nEa ≈ 96452.5 J/mol\n\nThe activation energy for the chemical reaction is approximately 96,452.5 J/mol."
