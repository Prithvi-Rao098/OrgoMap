    "message_2": "Ozone (O3) has a molecular geometry known as bent or V-shaped. The central oxygen atom is bonded to two other oxygen atoms, and there is also a lone pair of electrons on the central oxygen atom. This gives the central oxygen atom a total of three electron groups, which corresponds to a trigonal planar electron geometry. However, due to the presence of the lone pair, the molecular geometry is bent.\n\nThe approximate bond angle in the ozone molecule is around 116.8°, which is slightly smaller than the ideal bond angle of 120° in a trigonal planar electron geometry. This deviation from the ideal bond angle is due to the repulsion between the lone pair and the bonding pairs of electrons, causing the bonding pairs to be pushed closer together."
