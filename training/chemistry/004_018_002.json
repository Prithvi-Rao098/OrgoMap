    "message_1": "A chemistry student wants to determine the percent composition of calcium oxide in a given sample of limestone. The student does an experiment and obtains the mass of the limestone sample, the mass of carbon dioxide evolved upon heating the limestone, and the mass of calcium oxide left behind. Using mass balance calculations, determine the percent composition of calcium oxide in the limestone sample.",
    "message_2": "To determine the percent composition of calcium oxide (CaO) in the limestone sample, we will use the mass balance calculations. Let's assume the student has provided the following data:\n\nMass of limestone sample (m_limestone) = x grams\nMass of carbon dioxide evolved (m_CO2) = y grams\nMass of calcium oxide left behind (m_CaO) = z grams\n\nLimestone is primarily composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). When it is heated, it undergoes a decomposition reaction to form calcium oxide (CaO) and carbon dioxide (CO2):\n\nCaCO3 (s) → CaO (s) + CO2 (g)\n\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, the mass of the limestone sample should be equal to the sum of the masses of the products formed:\n\nm_limestone = m_CaO + m_CO2\n\nNow, we have the mass of calcium oxide (m_CaO) and the mass of the limestone sample (m_limestone). To find the percent composition of calcium oxide in the limestone sample, we can use the following formula:\n\nPercent composition of CaO = (m_CaO / m_limestone) × 100%\n\nPlug in the given values:\n\nPercent composition of CaO = (z / x) × 100%\n\nNow, calculate the percent composition using the provided values for z and x."
