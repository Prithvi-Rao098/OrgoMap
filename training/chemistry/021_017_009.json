    "message_2": "In a sample of nitrogen gas (N2) at room temperature and pressure, the primary intermolecular force present is London dispersion forces (also known as van der Waals forces or induced dipole-induced dipole interactions). These forces arise due to the temporary fluctuations in electron distribution around the nitrogen molecules, which create temporary dipoles that attract or repel other nearby molecules.\n\nNitrogen gas does not exhibit hydrogen bonding or dipole-dipole interactions because it is a nonpolar molecule composed of two nitrogen atoms covalently bonded together with a triple bond, resulting in a symmetrical and nonpolar molecular structure."
