    "message_2": "To improve the suitability of liquid crystals for use in display technology, we can modify their molecular structure in several ways. These modifications can enhance properties such as response time, temperature stability, and color performance. Here are some strategies to achieve these improvements:\n\n1. Altering the molecular shape: The molecular shape of liquid crystals plays a crucial role in determining their properties. By synthesizing liquid crystals with different molecular shapes, such as bent-core or banana-shaped molecules, we can influence their alignment and phase behavior, leading to improved performance in display technology.\n\n2. Introducing functional groups: The introduction of functional groups, such as fluorine or cyano groups, can enhance the dielectric properties and stability of liquid crystals. These functional groups can also improve the electro-optical response, leading to faster switching times and better overall performance.\n\n3. Designing chiral liquid crystals: Chiral liquid crystals exhibit unique optical properties, such as selective reflection of light and the ability to form helical structures. By incorporating chiral centers into the molecular structure, we can create liquid crystals with improved color performance and tunable optical properties.\n\n4. Modifying the mesogenic core: The mesogenic core is the central part of the liquid crystal molecule that determines its phase behavior. By modifying the mesogenic core, we can create liquid crystals with a wider temperature range, improved stability, and better electro-optical properties.\n\n5. Introducing photoresponsive or thermoresponsive groups: Incorporating photoresponsive (e.g., azobenzene) or thermoresponsive (e.g., biphenyl) groups into the molecular structure allows for the control of liquid crystal properties through external stimuli such as light or temperature. This can lead to the development of advanced display technologies with dynamic and adaptive properties.\n\n6. Developing polymer-stabilized liquid crystals: Combining liquid crystals with polymer networks can improve their mechanical stability and reduce the impact of external factors such as temperature and humidity. Polymer-stabilized liquid crystals can also exhibit faster response times and better contrast ratios, making them more suitable for display applications.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, we can modify the molecular structure of liquid crystals to improve their suitability for use in display technology, leading to better performance, enhanced stability, and more advanced functionalities."
