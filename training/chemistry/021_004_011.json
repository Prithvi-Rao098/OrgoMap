    "message_2": "The hybridization of the nitrogen atom in ammonia (NH3) is sp3. In ammonia, the nitrogen atom forms three sigma bonds with three hydrogen atoms and has one lone pair of electrons. This requires four orbitals, which are formed by the hybridization of one 2s orbital and three 2p orbitals, resulting in four sp3 hybrid orbitals."
