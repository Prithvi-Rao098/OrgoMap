    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH°(reaction) = Σ ΔH°f(products) - Σ ΔH°f(reactants)\n\nIn this case, the reactants are N2(g) and H2(g), and the product is NH3(g). The standard enthalpy of formation for elements in their standard states (N2 and H2) is zero. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\nΔH°(reaction) = [2 × ΔH°f(NH3)] - [ΔH°f(N2) + 3 × ΔH°f(H2)]\n\nGiven that the standard enthalpy of formation of NH3(g) is -46.1 kJ mol-1:\n\nΔH°(reaction) = [2 × (-46.1 kJ mol-1)] - [0 + 3 × 0]\n\nΔH°(reaction) = -92.2 kJ mol-1\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change for the reaction N2(g) + 3H2(g) → 2NH3(g) at 298 K is -92.2 kJ mol-1."
