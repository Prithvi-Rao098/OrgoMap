    "message_1": "A student synthesized a new compound by reacting magnesium with oxygen. The mass of magnesium used in the reaction was 0.25 grams and the mass of the resulting compound was 0.73 grams. Determine the empirical formula of the compound.",
    "message_2": "To determine the empirical formula of the compound, we need to find the mole ratio of magnesium to oxygen in the compound. \n\n1. Calculate the moles of magnesium used in the reaction:\nMagnesium has a molar mass of 24.31 g/mol.\nmoles of Mg = mass of Mg / molar mass of Mg\nmoles of Mg = 0.25 g / 24.31 g/mol = 0.0103 mol\n\n2. Calculate the mass of oxygen in the compound:\nmass of O = mass of compound - mass of Mg\nmass of O = 0.73 g - 0.25 g = 0.48 g\n\n3. Calculate the moles of oxygen in the compound:\nOxygen has a molar mass of 16.00 g/mol.\nmoles of O = mass of O / molar mass of O\nmoles of O = 0.48 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.0300 mol\n\n4. Determine the mole ratio of magnesium to oxygen:\nDivide the moles of each element by the smallest number of moles to find the simplest whole number ratio.\nMg:O ratio = (0.0103 mol / 0.0103 mol) : (0.0300 mol / 0.0103 mol) = 1:2.91\n\nSince the ratio is close to a whole number ratio of 1:3, we can round it to the nearest whole number.\n\n5. Write the empirical formula:\nThe empirical formula of the compound is MgOâ‚ƒ."
