    "message_2": "The electrophilic addition reaction of HBr with propene involves a two-step mechanism. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the mechanism:\n\nStep 1: Protonation of the alkene (formation of carbocation)\n1. Propene (CH3-CH=CH2) acts as a nucleophile due to the presence of the electron-rich double bond (C=C).\n2. HBr acts as an electrophile because the hydrogen atom (H) is slightly positive (δ+) due to the polar bond between H and Br.\n3. The electron-rich double bond of propene attacks the slightly positive hydrogen atom of HBr, breaking the H-Br bond and forming a new C-H bond.\n4. This results in the formation of a carbocation intermediate, as one of the carbon atoms loses its share of electrons from the double bond and becomes positively charged. In this case, a secondary carbocation is formed (CH3-CH(+)-CH3) because it is more stable than the primary carbocation.\n\nStep 2: Nucleophilic attack by bromide ion (formation of the final product)\n1. The negatively charged bromide ion (Br-) that was generated in the first step acts as a nucleophile.\n2. The bromide ion attacks the positively charged carbon atom of the carbocation intermediate, forming a new C-Br bond.\n3. The final product is 2-bromopropane (CH3-CH(Br)-CH3), which is formed through the electrophilic addition of HBr to propene.\n\nOverall reaction: CH3-CH=CH2 + HBr → CH3-CH(Br)-CH3"
