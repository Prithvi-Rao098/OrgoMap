    "message_1": "How many millimoles of hydrazine are needed to react with 2 grams of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene to produce the maximum amount of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use stoichiometry. First, we need to find the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between hydrazine (N2H4) and 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (C6H3ClN2O4) to produce 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (C6H6N4O4).\n\nThe balanced chemical equation is:\n\nC6H3ClN2O4 + N2H4 → C6H6N4O4 + HCl\n\nNow, we need to find the molar mass of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene and hydrazine:\n\nMolar mass of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene = 202.56 g/mol (1 carbon = 12.01, 6 hydrogen = 1.01, 1 chlorine = 35.45, 2 nitrogen = 14.01, and 4 oxygen = 16.00)\nMolar mass of hydrazine = 32.05 g/mol (2 nitrogen = 14.01 and 4 hydrogen = 1.01)\n\nNext, we need to find the moles of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene:\n\nmoles of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene = mass / molar mass = 2 g / 202.56 g/mol = 0.00987 mol\n\nAccording to the balanced chemical equation, 1 mole of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene reacts with 1 mole of hydrazine. Therefore, the moles of hydrazine needed are the same as the moles of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene:\n\nmoles of hydrazine = 0.00987 mol\n\nTo convert moles to millimoles, we multiply by 1000:\n\nmillimoles of hydrazine = 0.00987 mol × 1000 = 9.87 mmol\n\nSo, 9.87 millimoles of hydrazine are needed to react with 2 grams of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene to produce the maximum amount of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine."
