    "message_2": "To find the rate of reaction, we can use the following formula:\n\nRate of reaction = (change in concentration of product or reactant) / (time taken for the change)\n\nIn this case, we are given that 2 moles of water vapor are produced in 10 seconds. So, the change in concentration of the product (water vapor) is 2 moles. The time taken for the change is 10 seconds.\n\nRate of reaction = (2 moles) / (10 seconds) = 0.2 moles/second\n\nThe rate of reaction between 3 moles of hydrogen gas and 2 moles of oxygen gas when ignited is 0.2 moles/second."
