    "message_1": "What is the pH of a solution obtained by mixing 100 mL of 0.1 M HCl with 200 mL of 0.05 M NaOH? (Assuming complete reaction and volume of resulting solution as 300 mL).",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to first find the moles of HCl and NaOH, then determine the moles of the resulting solution after the reaction, and finally calculate the pH.\n\n1. Calculate the moles of HCl and NaOH:\nMoles of HCl = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 M × 0.1 L = 0.01 moles\nMoles of NaOH = Molarity × Volume = 0.05 M × 0.2 L = 0.01 moles\n\n2. Determine the moles of the resulting solution after the reaction:\nSince HCl and NaOH react in a 1:1 ratio, they will completely neutralize each other, forming water and NaCl. Therefore, there will be no excess HCl or NaOH in the solution.\n\n3. Calculate the pH:\nSince there is no excess HCl or NaOH in the solution, the solution is neutral, and the pH is 7."
