    "message_1": "If the formation of the complex ion Cu(NH3)42+ in a solution is endothermic, what will happen to the equilibrium concentration of the ion when the temperature is increased? Provide a mathematical explanation to support your answer, assuming all other factors remain constant.",
    "message_2": "When the temperature is increased in an endothermic reaction, the equilibrium will shift towards the products to absorb the excess heat. In this case, the formation of the complex ion Cu(NH3)42+ is endothermic, so increasing the temperature will shift the equilibrium towards the formation of more Cu(NH3)42+ ions.\n\nMathematically, this can be explained using Le Chatelier's principle and the Van't Hoff equation. Le Chatelier's principle states that when a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in temperature, pressure, or concentration of reactants or products, the system will adjust the position of the equilibrium to counteract the change.\n\nThe Van't Hoff equation relates the change in temperature to the equilibrium constant (K) of a reaction:\n\nln(K2/K1) = -ΔH°/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere K1 and K2 are the equilibrium constants at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively, ΔH° is the standard enthalpy change of the reaction, R is the gas constant, and T1 and T2 are the initial and final temperatures in Kelvin.\n\nSince the reaction is endothermic, ΔH° is positive. When the temperature is increased (T2 > T1), the term (1/T2 - 1/T1) becomes negative. Therefore, the left side of the equation, ln(K2/K1), will also be negative, which means that K2 < K1. This indicates that the equilibrium constant has increased with the increase in temperature.\n\nAs the equilibrium constant (K) is directly proportional to the concentration of products, an increase in K means that the equilibrium concentration of the complex ion Cu(NH3)42+ will also increase. This is consistent with Le Chatelier's principle, as the system shifts towards the products to absorb the excess heat."
