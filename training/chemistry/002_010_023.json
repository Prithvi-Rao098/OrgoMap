    "message_2": "To find the density of the iron(III) oxide sample, we can use the formula:\n\nDensity = Mass / Volume\n\nGiven the mass (m) is 10.0 grams and the volume (V) is 5.0 mL, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nDensity = (10.0 grams) / (5.0 mL)\n\nDensity = 2.0 grams/mL\n\nThe density of the iron(III) oxide sample is 2.0 grams/mL."
