    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the isomerization reaction of butene-1 to cis-2-butene, we can use the following formula:\n\nΔH_reaction = ΔH_f(products) - ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nIn this case, the reactant is butene-1 and the product is cis-2-butene. We are given the standard enthalpy of formation for both butene-1 and cis-2-butene:\n\nΔH_f(butene-1) = -19.8 kJ/mol\nΔH_f(cis-2-butene) = -20.4 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nΔH_reaction = (-20.4 kJ/mol) - (-19.8 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH_reaction = -0.6 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy change for the isomerization reaction of butene-1 to cis-2-butene is -0.6 kJ/mol."
