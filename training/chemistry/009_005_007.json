    "message_2": "To calculate the binding energy of Oxygen-16 nucleus, we need to find the mass defect first. The mass defect is the difference between the mass of the nucleus and the sum of the masses of its individual protons and neutrons.\n\nOxygen-16 has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. The mass of a proton is approximately 1.007276 amu, and the mass of a neutron is approximately 1.008665 amu.\n\nTotal mass of 8 protons = 8 * 1.007276 amu = 8.058208 amu\nTotal mass of 8 neutrons = 8 * 1.008665 amu = 8.069320 amu\n\nSum of the masses of protons and neutrons = 8.058208 amu + 8.069320 amu = 16.127528 amu\n\nNow, we can find the mass defect:\n\nMass defect = (Sum of the masses of protons and neutrons) - (Total mass of Oxygen-16 nucleus)\nMass defect = 16.127528 amu - 16.001 amu = 0.126528 amu\n\nTo find the binding energy, we need to convert the mass defect into energy using Einstein's famous equation, E=mc². In this equation, E is the energy, m is the mass, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3.0 x 10^8 m/s). However, we need to convert the mass defect from atomic mass units (amu) to kilograms (kg) first. \n\n1 amu = 1.66054 x 10^-27 kg\n\nMass defect in kg = 0.126528 amu * (1.66054 x 10^-27 kg/amu) = 2.101 x 10^-28 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the binding energy:\n\nBinding energy (E) = (2.101 x 10^-28 kg) * (3.0 x 10^8 m/s)²\nBinding energy (E) = 1.891 x 10^-11 Joules\n\nTo express the binding energy in more convenient units, we can convert it to MeV (Mega-electron volts):\n\n1 Joule = 6.242 x 10^12 MeV\n\nBinding energy (E) = 1.891 x 10^-11 Joules * (6.242 x 10^12 MeV/Joule) = 118.1 MeV\n\nSo, the binding energy of Oxygen-16 nucleus with a total mass of 16.001 amu is approximately 118.1 MeV."
