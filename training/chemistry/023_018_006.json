    "message_2": "To find the theoretical yield of 2,4-dinitrophenol, we first need to determine the number of moles of phenol and then use stoichiometry to find the number of moles of 2,4-dinitrophenol that can be produced. Finally, we will convert the moles of 2,4-dinitrophenol to grams.\n\n1. Determine the molar mass of phenol (C6H5OH) and 2,4-dinitrophenol (C6H3N2O5):\nPhenol: (6 * 12.01) + (5 * 1.01) + 16.00 = 94.11 g/mol\n2,4-Dinitrophenol: (6 * 12.01) + (3 * 1.01) + (2 * 14.01) + (5 * 16.00) = 184.11 g/mol\n\n2. Calculate the number of moles of phenol:\nmoles of phenol = mass of phenol / molar mass of phenol\nmoles of phenol = 10 g / 94.11 g/mol = 0.1063 mol\n\n3. Use stoichiometry to find the number of moles of 2,4-dinitrophenol produced:\nSince the reaction has a 1:1 stoichiometry, the number of moles of 2,4-dinitrophenol produced is equal to the number of moles of phenol used.\nmoles of 2,4-dinitrophenol = 0.1063 mol\n\n4. Convert moles of 2,4-dinitrophenol to grams:\nmass of 2,4-dinitrophenol = moles of 2,4-dinitrophenol * molar mass of 2,4-dinitrophenol\nmass of 2,4-dinitrophenol = 0.1063 mol * 184.11 g/mol = 19.56 g\n\nThe theoretical yield of 2,4-dinitrophenol is 19.56 grams."
