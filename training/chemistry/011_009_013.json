    "message_2": "To calculate the energy difference between the ground state and the first excited state of a hydrogen atom, we can use the Rydberg formula for the energy levels of a hydrogen atom. The formula is:\n\nE_n = -13.6 eV * (Z^2 / n^2)\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the electron in the nth energy level, Z is the atomic number (Z = 1 for hydrogen), and n is the principal quantum number.\n\nFor the ground state (n = 1), the energy is:\n\nE_1 = -13.6 eV * (1^2 / 1^2) = -13.6 eV\n\nFor the first excited state (n = 2), the energy is:\n\nE_2 = -13.6 eV * (1^2 / 2^2) = -3.4 eV\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy difference between the ground state and the first excited state:\n\nÎ”E = E_2 - E_1 = -3.4 eV - (-13.6 eV) = 10.2 eV\n\nSo, the energy difference between the ground state and the first excited state of a hydrogen atom is 10.2 eV."
