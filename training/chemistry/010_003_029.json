    "message_2": "To calculate the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) for the electrochemical reaction, we first need to determine the standard cell potential (E°) for the reaction. This can be found by subtracting the standard electrode potential of the reduction half-reaction from the standard electrode potential of the oxidation half-reaction.\n\nThe given standard electrode potentials are:\n\nE°(Cu2+(aq) + 2e- → Cu(s)) = 0.34 V (reduction half-reaction)\nE°(Zn2+(aq) + 2e- → Zn(s)) = -0.76 V (reduction half-reaction)\n\nSince Zn is oxidized in the reaction, we need to reverse the Zn half-reaction to make it an oxidation half-reaction:\n\nE°(Zn(s) → Zn2+(aq) + 2e-) = +0.76 V (oxidation half-reaction)\n\nNow we can calculate the standard cell potential (E°) for the overall reaction:\n\nE°(cell) = E°(reduction) - E°(oxidation) = 0.34 V - (-0.76 V) = 1.10 V\n\nNext, we can use the relationship between the standard cell potential and the standard Gibbs free energy change:\n\nΔG° = -nFE°\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the reaction (in this case, 2 moles of electrons), F is Faraday's constant (96,485 C/mol), and E° is the standard cell potential.\n\nΔG° = -(2 mol)(96,485 C/mol)(1.10 V) = -212,267 J/mol\n\nSince the standard Gibbs free energy change is typically expressed in kJ/mol, we can convert the units:\n\nΔG° = -212,267 J/mol * (1 kJ/1000 J) = -212.27 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) for the electrochemical reaction of zinc and copper ions is -212.27 kJ/mol."
