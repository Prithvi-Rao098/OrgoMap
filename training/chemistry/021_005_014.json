    "message_2": "The polarity of a bond between nitrogen and oxygen in NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) can be determined by comparing their electronegativity values. Nitrogen has an electronegativity of 3.04, while oxygen has an electronegativity of 3.44. Since there is a difference in electronegativity between the two atoms, the bond between them is polar. In NO2, the nitrogen atom is bonded to two oxygen atoms, and the molecule has a bent geometry. This results in an overall polar molecule with a net dipole moment."
