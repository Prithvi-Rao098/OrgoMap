    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to first determine the moles of H+ ions from hydrochloric acid (HCl) and the moles of OH- ions from sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Then, we can find the moles of the remaining ions after the neutralization reaction and calculate the concentration of H+ ions to determine the pH of the solution.\n\n1. Calculate the moles of H+ ions from HCl:\nmoles of H+ = volume (L) × concentration (M)\nmoles of H+ = 0.025 L × 0.20 M = 0.0050 moles\n\n2. Calculate the moles of OH- ions from NaOH:\nmoles of OH- = volume (L) × concentration (M)\nmoles of OH- = 0.045 L × 0.10 M = 0.0045 moles\n\n3. Determine the moles of remaining ions after the neutralization reaction:\nSince H+ and OH- ions react in a 1:1 ratio, we can subtract the smaller number of moles from the larger number to find the remaining moles of ions.\nmoles of remaining H+ ions = 0.0050 moles - 0.0045 moles = 0.0005 moles\n\n4. Calculate the concentration of H+ ions in the final solution:\nThe total volume of the solution is 25 mL + 45 mL = 70 mL (or 0.070 L).\nconcentration of H+ ions = moles of H+ ions / total volume (L)\nconcentration of H+ ions = 0.0005 moles / 0.070 L = 0.00714 M\n\n5. Calculate the pH of the solution:\npH = -log10[H+]\npH = -log10(0.00714) ≈ 2.15\n\nThe pH of the solution formed by mixing 25 mL of 0.20 M hydrochloric acid with 45 mL of 0.10 M sodium hydroxide is approximately 2.15."
