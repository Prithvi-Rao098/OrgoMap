    "message_2": "In the complex [Fe(CN)6]4-, the central metal atom is iron (Fe).\n\nCoordination number: The coordination number is the number of ligands (in this case, cyanide ions, CN-) attached to the central metal atom. In this complex, there are six cyanide ions attached to the iron atom, so the coordination number is 6.\n\nGeometry: With a coordination number of 6, the geometry of the complex is octahedral. In an octahedral geometry, the ligands are positioned at the vertices of an octahedron around the central metal atom.\n\nOxidation state: To determine the oxidation state of the iron atom, we need to consider the charges of the ligands and the overall charge of the complex. Each cyanide ion (CN-) has a charge of -1. Since there are six cyanide ions, the total charge contributed by the ligands is -6. The overall charge of the complex is -4. Therefore, the oxidation state of the iron atom can be calculated as follows:\n\nOxidation state of Fe + (-6) = -4\nOxidation state of Fe = -4 + 6\nOxidation state of Fe = +2\n\nSo, the oxidation state of the central metal atom (iron) in the complex [Fe(CN)6]4- is +2."
