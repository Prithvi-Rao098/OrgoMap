    "message_2": "To calculate the formal charge of the nitrogen (N) atom in ammonia (NH₃), we can use the formula:\n\nFormal charge = (Valence electrons of the atom) - (Non-bonding electrons) - 0.5 * (Bonding electrons)\n\nFor nitrogen (N) in ammonia (NH₃):\n1. Valence electrons of nitrogen (N) = 5 (since nitrogen is in group 15 of the periodic table)\n2. Non-bonding electrons = 2 (there is one lone pair on nitrogen)\n3. Bonding electrons = 6 (since there are three N-H bonds, and each bond has 2 electrons)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nFormal charge of N = 5 - 2 - 0.5 * 6\nFormal charge of N = 5 - 2 - 3\nFormal charge of N = 0\n\nSo, the formal charge of the nitrogen (N) atom in the ammonia (NH₃) molecule is 0."
