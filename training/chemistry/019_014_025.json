    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the precipitation reaction, we need the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) for each compound involved in the reaction. The standard enthalpies of formation are as follows:\n\nPb(NO3)2 (aq): -379.5 kJ/mol\nNaCl (aq): -407.3 kJ/mol\nPbCl2 (s): -359.4 kJ/mol\nNaNO3 (aq): -365.6 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can use Hess's Law to calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nΔH° = [ΔHf°(products) - ΔHf°(reactants)]\n\nΔH° = [1 mol × (-359.4 kJ/mol) + 2 mol × (-365.6 kJ/mol)] - [1 mol × (-379.5 kJ/mol) + 2 mol × (-407.3 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH° = [(-359.4) + 2 × (-365.6)] - [(-379.5) + 2 × (-407.3)]\n\nΔH° = (-359.4 - 731.2) - (-379.5 - 814.6)\n\nΔH° = -1090.6 + 1194.1\n\nΔH° = 103.5 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the precipitation reaction between lead(II) nitrate and sodium chloride to form lead(II) chloride and sodium nitrate is 103.5 kJ/mol."
