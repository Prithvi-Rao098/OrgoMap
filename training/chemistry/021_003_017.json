    "message_2": "The bond angle of a methane (CH4) molecule is approximately 109.5 degrees. We can predict this using the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory.\n\nAccording to the VSEPR theory, the electron pairs around a central atom repel each other and arrange themselves in a way that minimizes this repulsion. In the case of methane, the central atom is carbon, which has four valence electrons. Each hydrogen atom has one valence electron, and they form four single covalent bonds with the carbon atom, resulting in a total of eight valence electrons around the carbon atom.\n\nSince there are four bonding electron pairs around the central carbon atom, they will arrange themselves in a tetrahedral geometry to minimize repulsion. In a tetrahedral geometry, the bond angle between any two adjacent hydrogen atoms (H-C-H) is approximately 109.5 degrees."
