Assume all heat evolved is absorbed by the iron and that the reaction occurs at constant pressure.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the reduction of iron (III) oxide using carbon in a thermite reaction, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction.\n2. Calculate the moles of iron (III) oxide and iron produced.\n3. Determine the enthalpy change for the reaction using stoichiometry and the enthalpy of formation values.\n\nStep 1: Balanced chemical equation\nFe2O3 (s) + 3C (s) → 2Fe (s) + 3CO (g)\n\nStep 2: Calculate the moles of iron (III) oxide and iron produced\nMolar mass of Fe2O3 = (2 × 55.85) + (3 × 16.00) = 111.7 + 48 = 159.7 g/mol\nMoles of Fe2O3 = mass / molar mass = 12.5 g / 159.7 g/mol = 0.0783 mol\n\nFrom the balanced equation, 1 mol of Fe2O3 produces 2 mol of Fe.\nMoles of Fe produced = 0.0783 mol × 2 = 0.1566 mol\n\nStep 3: Determine the enthalpy change for the reaction\nWe need the standard enthalpy of formation values for the reactants and products. The values are as follows:\n\nΔHf° (Fe2O3) = -824.2 kJ/mol\nΔHf° (C) = 0 kJ/mol (since it is in its standard state)\nΔHf° (Fe) = 0 kJ/mol (since it is in its standard state)\nΔHf° (CO) = -110.5 kJ/mol\n\nUsing the formula ΔH° = Σ ΔHf° (products) - Σ ΔHf° (reactants), we get:\n\nΔH° = [(2 × 0) + (3 × -110.5)] - [(1 × -824.2) + (3 × 0)]\nΔH° = [-331.5] - [-824.2]\nΔH° = 492.7 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we need to find the enthalpy change for the 0.0783 mol of Fe2O3 reacted:\n\nΔH = 0.0783 mol × 492.7 kJ/mol = 38.56 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change for the reduction of 12.5 grams of iron (III) oxide using carbon in a thermite reaction is 38.56 kJ."
