    "message_1": "What is the equilibrium constant for the reaction between ammonia and copper(II) ions to form the copper(II) ammine complex ion? The reaction equation is Cu2+ + 4NH3 ⇔ Cu(NH3)42+ and the initial concentrations of Cu2+ and NH3 are 0.010 M and 0.050 M, respectively. At equilibrium, the concentration of Cu(NH3)42+ is found to be 0.004 M. Calculate the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction, we first need to determine the equilibrium concentrations of all species involved in the reaction. We are given the initial concentrations of Cu2+ and NH3, as well as the equilibrium concentration of Cu(NH3)42+.\n\nAt equilibrium, the concentration of Cu(NH3)42+ is 0.004 M. Since the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:4, for every mole of Cu2+ that reacts, 4 moles of NH3 react as well. Therefore, the change in concentration of Cu2+ is -0.004 M, and the change in concentration of NH3 is -4 * 0.004 M = -0.016 M.\n\nNow we can find the equilibrium concentrations of Cu2+ and NH3:\n\n[Cu2+]eq = [Cu2+]initial + change in [Cu2+] = 0.010 M - 0.004 M = 0.006 M\n[NH3]eq = [NH3]initial + change in [NH3] = 0.050 M - 0.016 M = 0.034 M\n\nNow we can use the equilibrium concentrations to calculate the equilibrium constant (Kc) using the expression:\n\nKc = [Cu(NH3)42+] / ([Cu2+] * [NH3]^4)\n\nPlugging in the equilibrium concentrations:\n\nKc = (0.004 M) / ((0.006 M) * (0.034 M)^4)\n\nKc ≈ 254.5\n\nThe equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction between ammonia and copper(II) ions to form the copper(II) ammine complex ion is approximately 254.5."
