    "message_2": "The reaction between copper sulfate (CuSO₄) and sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃) is a double displacement reaction, where the cations and anions of the two reactants switch places to form new products. The products formed are copper carbonate (CuCO₃) and sodium sulfate (Na₂SO₄).\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nCuSO₄(aq) + Na₂CO₃(aq) → CuCO₃(s) + Na₂SO₄(aq)\n\nIn this reaction, copper sulfate and sodium carbonate are both in aqueous form, meaning they are dissolved in water. Copper carbonate is a solid product that precipitates out of the solution, while sodium sulfate remains dissolved in water as an aqueous product."
