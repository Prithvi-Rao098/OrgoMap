    "message_1": "What is the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the redox reaction between copper (II) ions and iodide ions, if the initial concentration of copper (II) ions is 0.15 M and the initial concentration of iodide ions is 0.20 M, and at equilibrium, the concentration of copper (II) ions is 0.11 M and the concentration of iodide ions is 0.24 M? The balanced equation for the reaction is:\n\nCu²⁺(aq) + 2I⁻(aq) ⇌ CuI(s) + I₂(aq)",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction, we first need to determine the change in concentrations for each species involved in the reaction. \n\nInitial concentrations:\n[Cu²⁺] = 0.15 M\n[I⁻] = 0.20 M\n[I₂] = 0 (since it is not mentioned)\n\nAt equilibrium:\n[Cu²⁺] = 0.11 M\n[I⁻] = 0.24 M\n\nSince the balanced equation is:\nCu²⁺(aq) + 2I⁻(aq) ⇌ CuI(s) + I₂(aq)\n\nWe can determine the change in concentrations:\nΔ[Cu²⁺] = -0.04 M\nΔ[I⁻] = +0.04 M\nΔ[I₂] = +0.02 M (since it is produced from 2 moles of I⁻)\n\nNow we can write the expression for Kc:\nKc = [I₂] / ([Cu²⁺][I⁻]^2)\n\nPlugging in the equilibrium concentrations:\nKc = (0.02) / ((0.11)(0.24)^2)\n\nKc ≈ 0.02 / (0.11 × 0.0576) ≈ 3.03\n\nThe equilibrium constant (Kc) for the redox reaction between copper (II) ions and iodide ions is approximately 3.03."
