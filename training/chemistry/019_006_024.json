    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction, we need to use the formula:\n\nKc = [C]^c * [D]^d / ([A]^a * [B]^b)\n\nwhere [A], [B], [C], and [D] are the equilibrium concentrations of the respective species, and a, b, c, and d are the stoichiometric coefficients in the balanced chemical equation.\n\nFor the reaction 2A(g) + B(g) ⇌ C(g) + D(g), the stoichiometric coefficients are a = 2, b = 1, c = 1, and d = 1.\n\nGiven the equilibrium concentrations:\n[A] = 0.25 M\n[B] = 0.10 M\n[C] = 0.30 M\n[D] = 0.20 M\n\nPlug these values into the Kc formula:\n\nKc = [0.30]^1 * [0.20]^1 / ([0.25]^2 * [0.10]^1)\n\nKc = (0.30 * 0.20) / (0.0625 * 0.10)\n\nKc = 0.06 / 0.00625\n\nKc ≈ 9.6\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction is approximately 9.6."
