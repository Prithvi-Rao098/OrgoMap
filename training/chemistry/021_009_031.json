    "message_2": "The bond order of a carbon monoxide (CO) molecule can be determined using molecular orbital theory. Molecular orbital theory is a method for describing the electronic structure of molecules using quantum mechanics. It considers the combination of atomic orbitals to form molecular orbitals, which are then filled with electrons according to the Aufbau principle and Hund's rule.\n\nTo determine the bond order of CO, we first need to examine the electronic configuration of carbon (C) and oxygen (O) atoms. Carbon has 6 electrons (1s² 2s² 2p²) and oxygen has 8 electrons (1s² 2s² 2p⁴). When these two atoms combine to form a CO molecule, their atomic orbitals overlap and create molecular orbitals.\n\nThe molecular orbitals formed are as follows:\n\n1. σ(1s) and σ*(1s) - formed by the overlap of 1s orbitals of C and O\n2. σ(2s) and σ*(2s) - formed by the overlap of 2s orbitals of C and O\n3. σ(2p), π(2p), π*(2p), and σ*(2p) - formed by the overlap of 2p orbitals of C and O\n\nNow, we fill these molecular orbitals with the 14 electrons from the C and O atoms, following the Aufbau principle and Hund's rule:\n\n1. σ(1s) - 2 electrons\n2. σ*(1s) - 2 electrons\n3. σ(2s) - 2 electrons\n4. σ*(2s) - 2 electrons\n5. σ(2p) - 2 electrons\n6. π(2p) - 4 electrons (2 in each degenerate orbital)\n\nThe bond order can be calculated using the formula:\n\nBond order = (number of electrons in bonding orbitals - number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\n\nIn the case of CO:\n\nBond order = (2 + 2 + 4) - (2 + 2) / 2 = 8 - 4 / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2\n\nTherefore, the bond order of a carbon monoxide (CO) molecule is 2, which indicates a double bond between the carbon and oxygen atoms."
