    "message_2": "To determine the standard enthalpy change of the reaction between copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO4·5H2O) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to form copper(II) hydroxide (Cu(OH)2) and sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) with coordination complexes, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH° = Σ ΔH°f(products) - Σ ΔH°f(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH° is the standard enthalpy change, and ΔH°f is the standard enthalpy of formation of the compounds.\n\nFirst, we need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nCuSO4·5H2O + 2 NaOH → Cu(OH)2 + Na2SO4 + 5 H2O\n\nNext, we need to find the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔH°f) for each compound involved in the reaction. These values can be found in standard chemistry reference books or online databases. For this example, we will use the following values:\n\nΔH°f(CuSO4·5H2O) = -2274 kJ/mol\nΔH°f(NaOH) = -425.6 kJ/mol\nΔH°f(Cu(OH)2) = -1004 kJ/mol\nΔH°f(Na2SO4) = -1384 kJ/mol\nΔH°f(H2O) = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔH° = [1(-1004) + 1(-1384) + 5(-285.8)] - [1(-2274) + 2(-425.6)]\n\nΔH° = [-1004 - 1384 - 1429] - [-2274 - 851.2]\n\nΔH° = [-3817] - [-3125.2]\n\nΔH° = -691.8 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change of the reaction between copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate and sodium hydroxide to form copper(II) hydroxide and sodium sulfate with coordination complexes is -691.8 kJ/mol."
