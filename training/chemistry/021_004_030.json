    "message_2": "The hybridization of carbon in methane (CH4) is sp3. In methane, the carbon atom forms four sigma bonds with four hydrogen atoms. To accommodate these four bonds, the carbon atom undergoes sp3 hybridization, which involves the mixing of one 2s orbital and three 2p orbitals to form four sp3 hybrid orbitals. These sp3 hybrid orbitals are then used to form sigma bonds with the hydrogen atoms."
