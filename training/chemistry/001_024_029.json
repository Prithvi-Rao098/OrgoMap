Use the given molecular formula and the following data obtained from other spectroscopic techniques: \n\n* molecular formula: C₉H₁₀O\n* proton nuclear magnetic resonance (¹H NMR) spectrum: singlet at δ 2.3 ppm (3H), two doublets at δ 2.6 ppm (2H) and δ 6.9 ppm (1H), and a quartet at δ 7.2 ppm (1H)\n* carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (¹³C NMR) spectrum: signals at δ 20.2 ppm (C(CH₃)₃), δ 24.4 ppm (CH₂), δ 42.9 ppm (C(CH₃)₂), δ 124.3 ppm (CH), and δ 192.1 ppm (C=O)\n\nDetermine the functional group and the structure of the unknown compound, and provide an explanation for the infrared signal observed.",
    "message_2": "The infrared signal at 1720 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O) present in the compound. This functional group is also supported by the ¹³C NMR signal at δ 192.1 ppm.\n\nNow, let's analyze the ¹H NMR and ¹³C NMR data to determine the structure of the compound:\n\n1. The singlet at δ 2.3 ppm (3H) in the ¹H NMR spectrum suggests a methyl group (CH₃) that is not adjacent to any other protons.\n2. The two doublets at δ 2.6 ppm (2H) and δ 6.9 ppm (1H) in the ¹H NMR spectrum indicate two protons on a methylene group (CH₂) and one proton on a carbon atom (CH) that are adjacent to each other.\n3. The quartet at δ 7.2 ppm (1H) in the ¹H NMR spectrum suggests a proton on a carbon atom (CH) that is adjacent to two other protons.\n\nThe ¹³C NMR data provides further information about the carbon atoms in the compound:\n\n1. The signal at δ 20.2 ppm corresponds to a tertiary carbon with three methyl groups attached (C(CH₃)₃).\n2. The signal at δ 24.4 ppm corresponds to a methylene group (CH₂).\n3. The signal at δ 42.9 ppm corresponds to a secondary carbon with two methyl groups attached (C(CH₃)₂).\n4. The signal at δ 124.3 ppm corresponds to a carbon atom with one proton attached (CH).\n\nTaking all the spectroscopic data into account, the structure of the unknown compound can be determined as 2-acetyl-2,3,3-trimethylcyclopentanone. The molecular formula is C₉H₁₀O, and the compound contains a carbonyl group (C=O) as the functional group. The infrared signal at 1720 cm⁻¹ can be attributed to the carbonyl group in the compound."
