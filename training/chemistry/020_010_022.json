    "message_1": "What is the new equilibrium constant of the reaction N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g) when the concentration of NH3 is doubled and the concentration of N2 is tripled with respect to their original equilibrium concentrations? The initial equilibrium constant for the reaction is 0.0625 at 400°C.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the reaction quotient (Q) and compare it to the initial equilibrium constant (K). The reaction quotient is calculated using the same expression as the equilibrium constant, but with the current concentrations of the reactants and products.\n\nLet's denote the initial equilibrium concentrations of N2, H2, and NH3 as [N2]₀, [H2]₀, and [NH3]₀, respectively. The initial equilibrium constant is given as K = 0.0625.\n\nNow, we are given that the concentration of NH3 is doubled and the concentration of N2 is tripled. So, the new concentrations are:\n\n[NH3] = 2[NH3]₀\n[N2] = 3[N2]₀\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1 N2 : 3 H2, when the concentration of N2 is tripled, the concentration of H2 will also be affected. Let's denote the new concentration of H2 as [H2]'.\n\nNow, we can write the expression for the reaction quotient Q:\n\nQ = [NH3]^2 / ([N2] * [H2]^3)\n\nSubstitute the new concentrations:\n\nQ = (2[NH3]₀)^2 / (3[N2]₀ * [H2]'^3)\n\nAt equilibrium, Q = K. Therefore, the new equilibrium constant will still be 0.0625. This is because the equilibrium constant is a function of temperature only, and since the temperature has not changed, the equilibrium constant remains the same.\n\nHowever, the system will shift to re-establish equilibrium. In this case, since Q > K (due to the increase in product concentration), the reaction will shift towards the reactants to re-establish equilibrium."
