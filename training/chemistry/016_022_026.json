    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the isomerization of butene-1 to butene-2, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH = ΔHf(products) - ΔHf(reactants)\n\nIn this case, the reactant is butene-1 and the product is butene-2. The standard enthalpy of formation for butene-1 is -123 kJ/mol and for butene-2 is -131 kJ/mol.\n\nΔH = (-131 kJ/mol) - (-123 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH = -8 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change for the isomerization of butene-1 to butene-2 is -8 kJ/mol."
