    "message_2": "To calculate the bond order and bond length of the nitrogen-oxygen bond in nitric oxide (NO), we first need to determine the molecular orbital configuration of the molecule.\n\nNitric oxide (NO) has an odd number of electrons (7 from nitrogen and 6 from oxygen, for a total of 13). The molecular orbital configuration for NO can be determined using the Aufbau principle and the molecular orbital diagram for diatomic molecules. The molecular orbitals are filled in the following order: σ1s, σ*1s, σ2s, σ*2s, π2px, π2py, σ2pz.\n\nThe electron configuration for NO is:\nσ1s², σ*1s², σ2s², σ*2s², π2px², π2py², σ2pz¹\n\nNow, we can calculate the bond order using the formula:\n\nBond order = (number of electrons in bonding orbitals - number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\n\nBond order = (2 + 2 + 2 + 1 - 2 - 2) / 2\nBond order = (9 - 4) / 2\nBond order = 5 / 2\nBond order = 2.5\n\nThe bond order of the nitrogen-oxygen bond in nitric oxide is 2.5.\n\nTo determine the bond length, we can refer to experimental data or use a general trend. In general, as bond order increases, bond length decreases. The bond length of a nitrogen-nitrogen triple bond (N≡N) is approximately 1.10 Å, while the bond length of a nitrogen-nitrogen double bond (N=N) is approximately 1.25 Å. Since the bond order of the nitrogen-oxygen bond in nitric oxide is 2.5, which is between a double and triple bond, we can estimate that the bond length will be between 1.10 Å and 1.25 Å.\n\nExperimental data shows that the bond length of the nitrogen-oxygen bond in nitric oxide is approximately 1.15 Å.\n\nIn summary, the bond order of the nitrogen-oxygen bond in nitric oxide (NO) is 2.5, and the bond length is approximately 1.15 Å."
