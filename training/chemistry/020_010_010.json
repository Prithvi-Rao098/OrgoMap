    "message_1": "A student has a solution of acetic acid (CH3COOH) with a concentration of 0.1 M and wants to calculate the effect of adding sodium acetate (NaCH3COO) with a concentration of 0.05 M on the equilibrium position of the reaction CH3COOH + H2O ↔ CH3COO- + H3O+. Calculate the new equilibrium concentrations of all species and explain the effect of the added common ion on the equilibrium position.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the new equilibrium concentrations of all species, we can use the concept of the common ion effect and the equilibrium constant (Ka) for acetic acid. The Ka value for acetic acid is 1.8 x 10^-5.\n\nFirst, let's write the equilibrium expression for the reaction:\n\nKa = [CH3COO-][H3O+] / [CH3COOH]\n\nInitially, the concentrations are as follows:\n[CH3COOH] = 0.1 M\n[CH3COO-] = 0.05 M (from the added sodium acetate)\n[H3O+] = 0 (assuming no dissociation has occurred yet)\n\nLet x be the change in concentration of the species as the reaction reaches equilibrium:\n[CH3COOH] = 0.1 - x\n[CH3COO-] = 0.05 + x\n[H3O+] = x\n\nNow, substitute these expressions into the Ka equation:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 = (0.05 + x)(x) / (0.1 - x)\n\nSince Ka is very small, we can assume that x is also very small compared to the initial concentrations. Therefore, we can simplify the equation by assuming that 0.05 + x ≈ 0.05 and 0.1 - x ≈ 0.1:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 = (0.05)(x) / (0.1)\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nx = (1.8 x 10^-5)(0.1) / 0.05\nx = 3.6 x 10^-6\n\nNow we can find the new equilibrium concentrations:\n[CH3COOH] = 0.1 - x ≈ 0.1 - 3.6 x 10^-6 ≈ 0.1 M\n[CH3COO-] = 0.05 + x ≈ 0.05 + 3.6 x 10^-6 ≈ 0.050004 M\n[H3O+] = x ≈ 3.6 x 10^-6 M\n\nThe addition of the common ion (CH3COO-) from sodium acetate causes the equilibrium to shift to the left, according to Le Chatelier's principle. This means that the dissociation of acetic acid (CH3COOH) is suppressed, resulting in a lower concentration of H3O+ ions and a higher concentration of CH3COO- ions at equilibrium. This is the common ion effect, which causes the pH of the solution to increase (become less acidic) due to the decrease in H3O+ concentration."
