    "message_2": "To design a drug that selectively targets the COX-2 enzyme for treating inflammation while avoiding harmful inhibition of the COX-1 enzyme, we need to understand the structural differences between the two enzymes and exploit those differences to create a molecule that binds specifically to COX-2.\n\n1. Study the crystal structures of COX-1 and COX-2: Analyze the available crystal structures of both enzymes to identify the differences in their active sites. This information will help in designing a drug that can selectively bind to the COX-2 enzyme.\n\n2. Identify key amino acid residues: Determine the key amino acid residues in the active sites of COX-1 and COX-2 that are responsible for their substrate binding and catalytic activity. Pay special attention to residues that are unique to COX-2 or have different properties in COX-1.\n\n3. Design a selective inhibitor: Based on the structural differences between COX-1 and COX-2, design a molecule that can selectively bind to the COX-2 active site. This molecule should have functional groups that can form specific interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions) with the unique or different residues in the COX-2 active site, while avoiding interactions with the COX-1 active site.\n\n4. Perform computational docking studies: Use computational methods, such as molecular docking, to predict the binding mode and affinity of the designed inhibitor to both COX-1 and COX-2. This will help to evaluate the selectivity of the inhibitor and guide further optimization.\n\n5. Optimize the inhibitor: Based on the results of the docking studies, modify the inhibitor's structure to improve its selectivity for COX-2. This may involve adding or modifying functional groups to enhance interactions with COX-2 or reduce interactions with COX-1.\n\n6. Synthesize and test the inhibitor: Once an optimized inhibitor has been designed, synthesize the compound and test its activity against both COX-1 and COX-2 in vitro. Confirm its selectivity by comparing its inhibitory potency against both enzymes.\n\n7. Evaluate the inhibitor in cellular and animal models: If the inhibitor shows promising selectivity in vitro, test its anti-inflammatory activity and safety in cellular and animal models of inflammation. This will help to determine its potential as a therapeutic agent for treating inflammation.\n\n8. Further optimization and preclinical studies: If the inhibitor demonstrates efficacy and safety in cellular and animal models, further optimize its pharmacokinetic properties and perform additional preclinical studies to assess its potential for clinical development.\n\nBy following these steps, it is possible to design a drug that selectively targets the COX-2 enzyme for treating inflammation while avoiding harmful inhibition of the COX-1 enzyme."
