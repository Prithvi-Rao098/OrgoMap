    "message_2": "When a reactant is added to a system at equilibrium, the equilibrium position will shift to counteract the change and re-establish equilibrium. This is described by Le Chatelier's principle, which states that if a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in concentration, temperature, or pressure, the system will adjust its equilibrium position to counteract the change.\n\nLet's consider the following balanced chemical equation as an example:\n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) â‡Œ 2NH3(g)\n\nIn this reaction, nitrogen gas (N2) reacts with hydrogen gas (H2) to form ammonia gas (NH3). Suppose the system is at equilibrium, and we add more N2 to the reaction mixture. According to Le Chatelier's principle, the equilibrium will shift to the right to consume the added N2 and re-establish equilibrium. This will result in the formation of more NH3.\n\nNow let's discuss how the reaction quotient (Q) and the equilibrium constant (K) will change. The reaction quotient, Q, is calculated using the same expression as the equilibrium constant, K, but with the current concentrations of the reactants and products:\n\nQ = [NH3]^2 / ([N2] * [H2]^3)\n\nWhen we add more N2, the concentration of N2 increases, which causes Q to decrease. Since the system is initially at equilibrium, Q = K. However, when Q becomes smaller than K due to the addition of N2, the reaction will shift to the right (toward the products) to re-establish equilibrium, and Q will increase until it equals K again.\n\nIt is important to note that the equilibrium constant, K, remains unchanged as long as the temperature of the system is constant. K is only affected by changes in temperature, not by changes in concentrations of reactants or products. So, in this case, K will not change, but the reaction will adjust its position to maintain the relationship Q = K."
