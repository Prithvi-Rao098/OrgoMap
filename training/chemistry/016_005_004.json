    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of combustion of methane gas (CH4), we need to first determine the number of moles of methane in 1.0 g and then use the heat released to find the enthalpy change per mole.\n\nThe molar mass of methane (CH4) is:\nC: 12.01 g/mol\nH: 1.01 g/mol\n\nMolar mass of CH4 = 12.01 + (4 Ã— 1.01) = 12.01 + 4.04 = 16.05 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the number of moles in 1.0 g of methane:\nmoles = mass / molar mass\nmoles = 1.0 g / 16.05 g/mol = 0.0623 mol\n\nThe heat released (-890 kJ) is for 1.0 g of methane, which is 0.0623 mol. To find the enthalpy of combustion per mole, we can use the following equation:\n\nenthalpy of combustion = heat released / moles\nenthalpy of combustion = -890 kJ / 0.0623 mol = -14288.6 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy of combustion of methane gas (CH4) is approximately -14,289 kJ/mol."
