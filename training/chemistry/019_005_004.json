The balanced chemical equation is:\n\nC3H8(g) + 5O2(g) → 3CO2(g) + 4H2O(g)\n\nGiven standard Gibbs free energy of formation (ΔGf°) values in kJ/mol: \nC3H8(g): -103.8\nCO2(g): -394.4\nH2O(g): -241.8\nO2(g): 0.0\n\nNote: The student may need to use the equation ΔG = ΔG° + RTlnQ, where ΔG° is the standard Gibbs free energy change, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and Q is the reaction quotient.",
    "message_2": "To find the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the combustion of propane at 25°C and 1 atm pressure, we can use the equation:\n\nΔG = ΔG° + RTlnQ\n\nHowever, since the reaction is under standard conditions (25°C and 1 atm pressure), the reaction quotient (Q) is equal to 1, and therefore lnQ is equal to 0. This simplifies the equation to:\n\nΔG = ΔG°\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) using the given standard Gibbs free energy of formation (ΔGf°) values and the balanced chemical equation:\n\nΔG° = [3(ΔGf° CO2) + 4(ΔGf° H2O)] - [1(ΔGf° C3H8) + 5(ΔGf° O2)]\n\nGiven values:\nΔGf° C3H8 = -103.8 kJ/mol\nΔGf° CO2 = -394.4 kJ/mol\nΔGf° H2O = -241.8 kJ/mol\nΔGf° O2 = 0.0 kJ/mol\n\nSubstitute the given values into the equation:\n\nΔG° = [3(-394.4) + 4(-241.8)] - [1(-103.8) + 5(0.0)]\nΔG° = [-1183.2 - 967.2] - [-103.8]\nΔG° = -2150.4 + 103.8\nΔG° = -2046.6 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the combustion of propane at 25°C and 1 atm pressure is -2046.6 kJ/mol."
