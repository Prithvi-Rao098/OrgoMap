    "message_2": "The electrophilic addition reaction between sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and propene (C3H6) involves the following steps:\n\n1. Protonation of the alkene: In the first step, the alkene (propene) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic hydrogen atom of sulfuric acid. This results in the formation of a carbocation intermediate and a bisulfate ion (HSO4-).\n\nC3H6 + H2SO4 -> [C3H7+] + [HSO4-]\n\n2. Nucleophilic attack by the bisulfate ion: The carbocation intermediate formed in the previous step is now attacked by the nucleophilic bisulfate ion (HSO4-). The bisulfate ion donates a pair of electrons to form a bond with the carbocation, resulting in the formation of the final product.\n\n[C3H7+] + [HSO4-] -> C3H7OSO3H\n\nThe product formed in this reaction is 2-hydroxypropyl hydrogen sulfate (C3H7OSO3H), which is an alkyl hydrogen sulfate. This reaction is an example of electrophilic addition of sulfuric acid to an alkene, where the alkene acts as a nucleophile and the sulfuric acid acts as an electrophile."
