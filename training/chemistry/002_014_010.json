    "message_2": "To calculate the formal charge on the central atom (sulfur) in SO3²⁻, we will use the formula:\n\nFormal charge = (Valence electrons of the atom) - (Non-bonding electrons) - (1/2 × Bonding electrons)\n\nSulfur (S) has 6 valence electrons being in group 16 of the periodic table. In the SO3²⁻ ion, sulfur is double bonded to three oxygen atoms. Each double bond consists of 2 bonding electrons, so there are a total of 6 bonding electrons around sulfur. Sulfur has no non-bonding electrons in this case.\n\nNow, let's plug the values into the formula:\n\nFormal charge on S = (6) - (0) - (1/2 × 6)\nFormal charge on S = 6 - 3 = +3\n\nSo, the formal charge on the central sulfur atom is +3.\n\nNow, let's determine the overall charge of the SO3²⁻ ion. Each oxygen atom has a formal charge of -1 due to the double bond with sulfur. Since there are three oxygen atoms, the total charge from the oxygen atoms is -3. Adding the formal charge of sulfur (+3) to the total charge of the oxygen atoms (-3), we get:\n\nOverall charge = (+3) + (-3) = 0\n\nHowever, the ion is SO3²⁻, which means it has an overall charge of -2. This discrepancy arises because the Lewis structure of SO3²⁻ is a resonance hybrid, and the formal charges calculated are for a single resonance structure. The actual ion has a delocalized charge, and the overall charge is -2, as indicated by the superscript in SO3²⁻."
