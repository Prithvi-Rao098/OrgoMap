    "message_1": "What would be the limiting reagent when preparing 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine from hydrazine and 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene and what would be the theoretical yield of the product if 10 grams of hydrazine and 15 grams of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene are used in the reaction?",
    "message_2": "To determine the limiting reagent and the theoretical yield, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nN2H4 + C6H3Cl(NO2)2 → C6H3N2H(NO2)2 + HCl\n\nNext, we need to calculate the moles of each reactant:\n\nMolar mass of hydrazine (N2H4) = (2 × 14.01) + (4 × 1.01) = 32.05 g/mol\nMoles of hydrazine = 10 g / 32.05 g/mol = 0.312 moles\n\nMolar mass of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (C6H3Cl(NO2)2) = (6 × 12.01) + (3 × 1.01) + 35.45 + (4 × 14.01) + (4 × 16.00) = 202.56 g/mol\nMoles of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene = 15 g / 202.56 g/mol = 0.0741 moles\n\nNow, we need to determine the mole ratio of the reactants:\n\nMole ratio = moles of hydrazine / moles of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene = 0.312 / 0.0741 = 4.21\n\nSince the balanced equation shows a 1:1 ratio between the reactants, the reactant with the lowest mole ratio is the limiting reagent. In this case, 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene is the limiting reagent.\n\nTo calculate the theoretical yield, we use the moles of the limiting reagent and the stoichiometry of the reaction:\n\nMoles of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (C6H3N2H(NO2)2) = 0.0741 moles (1:1 ratio)\n\nMolar mass of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine = (6 × 12.01) + (3 × 1.01) + (2 × 14.01) + (4 × 16.00) = 198.14 g/mol\n\nTheoretical yield = moles of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine × molar mass = 0.0741 moles × 198.14 g/mol = 14.68 g\n\nSo, the limiting reagent is 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene, and the theoretical yield of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine is 14.68 grams."
