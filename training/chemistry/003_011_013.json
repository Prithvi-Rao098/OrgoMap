    "message_2": "Aluminum oxide (Al2O3), also known as alumina, has a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure called corundum. In this structure, aluminum ions are surrounded by six oxygen ions in an octahedral arrangement, while each oxygen ion is surrounded by four aluminum ions in a tetrahedral arrangement. This results in a highly stable and dense crystal lattice."
