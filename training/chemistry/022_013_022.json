    "message_2": "The oxidation state of iron in Fe2O3 is +3. \n\nHere's the explanation: In Fe2O3, there are two iron (Fe) atoms and three oxygen (O) atoms. Oxygen has an oxidation state of -2. Since there are three oxygen atoms, the total oxidation state for oxygen in the compound is -6. \n\nFor the compound to be neutral, the total oxidation state of the two iron atoms must be +6. Therefore, each iron atom has an oxidation state of +3."
