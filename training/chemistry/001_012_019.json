    "message_2": "The major difference between primary, secondary, and tertiary amines lies in the number of carbon atoms directly bonded to the nitrogen atom. In primary amines, the nitrogen atom is bonded to one carbon atom and two hydrogen atoms. In secondary amines, the nitrogen atom is bonded to two carbon atoms and one hydrogen atom. In tertiary amines, the nitrogen atom is bonded to three carbon atoms and no hydrogen atoms.\n\nPrimary amine: R-NH2\nSecondary amine: R-NH-R'\nTertiary amine: R-N-R'-R''\n\nNow, let's discuss the reaction mechanism of a primary amine with a carboxylic acid to form an amide. The reaction is an example of nucleophilic acyl substitution. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the mechanism:\n\n1. Nucleophilic attack: The nitrogen atom in the primary amine (R-NH2) acts as a nucleophile due to its lone pair of electrons. It attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon atom in the carboxylic acid (R'-COOH), forming a tetrahedral intermediate.\n\n2. Proton transfer: A proton (H+) is transferred from the nitrogen atom in the tetrahedral intermediate to the oxygen atom of the hydroxyl group (OH) in the carboxylic acid. This results in the formation of a hydroxyl group (OH) on the nitrogen atom and a negatively charged oxygen atom (O-) in the tetrahedral intermediate.\n\n3. Elimination of water: The negatively charged oxygen atom in the tetrahedral intermediate extracts a proton (H+) from the nitrogen atom, forming a double bond between the nitrogen and the carbonyl carbon atom. Simultaneously, the hydroxyl group (OH) leaves as a water molecule (H2O), resulting in the formation of an amide (R-NH-C(O)-R').\n\nOverall, the reaction can be summarized as follows:\n\nR-NH2 + R'-COOH â†’ R-NH-C(O)-R' + H2O\n\nIn this reaction, a primary amine (R-NH2) reacts with a carboxylic acid (R'-COOH) to form an amide (R-NH-C(O)-R') and water (H2O)."
