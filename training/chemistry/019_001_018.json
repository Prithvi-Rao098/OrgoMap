    "message_1": "Sure. Here's a specific problem for a chemistry student to solve:\n\nCalculate the standard enthalpy change (∆H°) for the following reaction using the given bond dissociation energies: \n2CH4(g) + 3O2(g) → 2CO2(g) + 4H2O(g) \n\nGiven Bond Dissociation Energies:\nC-H = 413 kJ/mol \nO=O = 495 kJ/mol \nC=O = 799 kJ/mol \nO-H = 463 kJ/mol",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change (∆H°) for the given reaction, we need to find the difference between the energy required to break the bonds in the reactants and the energy released when the bonds in the products are formed.\n\nFirst, let's determine the energy required to break the bonds in the reactants:\n\n2CH4(g): There are 4 C-H bonds in each CH4 molecule, and there are 2 CH4 molecules, so we have a total of 8 C-H bonds to break.\nEnergy required = 8 bonds × 413 kJ/mol (C-H bond energy) = 3304 kJ/mol\n\n3O2(g): There are 3 O=O bonds to break.\nEnergy required = 3 bonds × 495 kJ/mol (O=O bond energy) = 1485 kJ/mol\n\nTotal energy required to break the bonds in the reactants = 3304 kJ/mol + 1485 kJ/mol = 4789 kJ/mol\n\nNow, let's determine the energy released when the bonds in the products are formed:\n\n2CO2(g): There are 2 C=O bonds in each CO2 molecule, and there are 2 CO2 molecules, so we have a total of 4 C=O bonds formed.\nEnergy released = 4 bonds × 799 kJ/mol (C=O bond energy) = 3196 kJ/mol\n\n4H2O(g): There are 2 O-H bonds in each H2O molecule, and there are 4 H2O molecules, so we have a total of 8 O-H bonds formed.\nEnergy released = 8 bonds × 463 kJ/mol (O-H bond energy) = 3704 kJ/mol\n\nTotal energy released when the bonds in the products are formed = 3196 kJ/mol + 3704 kJ/mol = 6900 kJ/mol\n\nFinally, we can calculate the standard enthalpy change (∆H°) for the reaction:\n\n∆H° = Energy released - Energy required = 6900 kJ/mol - 4789 kJ/mol = 2111 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change for the given reaction is ∆H° = 2111 kJ/mol."
