    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of vaporization of water at 100°C, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates the vapor pressure of a substance to its temperature and enthalpy of vaporization:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nHere, P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively, ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization, and R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol*K).\n\nWe are given that the vapor pressure of water at 100°C (373.15 K) is 1 atm. We also know that the vapor pressure of water at its normal boiling point (373.15 K) is 1 atm. Therefore, we can use the normal boiling point of water as our reference point:\n\nP1 = 1 atm (101.325 kPa)\nT1 = 373.15 K (100°C)\n\nP2 = 1 atm (101.325 kPa)\nT2 = 373.15 K (100°C)\n\nSince P1 = P2 and T1 = T2, the Clausius-Clapeyron equation simplifies to:\n\nln(1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/373.15 - 1/373.15)\n\n0 = -ΔHvap/R * 0\n\nAs we can see, the equation does not provide any information about the enthalpy of vaporization in this case. However, we can use the known value of the enthalpy of vaporization of water at its normal boiling point:\n\nΔHvap = 40.7 kJ/mol\n\nThis value is a good approximation for the enthalpy of vaporization of water at 100°C, as the temperature difference is small."
