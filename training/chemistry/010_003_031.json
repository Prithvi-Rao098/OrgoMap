    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the electrochemical reaction between a copper electrode in a 1 M copper(II) sulfate solution and a standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) in a 1 M hydrogen ion solution at 25°C, we need to use the following equation:\n\nΔG = -nFE\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the reaction, F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol), and E is the cell potential.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the cell potential (E) for the reaction. The cell potential can be calculated using the Nernst equation:\n\nE = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\n\nwhere E° is the standard cell potential, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin (25°C = 298 K), and Q is the reaction quotient.\n\nFor the given reaction, the half-reactions are:\n\n1. Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu (reduction)\n2. 2H⁺ + 2e⁻ → H₂ (oxidation)\n\nThe standard reduction potential (E°) for Cu²⁺/Cu is +0.34 V, and for the SHE (H⁺/H₂), it is 0 V by definition. Since the copper electrode is being reduced and the hydrogen electrode is being oxidized, the overall cell potential (E°) is:\n\nE° = E°(Cu²⁺/Cu) - E°(H⁺/H₂) = 0.34 V - 0 V = 0.34 V\n\nSince both the copper(II) sulfate and hydrogen ion solutions have a concentration of 1 M, the reaction quotient (Q) is:\n\nQ = [Cu²⁺][H₂]/[H⁺]² = (1)(1)/(1)² = 1\n\nNow we can calculate the cell potential (E) using the Nernst equation:\n\nE = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(Q) = 0.34 V - (8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K / (2 * 96,485 C/mol)) * ln(1)\n\nSince ln(1) = 0, the cell potential (E) remains 0.34 V.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) using the equation:\n\nΔG = -nFE = -(2 mol)(96,485 C/mol)(0.34 V) = -65,609.4 J/mol\n\nSo, the Gibbs free energy change for the electrochemical reaction is -65,609.4 J/mol."
