    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat needed to melt the ice, we can use the formula:\n\nq = n * ΔHf\n\nwhere q is the heat required, n is the number of moles of the substance, and ΔHf is the enthalpy of fusion.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles (n) of ice. The molar mass of water (H2O) is approximately 18.015 g/mol. \n\nn = mass / molar mass\nn = 25 g / 18.015 g/mol\nn ≈ 1.387 moles\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat required (q) using the enthalpy of fusion (ΔHf):\n\nq = n * ΔHf\nq = 1.387 moles * 6.02 kJ/mol\nq ≈ 8.35 kJ\n\nTherefore, the amount of heat needed to melt 25 grams of ice at its melting point is approximately 8.35 kJ."
