    "message_2": "Primary, secondary, and tertiary amines are organic compounds containing nitrogen atoms with different numbers of carbon atoms directly bonded to the nitrogen atom. The classification is based on the number of alkyl or aryl groups attached to the nitrogen atom:\n\n1. Primary amines (1° amines) have one alkyl or aryl group attached to the nitrogen atom, with the general formula RNH2. An example is methylamine (CH3NH2).\n\n2. Secondary amines (2° amines) have two alkyl or aryl groups attached to the nitrogen atom, with the general formula R2NH. An example is dimethylamine (CH3)2NH.\n\n3. Tertiary amines (3° amines) have three alkyl or aryl groups attached to the nitrogen atom, with the general formula R3N. An example is trimethylamine (CH3)3N.\n\nIn terms of basicity, amines act as Lewis bases due to the presence of a lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom. The basicity of amines is influenced by the electron-donating or electron-withdrawing nature of the substituents attached to the nitrogen atom. Generally, primary amines are more basic than secondary amines, and secondary amines are more basic than tertiary amines. This trend is due to the inductive effect and steric hindrance. Alkyl groups are electron-donating, which increases the electron density on the nitrogen atom, making it more available to donate its lone pair to an acid. However, steric hindrance caused by bulky alkyl groups in secondary and tertiary amines can reduce their basicity.\n\nA common amine used in everyday products is ethylenediamine (H2NCH2CH2NH2), which is a primary amine. It is used as a chelating agent in various applications, such as water treatment, detergents, and personal care products. In these applications, ethylenediamine forms complexes with metal ions, which helps to soften water, remove metal ions from surfaces, and stabilize formulations."
