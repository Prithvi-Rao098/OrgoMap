    "message_1": "What is the specific surface area of a sample of activated carbon if it adsorbs 0.3 moles of nitrogen gas at 77 K and at a pressure of 1 atm? The cross-sectional area of nitrogen is 0.162 nm² and the density of nitrogen at its boiling point is 0.807 g/L. The mass of the activated carbon sample used for the adsorption was 4 g.",
    "message_2": "To determine the specific surface area of the activated carbon sample, we can use the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory. The BET theory is based on the idea that gas molecules adsorb onto a solid surface in layers. In this case, we will assume that nitrogen gas adsorbs onto the activated carbon in a monolayer.\n\nFirst, let's find the total surface area of the adsorbed nitrogen gas. We know that 0.3 moles of nitrogen gas are adsorbed, and the cross-sectional area of a nitrogen molecule is 0.162 nm². \n\nTotal surface area of adsorbed nitrogen = moles of nitrogen * Avogadro's number * cross-sectional area of nitrogen\nTotal surface area of adsorbed nitrogen = 0.3 moles * 6.022 x 10^23 molecules/mole * 0.162 nm²/molecule\n\nTotal surface area of adsorbed nitrogen ≈ 2.93 x 10^22 nm²\n\nNow, we need to find the specific surface area of the activated carbon sample. The specific surface area is the total surface area per unit mass of the sample. We know that the mass of the activated carbon sample is 4 g.\n\nSpecific surface area = Total surface area of adsorbed nitrogen / mass of activated carbon\nSpecific surface area = 2.93 x 10^22 nm² / 4 g\n\nSpecific surface area ≈ 7.33 x 10^21 nm²/g\n\nTherefore, the specific surface area of the activated carbon sample is approximately 7.33 x 10^21 nm²/g."
