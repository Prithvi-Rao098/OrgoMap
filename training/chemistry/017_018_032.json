    "message_2": "The photochemical properties of cis-[Co(en)2Cl2]+ (where en = ethylenediamine) involve the absorption of light energy, which can induce changes in the electronic configuration of the complex. This can lead to the formation of new products through a process called photoisomerization.\n\nThe photochemical reaction mechanism for cis-[Co(en)2Cl2]+ is as follows:\n\n1. Absorption of light: When the cis-[Co(en)2Cl2]+ complex absorbs light, it undergoes a transition from its ground state to an excited state. This is due to the promotion of an electron from a lower-energy d-orbital to a higher-energy d-orbital.\n\n2. Isomerization: In the excited state, the complex can undergo isomerization, which involves the rearrangement of its ligands. In this case, the cis-[Co(en)2Cl2]+ complex can isomerize to its trans isomer, trans-[Co(en)2Cl2]+. This process is known as photoisomerization.\n\n3. Relaxation: After the isomerization, the complex returns to its ground state by releasing the absorbed energy in the form of heat or light (fluorescence or phosphorescence). This results in the formation of the trans isomer as the final product.\n\nThe main product formed in this photochemical reaction is the trans isomer, trans-[Co(en)2Cl2]+. This isomerization can have significant effects on the chemical and physical properties of the complex, such as changes in its reactivity, color, and magnetic properties. The photoisomerization of cis-[Co(en)2Cl2]+ to trans-[Co(en)2Cl2]+ is an example of how light energy can be used to control the structure and properties of coordination complexes."
