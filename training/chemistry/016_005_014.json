Calculate the enthalpy of combustion in both kJ/mol and kJ/g.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of combustion of methane, we need to use the following equation:\n\nΔH_combustion = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH_combustion is the enthalpy of combustion, ΔH_f(products) is the sum of the heats of formation of the products, and ΔH_f(reactants) is the sum of the heats of formation of the reactants.\n\nThe balanced equation for the combustion of methane is:\n\nCH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(g)\n\nThe heat of formation of methane (CH4) is given as -74.9 kJ/mol. We also need the heats of formation for carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). The standard heat of formation for CO2(g) is -393.5 kJ/mol, and for H2O(g) is -241.8 kJ/mol.\n\nNow we can calculate the enthalpy of combustion:\n\nΔH_combustion = [1 × (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 × (-241.8 kJ/mol)] - [1 × (-74.9 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH_combustion = (-393.5 - 2 × 241.8 + 74.9) kJ/mol\n\nΔH_combustion = (-393.5 - 483.6 + 74.9) kJ/mol\n\nΔH_combustion = -802.2 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we need to convert the enthalpy of combustion to kJ/g. The molar mass of methane (CH4) is 12.01 g/mol (C) + 4 × 1.01 g/mol (H) = 16.04 g/mol.\n\nEnthalpy of combustion in kJ/g:\n\nΔH_combustion = -802.2 kJ/mol ÷ 16.04 g/mol\n\nΔH_combustion = -50.0 kJ/g\n\nSo, the enthalpy of combustion of methane gas at standard conditions is -802.2 kJ/mol and -50.0 kJ/g."
