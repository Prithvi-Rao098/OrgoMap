    "message_2": "To calculate the standard free energy change (ΔG°) for the given redox reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG° = -nFE°cell\n\nwhere:\nΔG° = standard free energy change\nn = number of moles of electrons transferred in the redox reaction\nF = Faraday's constant (96,485 C/mol)\nE°cell = standard cell potential\n\nFirst, we need to determine the number of moles of electrons transferred in the redox reaction. In this case, the balanced redox reaction is:\n\nZn(s) + 2 Ag+(aq) → Zn2+(aq) + 2 Ag(s)\n\nThe zinc atom loses 2 electrons (oxidation) and each silver ion gains 1 electron (reduction). Since there are 2 silver ions involved, a total of 2 moles of electrons are transferred.\n\nNow we can plug the values into the equation:\n\nΔG° = - (2 mol) (96,485 C/mol) (0.91 V)\n\nΔG° = - (2) (96,485) (0.91)\n\nΔG° = -175,763.7 J/mol\n\nSince the standard free energy change is usually expressed in kJ/mol, we can convert the value:\n\nΔG° = -175.76 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard free energy change (ΔG°) for the given redox reaction at 298 K is -175.76 kJ/mol."
