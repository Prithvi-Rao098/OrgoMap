    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the sublimation of solid iodine at 25°C, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates the enthalpy change of a phase transition to the temperature and entropy change of the process. The equation is as follows:\n\nΔH = T * ΔS\n\nwhere ΔH is the standard enthalpy change, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ΔS is the molar entropy change of the process.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given temperature from Celsius to Kelvin:\n\nT = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\n\nNext, we are given the molar entropy of sublimation (ΔS) as 62.43 J/mol·K. Now we can plug these values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nΔH = (298.15 K) * (62.43 J/mol·K) = 18605.4 J/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the sublimation of solid iodine at 25°C is approximately 18,605.4 J/mol."
