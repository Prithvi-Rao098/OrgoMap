    "message_1": "Calculate the standard enthalpy change for the sublimation of iodine (I2) if 1 mole of I2(s) is converted to 1 mole of I2(g) at 25°C and 1 bar pressure. Given the following information:\n- The standard enthalpy of fusion of I2 is 15.4 kJ/mol\n- The standard enthalpy of vaporization of I2 is 41.3 kJ/mol\n- The standard entropy change for the sublimation of I2 is 62.4 J/mol K.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the sublimation of iodine, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH_sublimation = ΔH_fusion + ΔH_vaporization\n\nGiven the standard enthalpy of fusion (ΔH_fusion) is 15.4 kJ/mol and the standard enthalpy of vaporization (ΔH_vaporization) is 41.3 kJ/mol, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔH_sublimation = 15.4 kJ/mol + 41.3 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_sublimation = 56.7 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the sublimation of iodine (I2) is 56.7 kJ/mol."
