    "message_2": "To find the enthalpy change for the reaction of 2 moles of HCl with 1 mole of CaCO3, we can use the given enthalpy change for the reaction of 1 mole of HCl with CaCO3 and multiply it by the number of moles of HCl involved in the reaction.\n\nGiven enthalpy change for 1 mole of HCl reacting with CaCO3: -975 kJ/mol\n\nSince there are 2 moles of HCl reacting with 1 mole of CaCO3, we can multiply the given enthalpy change by 2:\n\nEnthalpy change for 2 moles of HCl reacting with 1 mole of CaCO3 = 2 * (-975 kJ/mol) = -1950 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy change for the reaction of 2 moles of hydrochloric acid with 1 mole of calcium carbonate is -1950 kJ/mol."
