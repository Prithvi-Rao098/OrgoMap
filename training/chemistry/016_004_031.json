    "message_1": "Sure, Here's a precise problem for the student to solve:\n\nA student conducts an experiment to determine the heat capacity of an unknown metal. The metal is placed in a calorimeter containing 200 mL of water at an initial temperature of 25°C. The initial temperature of the metal is 150°C. The final temperature of the metal and water mixture is 30°C. The mass of the metal is 25 g. Calculate the heat capacity of the unknown metal.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the heat capacity of the unknown metal, we can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat transferred, m is the mass, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nFirst, we need to find the heat gained by the water and the heat lost by the metal. Since the heat gained by the water is equal to the heat lost by the metal, we can set up the following equation:\n\nq_water = q_metal\n\nFor water, we have:\nmass_water = 200 g (assuming 1 mL of water has a mass of 1 g)\nspecific_heat_water = 4.18 J/g°C\nΔT_water = 30°C - 25°C = 5°C\n\nFor the metal, we have:\nmass_metal = 25 g\nΔT_metal = 150°C - 30°C = 120°C\n\nNow, we can set up the equation:\n\nmass_water * specific_heat_water * ΔT_water = mass_metal * specific_heat_metal * ΔT_metal\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n200 g * 4.18 J/g°C * 5°C = 25 g * specific_heat_metal * 120°C\n\nSolving for specific_heat_metal:\n\n4180 J = 25 g * specific_heat_metal * 120°C\n\nspecific_heat_metal = 4180 J / (25 g * 120°C)\n\nspecific_heat_metal ≈ 1.39 J/g°C\n\nSo, the heat capacity of the unknown metal is approximately 1.39 J/g°C."
