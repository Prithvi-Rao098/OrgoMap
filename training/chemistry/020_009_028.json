    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a chemistry problem for you:\n\nWhat is the equilibrium constant, Kc, for the reaction between nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas to form ammonia gas, according to the following chemical equation?\n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) â‡Œ 2NH3(g)\n\nGiven the following data at a certain temperature:\n\n[NO2] = 0.225 M\n[N2O4] = 0.045 M\n\nThanks!",
    "message_2": "The given data ([NO2] and [N2O4]) is not related to the reaction between nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas to form ammonia gas. To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction, we need the equilibrium concentrations of N2, H2, and NH3.\n\nIf you can provide the equilibrium concentrations of N2, H2, and NH3, I can help you calculate the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction."
