    "message_2": "The electrophilic addition of hydrogen bromide (HBr) to propene is a two-step process involving the formation of a carbocation intermediate. Here's the mechanism:\n\nStep 1: Protonation of the alkene\nThe alkene (propene) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic hydrogen atom of HBr. This leads to the formation of a carbocation intermediate and a bromide ion (Br-). The carbocation can be formed at either the primary or secondary carbon atom, but the more stable carbocation is formed at the secondary carbon due to hyperconjugation.\n\nPropene + HBr → [CH3-CH(+)-CH3] + Br-\n\nStep 2: Nucleophilic attack by bromide ion\nThe bromide ion (Br-) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbocation, forming a new C-Br bond. This results in the formation of 2-bromopropane.\n\n[CH3-CH(+)-CH3] + Br- → CH3-CHBr-CH3\n\nThe overall reaction is:\nPropene + HBr → 2-bromopropane\n\nThe electrophilic addition of hydrogen chloride (HCl) to propene follows a similar mechanism:\n\nStep 1: Protonation of the alkene\nPropene + HCl → [CH3-CH(+)-CH3] + Cl-\n\nStep 2: Nucleophilic attack by chloride ion\n[CH3-CH(+)-CH3] + Cl- → CH3-CHCl-CH3\n\nThe overall reaction is:\nPropene + HCl → 2-chloropropane\n\nThe main difference between the addition of HBr and HCl to propene is the identity of the halogen atom (bromine vs. chlorine) and the corresponding halide ions (Br- vs. Cl-). Both reactions follow the same mechanism and result in the formation of haloalkanes (2-bromopropane and 2-chloropropane, respectively). However, the reactivity of HBr and HCl may differ due to the difference in bond strength and electronegativity between hydrogen and the halogen atoms. HBr is generally more reactive than HCl in electrophilic addition reactions due to the weaker H-Br bond compared to the H-Cl bond."
