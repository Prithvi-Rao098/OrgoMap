(The density of the solution is assumed to be 1 g/mL and the specific heat capacity of the solution is assumed to be 4.18 J/g°C.)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the heat of neutralization, we can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat of neutralization, m is the mass of the solution, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the temperature change.\n\nFirst, we need to find the mass of the solution. Since the density is 1 g/mL, the mass of the solution is equal to the volume of the solution. The total volume of the solution is 50 mL of HCl + 50 mL of NaOH = 100 mL. Therefore, the mass of the solution is 100 g.\n\nNext, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nq = (100 g)(4.18 J/g°C)(10°C)\n\nq = 4180 J\n\nThe heat of neutralization of hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide when 50 mL of 1 M HCl is mixed with 50 mL of 1 M NaOH, and the temperature change is recorded as 10°C is 4180 J."
