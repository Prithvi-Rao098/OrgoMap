    "message_2": "The effect of surface area on the rate of reaction between marble chips (calcium carbonate) and hydrochloric acid can be explained through the collision theory. According to the collision theory, the rate of a chemical reaction depends on the frequency of collisions between the reacting particles and the energy with which they collide.\n\nIn the reaction between marble chips (CaCO3) and hydrochloric acid (HCl), the following reaction occurs:\n\nCaCO3 (s) + 2HCl (aq) â†’ CaCl2 (aq) + H2O (l) + CO2 (g)\n\nWhen the surface area of the marble chips is increased, there are more exposed particles available for collisions with the hydrochloric acid molecules. This leads to an increased frequency of collisions between the reactants, which in turn increases the rate of reaction.\n\nFor example, if you were to use powdered marble instead of marble chips, the reaction would occur at a much faster rate because the powdered marble has a larger surface area compared to the marble chips. This allows for more collisions between the calcium carbonate and hydrochloric acid particles, leading to a faster rate of reaction.\n\nIn summary, increasing the surface area of the marble chips in contact with hydrochloric acid will increase the rate of reaction between the two substances due to an increased frequency of collisions between the reacting particles."
