    "message_1": "How much nitrobenzene, in grams, is needed to produce 50 grams of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene during the reaction with excess chlorine gas? Assume a 90% yield of the desired product and that the other products are negligible.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concepts of stoichiometry and percent yield. First, let's write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nC6H5NO2 (nitrobenzene) + 2 Cl2 (chlorine gas) → C6H3Cl2NO2 (2,4-dichloronitrobenzene)\n\nNow, we need to find the molar mass of nitrobenzene and 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene:\n\nNitrobenzene (C6H5NO2): (6 × 12.01) + (5 × 1.01) + (1 × 14.01) + (2 × 16.00) = 123.11 g/mol\n2,4-Dichloronitrobenzene (C6H3Cl2NO2): (6 × 12.01) + (3 × 1.01) + (2 × 35.45) + (1 × 14.01) + (2 × 16.00) = 197.02 g/mol\n\nWe are given that 50 grams of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene are produced with a 90% yield. To find the theoretical yield, we can use the following equation:\n\nActual yield = Theoretical yield × Percent yield\n50 g = Theoretical yield × 0.90\n\nTheoretical yield = 50 g / 0.90 = 55.56 g (of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene)\n\nNow, we can use stoichiometry to find the amount of nitrobenzene needed:\n\n1 mol C6H5NO2 / 1 mol C6H3Cl2NO2 = x g C6H5NO2 / 55.56 g C6H3Cl2NO2\n\nWe can rearrange the equation to solve for x:\n\nx = (1 mol C6H5NO2 / 1 mol C6H3Cl2NO2) × 55.56 g C6H3Cl2NO2\n\nNow, we need to convert the moles of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene to moles of nitrobenzene using the molar masses:\n\nx = (123.11 g/mol C6H5NO2 / 197.02 g/mol C6H3Cl2NO2) × 55.56 g C6H3Cl2NO2\n\nx ≈ 34.61 g\n\nSo, approximately 34.61 grams of nitrobenzene are needed to produce 50 grams of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene with a 90% yield."
