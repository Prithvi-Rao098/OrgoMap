    "message_2": "To calculate the formal charge of each atom in the CH3COOH molecule, we can use the formula:\n\nFormal charge = (Valence electrons) - (Non-bonding electrons) - (1/2 × Bonding electrons)\n\nThe CH3COOH molecule can be represented as CH3-COOH. Let's break it down into individual atoms and calculate their formal charges:\n\n1. Carbon (C1) in CH3:\nValence electrons: 4 (for carbon)\nNon-bonding electrons: 0 (all electrons are involved in bonding)\nBonding electrons: 8 (4 single bonds with 3 hydrogens and 1 carbon)\nFormal charge = 4 - 0 - (1/2 × 8) = 4 - 4 = 0\n\n2. Hydrogen (H) in CH3:\nValence electrons: 1 (for hydrogen)\nNon-bonding electrons: 0 (all electrons are involved in bonding)\nBonding electrons: 2 (1 single bond with carbon)\nFormal charge = 1 - 0 - (1/2 × 2) = 1 - 1 = 0\n\n3. Carbon (C2) in COOH:\nValence electrons: 4 (for carbon)\nNon-bonding electrons: 0 (all electrons are involved in bonding)\nBonding electrons: 8 (1 single bond with C1, 1 single bond with O, and 1 double bond with O)\nFormal charge = 4 - 0 - (1/2 × 8) = 4 - 4 = 0\n\n4. Oxygen (O1) in COOH with single bond:\nValence electrons: 6 (for oxygen)\nNon-bonding electrons: 4 (2 lone pairs)\nBonding electrons: 2 (1 single bond with C2)\nFormal charge = 6 - 4 - (1/2 × 2) = 6 - 4 - 1 = 1\n\n5. Oxygen (O2) in COOH with double bond:\nValence electrons: 6 (for oxygen)\nNon-bonding electrons: 4 (2 lone pairs)\nBonding electrons: 4 (1 double bond with C2)\nFormal charge = 6 - 4 - (1/2 × 4) = 6 - 4 - 2 = 0\n\n6. Hydrogen (H) in COOH:\nValence electrons: 1 (for hydrogen)\nNon-bonding electrons: 0 (all electrons are involved in bonding)\nBonding electrons: 2 (1 single bond with O1)\nFormal charge = 1 - 0 - (1/2 × 2) = 1 - 1 = 0\n\nSo, the formal charges of the atoms in the CH3COOH molecule are:\nC1: 0\nH (in CH3): 0\nC2: 0\nO1 (single bond): +1\nO2 (double bond): 0\nH (in COOH): 0\n\nThe significance of the formal charges in this molecule is that they help to determine the stability and reactivity of the molecule. In this case, the oxygen atom with a formal charge of +1 indicates that it is more reactive and can participate in chemical reactions, such as donating a proton (H+) in acidic conditions. This is consistent with the acidic nature of acetic acid (CH3COOH)."
