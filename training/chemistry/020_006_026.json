    "message_2": "To find the new equilibrium constant, we need to divide the initial equilibrium constant by the factor of decrease due to the lower temperature.\n\nInitial equilibrium constant (K1) = 4.34 x 10^-3\nFactor of decrease = 2.5\n\nNew equilibrium constant (K2) = K1 / Factor of decrease\nK2 = (4.34 x 10^-3) / 2.5\n\nK2 = 1.736 x 10^-3\n\nThe new equilibrium constant for the reaction at the lower temperature is 1.736 x 10^-3."
