The balanced equation for the combustion of butane is:\n\n2C4H10(g) + 13O2(g) → 8CO2(g) + 10H2O(l) + heat.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of butane, we will use the following equation:\n\nΔH_combustion = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH_combustion is the enthalpy change for the combustion of butane, ΔH_f(products) is the sum of the heats of formation of the products, and ΔH_f(reactants) is the sum of the heats of formation of the reactants.\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we have:\n\n2C4H10(g) + 13O2(g) → 8CO2(g) + 10H2O(l)\n\nFirst, let's find the sum of the heats of formation of the products:\n\n8 moles CO2 * (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 10 moles H2O * (-285.8 kJ/mol) = -3148 kJ - 2858 kJ = -6006 kJ\n\nNow, let's find the sum of the heats of formation of the reactants:\n\n2 moles C4H10 * (-126 kJ/mol) + 13 moles O2 * 0 kJ/mol = -252 kJ\n\nNote that the heat of formation of O2 is 0 kJ/mol because it is in its standard state.\n\nNow, we can find the enthalpy change for the combustion of butane:\n\nΔH_combustion = -6006 kJ - (-252 kJ) = -5754 kJ\n\nSince the balanced equation involves 2 moles of butane, we need to divide the enthalpy change by 2 to find the enthalpy change per mole of butane:\n\nΔH_combustion per mole of butane = -5754 kJ / 2 = -2877 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy change for the combustion of butane is -2877 kJ/mol."
