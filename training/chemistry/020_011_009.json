    "message_1": "What is the effect on the equilibrium position of the acid-base reaction H2O + NH3 â‡Œ NH4+ + OH- when the pH of the solution is decreased from 7 to 4?",
    "message_2": "When the pH of the solution is decreased from 7 to 4, it means that the concentration of H+ ions in the solution has increased. This increase in H+ ions will cause the equilibrium to shift according to Le Chatelier's principle, which states that when a change is applied to a system in equilibrium, the system will adjust to counteract the change and re-establish equilibrium.\n\nIn this case, the increase in H+ ions will cause the equilibrium to shift to the left, favoring the reactants (H2O and NH3). This is because the reaction will consume the excess H+ ions by forming NH4+ and OH- ions. As a result, the concentration of NH4+ and OH- ions will decrease, while the concentration of H2O and NH3 will increase. This shift in equilibrium will help to counteract the decrease in pH and maintain the acid-base balance in the solution."
