Provide a step-by-step calculation for a surface area of 2.5 cm², a pressure of 2.0 atm, and a Langmuir Constant of 0.005 L/mole.",
    "message_2": "The Langmuir Adsorption Isotherm equation is given by:\n\nθ = (KP) / (1 + KP)\n\nwhere θ is the fractional coverage of the surface (the ratio of the number of adsorbed molecules to the total number of adsorption sites), K is the Langmuir constant (in L/mole), and P is the pressure (in atm).\n\nStep 1: Calculate the fractional coverage (θ) using the given values of K and P.\n\nθ = (0.005 L/mole * 2.0 atm) / (1 + 0.005 L/mole * 2.0 atm)\nθ = 0.01 / 1.01\nθ ≈ 0.0099\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of adsorption sites (N) on the surface using the surface area and a typical value for the surface area per adsorption site. For simplicity, we will assume that each adsorption site occupies an area of 1 nm² (1 x 10^(-18) cm²).\n\nN = (2.5 cm²) / (1 x 10^(-18) cm²/site)\nN ≈ 2.5 x 10^18 sites\n\nStep 3: Calculate the number of adsorbed molecules (n) using the fractional coverage (θ) and the number of adsorption sites (N).\n\nn = θ * N\nn ≈ 0.0099 * 2.5 x 10^18\nn ≈ 2.475 x 10^17 molecules\n\nStep 4: Convert the number of adsorbed molecules (n) to moles using Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23 molecules/mole).\n\nmoles = n / Avogadro's number\nmoles ≈ 2.475 x 10^17 molecules / 6.022 x 10^23 molecules/mole\nmoles ≈ 4.11 x 10^(-7) moles\n\nTherefore, the maximum amount of gas that can be adsorbed on the surface of the solid at the given temperature and pressure is approximately 4.11 x 10^(-7) moles."
