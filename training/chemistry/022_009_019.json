    "message_2": "When potassium iodide (KI) and lead(II) nitrate (Pb(NO3)2) undergo a double replacement reaction, the products formed will be potassium nitrate (KNO3) and lead(II) iodide (PbI2). The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\n2 KI (aq) + Pb(NO3)2 (aq) â†’ 2 KNO3 (aq) + PbI2 (s)\n\nIn this equation, (aq) represents the aqueous state, meaning the compound is dissolved in water, and (s) represents the solid state. So, potassium iodide and lead(II) nitrate are both in aqueous states, while potassium nitrate is in an aqueous state and lead(II) iodide is in a solid state."
