    "message_1": "What is the effect of adding a catalyst on the equilibrium position of a redox reaction and how would you calculate the change in equilibrium concentration of products and reactants? Provide an example of a redox reaction and its equilibrium constant (Kc) value before and after the addition of a catalyst. Also, explain the role of a catalyst in shifting the equilibrium position of a reaction.",
    "message_2": "A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction by lowering the activation energy without being consumed in the reaction. However, it is important to note that a catalyst does not affect the equilibrium position of a reaction. It only accelerates the rate at which the reaction reaches equilibrium. This means that the equilibrium constant (Kc) remains unchanged with the addition of a catalyst.\n\nSince the equilibrium constant remains the same, there is no need to calculate the change in equilibrium concentrations of products and reactants after adding a catalyst. The concentrations will still follow the same equilibrium expression as before.\n\nFor example, let's consider the redox reaction between hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and iodide ions (I-) to form water (H2O) and iodine (I2):\n\n2 H2O2 (aq) + 2 I- (aq) â‡Œ 2 H2O (l) + I2 (aq)\n\nSuppose the equilibrium constant (Kc) for this reaction is 100. If a catalyst, such as iron(III) ions (Fe3+), is added to the reaction, it will increase the rate at which the reaction reaches equilibrium, but the Kc value will still remain 100.\n\nTo reiterate, a catalyst does not shift the equilibrium position of a reaction. It only speeds up the rate at which the reaction reaches equilibrium. The equilibrium concentrations of products and reactants, as well as the Kc value, remain unchanged with the addition of a catalyst."
