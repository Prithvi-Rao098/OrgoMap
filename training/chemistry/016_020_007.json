    "message_1": "A researcher is working on the desorption of a specific gas from a metal surface. The enthalpy of desorption for this process is -23.4 kJ/mol. If the researcher desorbs 0.75 moles of the gas, how much heat is released (or absorbed)?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the heat released or absorbed during the desorption process, we can use the following formula:\n\nq = n * ΔH\n\nwhere q is the heat released or absorbed, n is the number of moles, and ΔH is the enthalpy of desorption.\n\nIn this case, n = 0.75 moles and ΔH = -23.4 kJ/mol.\n\nq = 0.75 moles * (-23.4 kJ/mol) = -17.55 kJ\n\nSince the value of q is negative, it means that 17.55 kJ of heat is released during the desorption process."
