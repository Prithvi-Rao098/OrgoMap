C(s) + O2(g) -> CO2(g)                ΔH = -393.5 kJ/mol\n2. 2CO2(g) -> 2CO(g) + O2(g)       ΔH = +566.0 kJ/mol\n3. C(s) + 2H2(g) -> CH4(g)           ΔH = -74.5 kJ/mol\n\nUse Hess's Law to calculate the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the reaction:\n\nCH4(g) + 2O2(g) -> CO2(g) + 2H2O(g)",
    "message_2": "To use Hess's Law, we need to manipulate the given reactions so that they add up to the desired reaction. Here's how we can do that:\n\n1. Reverse reaction 3 and multiply by 2:\n   2CH4(g) -> 2C(s) + 4H2(g)           ΔH = +149.0 kJ/mol\n\n2. Use reaction 1 as it is:\n   C(s) + O2(g) -> CO2(g)                ΔH = -393.5 kJ/mol\n\n3. We need to form 2H2O(g) from the available H2(g) and O2(g). We can write the formation reaction for H2O(g) and multiply it by 2:\n   2H2(g) + O2(g) -> 2H2O(g)           ΔH = ? (Let's call this ΔHf)\n\nNow, we can add these reactions together:\n\n2CH4(g) -> 2C(s) + 4H2(g)           ΔH = +149.0 kJ/mol\nC(s) + O2(g) -> CO2(g)                ΔH = -393.5 kJ/mol\n2H2(g) + O2(g) -> 2H2O(g)           ΔH = ΔHf\n\nAdding these reactions, we get:\n\nCH4(g) + 2O2(g) -> CO2(g) + 2H2O(g)\n\nNow, we can add the enthalpy changes:\n\nΔH = +149.0 kJ/mol - 393.5 kJ/mol + ΔHf\n\nTo find ΔHf, we can use the enthalpy of formation of H2O(g), which is -241.8 kJ/mol:\n\nΔHf = 2 * (-241.8 kJ/mol) = -483.6 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can substitute this value back into the equation:\n\nΔH = +149.0 kJ/mol - 393.5 kJ/mol - 483.6 kJ/mol\n\nΔH = -728.1 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the reaction CH4(g) + 2O2(g) -> CO2(g) + 2H2O(g) is -728.1 kJ/mol."
