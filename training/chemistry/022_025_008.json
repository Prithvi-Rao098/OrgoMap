    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of molarity and the balanced chemical equation for the neutralization reaction between NaOH and HCl:\n\nNaOH + HCl → NaCl + H2O\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of NaOH reacts with 1 mole of HCl.\n\nNext, we can use the formula:\n\nmoles = molarity × volume\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of HCl in the 25 mL of 0.15 M HCl solution:\n\nmoles of HCl = (0.15 mol/L) × (25 mL × (1 L / 1000 mL))\nmoles of HCl = 0.00375 mol\n\nSince 1 mole of NaOH reacts with 1 mole of HCl, we need 0.00375 moles of NaOH to neutralize the HCl solution.\n\nNow, we can find the volume of 0.1 M NaOH solution needed:\n\nvolume of NaOH = moles of NaOH / molarity of NaOH\nvolume of NaOH = 0.00375 mol / 0.1 mol/L\nvolume of NaOH = 0.0375 L\n\nTo convert the volume to milliliters:\n\nvolume of NaOH = 0.0375 L × (1000 mL / 1 L)\nvolume of NaOH = 37.5 mL\n\nSo, 37.5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH solution is required to neutralize 25 mL of 0.15 M HCl solution."
