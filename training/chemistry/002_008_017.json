    "message_2": "To find the percent composition of sodium chloride (NaCl), we need to determine the mass of each element (sodium and chlorine) and then divide it by the total mass of the compound. Here's how to do it:\n\n1. Find the molar mass of each element in the compound:\n- Sodium (Na): 22.99 g/mol\n- Chlorine (Cl): 35.45 g/mol\n\n2. Add the molar masses to find the molar mass of the compound (NaCl):\nMolar mass of NaCl = (22.99 g/mol) + (35.45 g/mol) = 58.44 g/mol\n\n3. Calculate the percent composition of each element:\n- Percent composition of sodium (Na):\n  (Mass of Na / Molar mass of NaCl) x 100\n  (22.99 g/mol / 58.44 g/mol) x 100 = 39.34%\n\n- Percent composition of chlorine (Cl):\n  (Mass of Cl / Molar mass of NaCl) x 100\n  (35.45 g/mol / 58.44 g/mol) x 100 = 60.66%\n\nSo, the percent composition of sodium chloride (NaCl) is approximately 39.34% sodium (Na) and 60.66% chlorine (Cl)."
