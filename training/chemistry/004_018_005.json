    "message_1": "A chemistry student has a sample of an unknown compound containing carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. The mass of the sample is 2.50 g. After combustion, the student finds that 1.80 g of carbon dioxide, 0.75 g of water, and 0.20 g of oxygen are produced. Using mass balance calculations, determine the empirical formula of the unknown compound.",
    "message_2": "To determine the empirical formula of the unknown compound, we first need to find the moles of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in the compound.\n\n1. Calculate the moles of carbon and hydrogen from the combustion products:\n\n1.80 g of CO₂ (molar mass = 44.01 g/mol):\nmoles of C = (1.80 g) / (44.01 g/mol) = 0.0409 mol\n\n0.75 g of H₂O (molar mass = 18.02 g/mol):\nmoles of H = 2 * (0.75 g) / (18.02 g/mol) = 0.0833 mol\n\n2. Calculate the moles of oxygen in the compound:\n\nThe 0.20 g of oxygen produced during combustion was originally part of the compound. To find the moles of oxygen, we use the molar mass of oxygen (16.00 g/mol):\n\nmoles of O = (0.20 g) / (16.00 g/mol) = 0.0125 mol\n\n3. Determine the empirical formula:\n\nDivide the moles of each element by the smallest number of moles to find the mole ratio:\n\nC: 0.0409 / 0.0125 = 3.27 ≈ 3\nH: 0.0833 / 0.0125 = 6.66 ≈ 7\nO: 0.0125 / 0.0125 = 1\n\nThe empirical formula of the unknown compound is C₃H₇O."
