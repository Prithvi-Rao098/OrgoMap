    "message_2": "To determine the new solubility of silver chloride (AgCl) when the concentration of sodium chloride (NaCl) is increased from 0.1 M to 0.5 M, we need to consider the common ion effect. The common ion effect states that the solubility of a sparingly soluble salt is decreased in the presence of a common ion.\n\nThe solubility product constant (Ksp) expression for silver chloride is:\n\nKsp = [Ag+][Cl-]\n\nSince NaCl is a strong electrolyte, it will completely dissociate in water, and the concentration of Cl- ions will increase from 0.1 M to 0.5 M. \n\nLet's assume the new solubility of AgCl is \"s\" moles per liter. When AgCl dissolves, it will produce \"s\" moles of Ag+ ions and \"s\" moles of Cl- ions. However, we already have 0.5 M Cl- ions from NaCl. So, the total concentration of Cl- ions will be (0.5 + s) M.\n\nNow, we can write the Ksp expression with the new concentrations:\n\nKsp = [Ag+][Cl-] = [s][(0.5 + s)]\n\nGiven that the Ksp of AgCl is 1.8 × 10^-10 at 25°C:\n\n1.8 × 10^-10 = [s][(0.5 + s)]\n\nSince Ksp is very small and the concentration of Cl- ions from NaCl is significantly larger than the solubility of AgCl, we can assume that s is much smaller than 0.5. Therefore, we can approximate (0.5 + s) as 0.5:\n\n1.8 × 10^-10 = [s][0.5]\n\nNow, we can solve for s:\n\ns = (1.8 × 10^-10) / 0.5\ns = 3.6 × 10^-10 M\n\nSo, the new solubility of silver chloride when the concentration of sodium chloride is increased from 0.1 M to 0.5 M at 25°C is approximately 3.6 × 10^-10 M."
