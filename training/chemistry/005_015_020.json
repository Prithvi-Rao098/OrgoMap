    "message_2": "In a eukaryotic cell, the complete oxidation of one glucose molecule through glycolysis, the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle), and oxidative phosphorylation produces a net total of approximately 36 to 38 ATP molecules. The breakdown is as follows:\n\n1. Glycolysis: 2 ATP (net) and 2 NADH are produced per glucose molecule.\n2. Pyruvate decarboxylation: 2 NADH are produced per glucose molecule (1 per pyruvate).\n3. Citric acid cycle: 2 ATP, 6 NADH, and 2 FADH2 are produced per glucose molecule (1 ATP, 3 NADH, and 1 FADH2 per turn of the cycle, and the cycle turns twice per glucose molecule).\n\nNow, considering the oxidative phosphorylation through the electron transport chain:\n1. Each NADH molecule generates approximately 2.5 ATP molecules.\n2. Each FADH2 molecule generates approximately 1.5 ATP molecules.\n\nSo, the total ATP production is:\n- Glycolysis: 2 ATP\n- Citric acid cycle: 2 ATP\n- Oxidative phosphorylation: (10 NADH × 2.5 ATP/NADH) + (2 FADH2 × 1.5 ATP/FADH2) = 25 ATP + 3 ATP = 28 ATP\n\nAdding all these values together, we get a total of 2 ATP (glycolysis) + 2 ATP (citric acid cycle) + 28 ATP (oxidative phosphorylation) = 32 ATP molecules. However, in eukaryotic cells, the transport of 2 NADH molecules produced in glycolysis from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria consumes 2 ATP molecules. Therefore, the net total of ATP molecules produced per glucose molecule in a eukaryotic cell is approximately 30 to 32 ATP molecules. The range (36-38 ATP) mentioned earlier is due to variations in the efficiency of the electron transport chain and the transport of NADH into the mitochondria."
