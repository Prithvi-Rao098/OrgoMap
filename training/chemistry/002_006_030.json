    "message_2": "To find the molar mass of magnesium chloride (MgCl2), we need to add the molar masses of magnesium (Mg) and two chlorine (Cl) atoms.\n\nThe molar mass of magnesium (Mg) is approximately 24.305 g/mol.\nThe molar mass of chlorine (Cl) is approximately 35.453 g/mol.\n\nSince there are two chlorine atoms in MgCl2, we need to multiply the molar mass of chlorine by 2:\n\n2 * 35.453 g/mol = 70.906 g/mol\n\nNow, add the molar mass of magnesium to the total molar mass of the two chlorine atoms:\n\n24.305 g/mol (Mg) + 70.906 g/mol (2 Cl) = 95.211 g/mol\n\nThe molar mass of magnesium chloride (MgCl2) is approximately 95.211 g/mol."
