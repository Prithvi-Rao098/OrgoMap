    "message_2": "To find the percent composition of sodium chloride (NaCl), we first need to determine the total mass of the compound and then find the mass percentage of each element.\n\n1. Calculate the total mass of the compound:\nTotal mass = mass of sodium + mass of chlorine\nTotal mass = 6.95 g (sodium) + 10.55 g (chlorine)\nTotal mass = 17.50 g\n\n2. Calculate the mass percentage of each element:\nMass percentage of sodium (Na) = (mass of sodium / total mass) × 100\nMass percentage of Na = (6.95 g / 17.50 g) × 100\nMass percentage of Na ≈ 39.71%\n\nMass percentage of chlorine (Cl) = (mass of chlorine / total mass) × 100\nMass percentage of Cl = (10.55 g / 17.50 g) × 100\nMass percentage of Cl ≈ 60.29%\n\nThe percent composition of sodium chloride (NaCl) is approximately 39.71% sodium (Na) and 60.29% chlorine (Cl)."
