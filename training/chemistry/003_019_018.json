    "message_2": "To determine the molecular structure of the unknown compound X (C4H8O2) with a boiling point of 165°C, we will use both proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy and carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR) spectroscopy.\n\n1H NMR spectroscopy provides information about the hydrogen atoms in the molecule, such as their chemical environment and how they are connected to the carbon atoms. 13C NMR spectroscopy provides information about the carbon atoms in the molecule, including their chemical environment and connectivity.\n\nStep 1: Obtain the 1H NMR spectrum of the unknown compound X\nFirst, dissolve the compound in an appropriate deuterated solvent, such as deuterated chloroform (CDCl3), and place the sample in an NMR tube. Then, run the 1H NMR experiment using an NMR spectrometer. The resulting spectrum will display peaks corresponding to the different hydrogen environments in the molecule.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the 1H NMR spectrum\nExamine the spectrum and identify the number of peaks, their chemical shifts, integration values, and splitting patterns. This information will help determine the different hydrogen environments and their connectivity in the molecule.\n\nStep 3: Obtain the 13C NMR spectrum of the unknown compound X\nUsing the same sample, run the 13C NMR experiment using an NMR spectrometer. The resulting spectrum will display peaks corresponding to the different carbon environments in the molecule.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the 13C NMR spectrum\nExamine the spectrum and identify the number of peaks and their chemical shifts. This information will help determine the different carbon environments and their connectivity in the molecule.\n\nStep 5: Combine the information from both 1H and 13C NMR spectra\nUsing the data obtained from both the 1H and 13C NMR spectra, propose a molecular structure for the unknown compound X that is consistent with the observed chemical shifts, integration values, and splitting patterns.\n\nFor example, if the 1H NMR spectrum shows a peak with a chemical shift around 2 ppm (typical for a methyl group next to a carbonyl group) and the 13C NMR spectrum shows a peak around 170 ppm (typical for a carbonyl carbon), this suggests the presence of an ester functional group in the molecule.\n\nStep 6: Verify the proposed structure\nCompare the proposed structure with the given molecular formula (C4H8O2) and boiling point (165°C). If the proposed structure is consistent with this information, it is likely the correct structure for the unknown compound X.\n\nIn conclusion, by analyzing the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the unknown compound X, we can propose a molecular structure that is consistent with the given molecular formula and boiling point. This process allows us to determine the molecular structure of the compound using magnetic resonance spectroscopy."
