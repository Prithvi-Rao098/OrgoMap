    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the formation of water vapor (H2O(g)) from hydrogen gas (H2(g)) and oxygen gas (O2(g)), we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH°(reaction) = Σ [ΔH°f(products)] - Σ [ΔH°f(reactants)]\n\nwhere ΔH°(reaction) is the standard enthalpy change for the reaction, ΔH°f(products) are the standard enthalpies of formation for the products, and ΔH°f(reactants) are the standard enthalpies of formation for the reactants.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the formation of water vapor is:\n\nH2(g) + 1/2 O2(g) → H2O(g)\n\nThe standard enthalpies of formation (ΔH°f) for H2(g), O2(g), and H2O(g) are as follows:\n\nΔH°f(H2(g)) = 0 kJ/mol (since H2 is an element in its standard state)\nΔH°f(O2(g)) = 0 kJ/mol (since O2 is an element in its standard state)\nΔH°f(H2O(g)) = -241.8 kJ/mol (from reference tables)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔH°(reaction) = [ΔH°f(H2O(g))] - [ΔH°f(H2(g)) + 1/2 ΔH°f(O2(g))]\nΔH°(reaction) = [-241.8 kJ/mol] - [0 kJ/mol + 1/2 × 0 kJ/mol]\nΔH°(reaction) = -241.8 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the formation of water vapor (H2O(g)) from hydrogen gas (H2(g)) and oxygen gas (O2(g)) at a temperature of 298 K and a pressure of 1 atm is -241.8 kJ/mol."
