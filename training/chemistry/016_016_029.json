    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the reduction of iron(III) oxide to iron using hydrogen gas, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nFe2O3 (s) + 3 H2 (g) → 2 Fe (s) + 3 H2O (l)\n\nNow, we can use Hess's Law to find the enthalpy change for the reaction. Hess's Law states that the enthalpy change for a reaction is equal to the sum of the enthalpy changes for the formation of the products minus the sum of the enthalpy changes for the formation of the reactants.\n\nΔH(reaction) = Σ ΔH(products) - Σ ΔH(reactants)\n\nIn this case, the products are 2 moles of Fe and 3 moles of H2O, and the reactants are 1 mole of Fe2O3 and 3 moles of H2. The standard enthalpy of formation for Fe2O3 is -824 kJ/mol, and for H2O is -286 kJ/mol. The standard enthalpy of formation for elements in their standard state, such as Fe (s) and H2 (g), is zero.\n\nΔH(reaction) = [(2 × 0) + (3 × -286)] - [(1 × -824) + (3 × 0)]\n\nΔH(reaction) = [-858] - [-824]\n\nΔH(reaction) = -34 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change for the reduction of iron(III) oxide to iron using hydrogen gas is -34 kJ."
