    "message_2": "To calculate the lattice energy of calcium oxide (CaO), we can use the Born-Lande equation:\n\nLattice Energy = (Madelung constant * charge of cation * charge of anion * e^2) / (4 * π * ε₀ * r₀)\n\nwhere:\n- Madelung constant = 1.74\n- charge of cation (Ca) = +2\n- charge of anion (O) = -2\n- e = 1.602 x 10^(-19) C (elementary charge)\n- ε₀ = 8.854 x 10^(-12) C²/N·m² (vacuum permittivity)\n- r₀ = 2.36 Å = 2.36 x 10^(-10) m (distance between ions)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the equation:\n\nLattice Energy = (1.74 * 2 * 2 * (1.602 x 10^(-19))^2) / (4 * π * (8.854 x 10^(-12)) * (2.36 x 10^(-10)))\n\nLattice Energy = (1.74 * 4 * (2.566 x 10^(-38))) / (4 * π * (8.854 x 10^(-12)) * (2.36 x 10^(-10)))\n\nLattice Energy = (6.984 x 10^(-38)) / (9.425 x 10^(-22))\n\nLattice Energy ≈ 7.41 x 10^16 N·m\n\nThe lattice energy of calcium oxide (CaO) is approximately 7.41 x 10^16 N·m."
