    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (K) for the given redox reaction, we first need to determine the concentration of Sn⁴⁺ at equilibrium. We can do this by using the stoichiometry of the balanced equation.\n\nSince 2 moles of Fe³⁺ react with 1 mole of Sn²⁺ to produce 2 moles of Fe²⁺ and 1 mole of Sn⁴⁺, we can set up the following relationships:\n\nInitial concentrations:\n[Fe³⁺] = 0.10 M\n[Sn²⁺] = 0.20 M\n[Fe²⁺] = 0 M (assuming no Fe²⁺ initially)\n[Sn⁴⁺] = 0 M (assuming no Sn⁴⁺ initially)\n\nLet x be the change in concentration for Fe³⁺ and Sn²⁺ at equilibrium:\n[Fe³⁺] = 0.10 - 2x\n[Sn²⁺] = 0.20 - x\n[Fe²⁺] = 0 + 2x\n[Sn⁴⁺] = 0 + x\n\nWe are given that the concentration of Fe²⁺ at equilibrium is 0.04 M:\n0.04 = 2x\nx = 0.02\n\nNow we can find the equilibrium concentrations of all species:\n[Fe³⁺] = 0.10 - 2(0.02) = 0.06 M\n[Sn²⁺] = 0.20 - 0.02 = 0.18 M\n[Fe²⁺] = 0.04 M\n[Sn⁴⁺] = 0.02 M\n\nNow we can find the equilibrium constant (K) using the expression for the reaction:\n\nK = ([Fe²⁺]^2 * [Sn⁴⁺]) / ([Fe³⁺]^2 * [Sn²⁺])\n\nK = ((0.04)^2 * (0.02)) / ((0.06)^2 * (0.18))\n\nK = (0.0016 * 0.02) / (0.0036 * 0.18)\n\nK = 0.000032 / 0.000648\n\nK ≈ 0.049\n\nThe equilibrium constant for the given redox reaction is approximately 0.049."
