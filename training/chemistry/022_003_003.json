    "message_2": "The balanced chemical equation for the neutralization reaction between nitric acid (HNO3) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is:\n\nHNO3 (aq) + NaOH (aq) â†’ NaNO3 (aq) + H2O (l)\n\nIn this reaction, one mole of nitric acid reacts with one mole of sodium hydroxide to produce one mole of sodium nitrate and one mole of water.\n\nGiven that 0.25 moles of nitric acid reacts with excess sodium hydroxide, the number of moles of sodium nitrate produced will be equal to the number of moles of nitric acid reacted, which is 0.25 moles.\n\nSo, 0.25 moles of sodium nitrate (NaNO3) will be produced in this reaction."
