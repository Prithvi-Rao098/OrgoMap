    "message_1": "How will the equilibrium position of the reaction below be affected by the addition of more reactant (N2) to the system?\n3H2(g) + N2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g) \n\nExplain your answer with the appropriate chemical equation and Le Chatelier's Principle.",
    "message_2": "When more reactant (N2) is added to the system, the equilibrium position will shift to counteract the change and restore equilibrium. According to Le Chatelier's Principle, if a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in concentration, temperature, or pressure, the system will adjust the position of the equilibrium to counteract the change.\n\nIn this case, the addition of more N2 will cause the equilibrium to shift to the right, towards the formation of more NH3. This is because the system will try to consume the excess N2 by producing more NH3. The chemical equation remains the same:\n\n3H2(g) + N2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g)\n\nIn summary, adding more N2 to the system will shift the equilibrium position to the right, favoring the formation of NH3, in accordance with Le Chatelier's Principle."
