    "message_1": "What is the equilibrium constant expression for the reaction between nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas that produces ammonia gas? Given the initial concentrations of nitrogen gas, hydrogen gas, and ammonia gas as 0.25 M, 0.15 M, and 0 M respectively, calculate the equilibrium constant for the reaction at 25°C.",
    "message_2": "The balanced chemical equation for the synthesis of ammonia gas from nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas is:\n\nN₂(g) + 3H₂(g) ⇌ 2NH₃(g)\n\nTo write the equilibrium constant expression (Kc) for this reaction, we need to consider the concentrations of the reactants and products raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients:\n\nKc = [NH₃]^2 / ([N₂] * [H₂]^3)\n\nGiven the initial concentrations of nitrogen gas (N₂) as 0.25 M, hydrogen gas (H₂) as 0.15 M, and ammonia gas (NH₃) as 0 M, we can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations:\n\n          N₂(g)   +   3H₂(g)   ⇌   2NH₃(g)\nInitial:  0.25 M       0.15 M         0 M\nChange:  -x M        -3x M          +2x M\nEquilibrium: 0.25-x M  0.15-3x M     2x M\n\nHowever, we need the equilibrium constant (Kc) to solve for x and find the equilibrium concentrations. Since we don't have the value of Kc, we cannot calculate the equilibrium concentrations or the value of Kc at 25°C."
