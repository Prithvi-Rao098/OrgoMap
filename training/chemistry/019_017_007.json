    "message_1": "What is the standard enthalpy change of sublimation for solid iodine at 25°C and 1 atm, given the following data:\n- enthalpy of fusion of solid iodine = 15.52 kJ/mol\n- enthalpy of vaporization of liquid iodine = 41.57 kJ/mol\n- specific heat capacity of solid iodine = 42.6 J/(mol·K)\n- specific heat capacity of gaseous iodine = 36.3 J/(mol·K)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change of sublimation for solid iodine at 25°C and 1 atm, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH_sublimation = ΔH_fusion + ΔH_vaporization\n\nGiven the enthalpy of fusion (ΔH_fusion) of solid iodine is 15.52 kJ/mol and the enthalpy of vaporization (ΔH_vaporization) of liquid iodine is 41.57 kJ/mol, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔH_sublimation = 15.52 kJ/mol + 41.57 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_sublimation = 57.09 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change of sublimation for solid iodine at 25°C and 1 atm is 57.09 kJ/mol."
