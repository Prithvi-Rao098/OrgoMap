    "message_1": "What is the surface area of a certain solid substance if it has absorbed 1.5 moles of gas under specific temperature and pressure conditions using the BET theory of multilayer adsorption, given that the gas has a known monolayer capacity and the weight of the sample?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the surface area of a solid substance using the BET (Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller) theory of multilayer adsorption, we need to know the monolayer capacity (Vm) and the weight of the sample (W). Additionally, we need to know the cross-sectional area of the adsorbed gas molecule (σ). The surface area (SA) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nSA = (Vm * N * σ) / W\n\nWhere:\n- SA is the surface area of the solid substance\n- Vm is the monolayer capacity (in moles)\n- N is Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23 molecules/mol)\n- σ is the cross-sectional area of the adsorbed gas molecule (in square meters)\n- W is the weight of the sample (in grams)\n\nHowever, the problem states that 1.5 moles of gas have been absorbed, but it does not provide the monolayer capacity (Vm), the weight of the sample (W), or the cross-sectional area of the adsorbed gas molecule (σ). \n\nTo solve the problem, please provide the missing information (Vm, W, and σ)."
