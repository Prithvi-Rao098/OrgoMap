    "message_2": "The most efficient and environmentally friendly method for disposing of radioactive waste is deep geological repositories (DGRs). This method involves storing the waste in stable rock formations deep underground, typically at depths of 300 to 1,000 meters. The waste is stored in multiple layers of engineered and natural barriers to ensure long-term isolation from the biosphere.\n\nTo minimize the impact of radioactive waste on the environment, several measures can be taken:\n\n1. Waste minimization: Reducing the volume of radioactive waste generated by optimizing nuclear processes, recycling materials, and using advanced technologies.\n\n2. Waste classification: Properly classifying radioactive waste according to its level of radioactivity and hazard potential ensures that the appropriate disposal method is used.\n\n3. Waste treatment and conditioning: Treating and conditioning the waste to reduce its volume, stabilize its chemical form, and make it more resistant to environmental factors.\n\n4. Monitoring and surveillance: Regular monitoring and surveillance of the disposal sites are essential to ensure the long-term safety of the environment and human health.\n\n5. Public engagement and transparency: Engaging with the public and maintaining transparency in the decision-making process can help build trust and address concerns about the safety and environmental impact of radioactive waste disposal.\n\n6. International cooperation: Collaborating with other countries and international organizations to share knowledge, best practices, and technologies can help improve the overall safety and efficiency of radioactive waste management."
