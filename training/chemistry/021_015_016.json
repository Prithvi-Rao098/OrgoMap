    "message_2": "The molecular geometry of a water molecule (H2O) is bent or V-shaped. This is due to the presence of two lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen atom, which repel the bonding pairs of electrons between the oxygen and hydrogen atoms. The bond angle between the two hydrogen atoms and the oxygen atom in a water molecule is approximately 104.5 degrees. This is smaller than the typical tetrahedral angle of 109.5 degrees because the lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen atom take up more space and repel the bonding pairs, causing the hydrogen-oxygen-hydrogen angle to be compressed."
