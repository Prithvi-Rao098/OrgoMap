    "message_2": "To calculate the specific heat capacity (c) of water, we can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat absorbed (400 J), m is the mass of water, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature (20°C).\n\nWe need to know the mass of water to calculate the specific heat capacity. Assuming we have 100 grams of water, we can rearrange the formula to solve for c:\n\nc = q / (mΔT)\n\nc = 400 J / (100 g × 20°C)\n\nc = 400 J / 2000 g°C\n\nc = 0.2 J/g°C\n\nSo, the specific heat capacity of water in this case is 0.2 J/g°C. However, it's important to note that the specific heat capacity of water is generally known to be 4.18 J/g°C. The calculated value may be different due to experimental errors or inaccuracies in the given data."
