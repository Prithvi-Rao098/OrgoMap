    "message_2": "The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory is a widely used method for calculating the surface area of solid adsorbent materials. The BET equation is given by:\n\nN = (N_m * C * P) / [(1 - P) * (1 + (C - 1) * P)]\n\nwhere N is the amount of gas adsorbed at a given pressure P, N_m is the amount of gas adsorbed in a monolayer, and C is the BET constant.\n\nFirst, we need to find the amount of gas adsorbed in a monolayer (N_m). We are given that the number of monolayers formed is 4. Therefore, the total amount of gas adsorbed (N_total) can be calculated as:\n\nN_total = N_m * 4\n\nNow, we can use the BET equation to find N_m:\n\nN_m = (N_total * (1 - P) * (1 + (C - 1) * P)) / (C * P)\n\nWe are given the value of the BET constant (C = 0.05). However, we do not have the value of the pressure P. In order to solve this problem, we need more information about the adsorption isotherm, such as the pressure at which the adsorption occurs or the relationship between the amount of gas adsorbed and the pressure.\n\nAssuming we have the value of N_m, we can then calculate the surface area of the solid adsorbent material using the following equation:\n\nSurface area = (N_m * area occupied by each adsorbed layer * Avogadro's number) / mass of the adsorbent material\n\nwhere Avogadro's number is 6.022 x 10^23 molecules/mol.\n\nOnce we have the value of N_m, we can plug it into this equation along with the given values to find the surface area of the solid adsorbent material."
