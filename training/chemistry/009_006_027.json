    "message_2": "A carbon atom has 6 protons, and in this case, it has 8 neutrons. The nuclear notation of this carbon isotope is written as:\n\n¹⁴C\n\nHere, the superscript 14 (6 protons + 8 neutrons) represents the mass number (total number of protons and neutrons), and C is the atomic symbol for carbon."
