    "message_2": "To find the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid, we can use the formula for the dissociation constant (Ka) and the definition of pH.\n\nThe dissociation of acetic acid (CH3COOH) in water can be represented as:\n\nCH3COOH ⇌ CH3COO- + H+\n\nThe Ka expression for this reaction is:\n\nKa = [CH3COO-][H+]/[CH3COOH]\n\nLet x be the concentration of H+ ions (and also CH3COO- ions) at equilibrium. Then, the concentration of CH3COOH at equilibrium will be 0.1 - x. We can now write the Ka expression in terms of x:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 = (x)(x)/(0.1 - x)\n\nSince Ka is very small, we can assume that x is much smaller than 0.1, so we can simplify the equation to:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 ≈ x^2/0.1\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx^2 = 1.8 x 10^-5 * 0.1\nx^2 = 1.8 x 10^-6\nx ≈ 1.34 x 10^-3\n\nSince x represents the concentration of H+ ions, we can now find the pH using the definition of pH:\n\npH = -log[H+]\npH = -log(1.34 x 10^-3)\npH ≈ 2.87\n\nThe pH of the 0.1 M solution of acetic acid is approximately 2.87."
