    "message_2": "First, let's write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3):\n\nHCl (aq) + NaHCO3 (aq) → NaCl (aq) + H2O (l) + CO2 (g)\n\nNow, we need to calculate the moles of NaHCO3 and HCl.\n\nMoles of NaHCO3 = mass / molar mass\nThe molar mass of NaHCO3 = 22.99 (Na) + 1.01 (H) + 12.01 (C) + 16.00 x 3 (O) = 84.01 g/mol\n\nMoles of NaHCO3 = 5 g / 84.01 g/mol = 0.0595 mol\n\nMoles of HCl = Molarity x Volume (in L)\nMoles of HCl = 2 M x 0.050 L = 0.1 mol\n\nNow, we need to determine the limiting reactant. The stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, so we can compare the moles of each reactant directly.\n\nSince there are fewer moles of NaHCO3 (0.0595 mol) than HCl (0.1 mol), NaHCO3 is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow, we can calculate the moles of CO2 produced using the stoichiometry of the balanced equation:\n\n1 mol NaHCO3 → 1 mol CO2\n\nMoles of CO2 produced = 0.0595 mol NaHCO3 x (1 mol CO2 / 1 mol NaHCO3) = 0.0595 mol CO2\n\nAt STP (standard temperature and pressure), 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L. Therefore, we can calculate the volume of CO2 produced:\n\nVolume of CO2 = moles of CO2 x 22.4 L/mol\nVolume of CO2 = 0.0595 mol x 22.4 L/mol = 1.33 L\n\nSo, the volume of carbon dioxide gas produced at STP when 5 grams of NaHCO3 is added to 50 mL of 2 M HCl is approximately 1.33 liters."
