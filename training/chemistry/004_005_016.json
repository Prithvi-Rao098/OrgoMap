    "message_2": "To calculate the pH of a solution with a hydrogen ion concentration of 2.5 x 10^-7 M, we can use the pH formula:\n\npH = -log10[H+]\n\nWhere [H+] is the hydrogen ion concentration.\n\npH = -log10(2.5 x 10^-7)\npH â‰ˆ 6.60\n\nNow, we can determine whether the solution is acidic, neutral, or basic based on the calculated pH value:\n\n- If pH < 7, the solution is acidic.\n- If pH = 7, the solution is neutral.\n- If pH > 7, the solution is basic.\n\nSince the calculated pH is 6.60, which is slightly less than 7, the solution is considered to be weakly acidic."
