    "message_2": "The conductivity of a solution is the ability of the solution to conduct electric current. It depends on the concentration of ions present in the solution. In the case of a solution containing sodium chloride (NaCl), magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), and potassium nitrate (KNO3), increasing the concentration of these salts will increase the number of ions present in the solution.\n\nWhen the concentration of these salts increases, more ions (Na+, Cl-, Mg2+, SO4 2-, K+, and NO3-) are released into the solution. These ions are charged particles that can move freely in the solution, allowing the electric current to pass through it. As a result, the conductivity of the solution increases.\n\nIn summary, increasing the concentration of sodium chloride, magnesium sulfate, and potassium nitrate in a solution will increase its conductivity due to the higher number of ions present in the solution."
