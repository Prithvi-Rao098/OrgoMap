    "message_2": "1. The Lewis structure:\nTo draw the Lewis structure for SF4, we first need to determine the total number of valence electrons. Sulfur (S) has 6 valence electrons, and each of the four fluorine (F) atoms has 7 valence electrons. So, the total number of valence electrons is 6 + (4 Ã— 7) = 34.\n\nThe Lewis structure for SF4 can be drawn as follows:\n\n       F\n       |\nS - F - S - F\n       |\n       F\n\nSulfur is the central atom, surrounded by four fluorine atoms. Sulfur has an expanded octet, with 10 electrons around it (2 electrons in each of the four single bonds and one lone pair). Each fluorine atom is connected to the sulfur atom with a single bond and has three lone pairs.\n\n2. The molecular geometry:\nThe molecular geometry of SF4 can be determined using the VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) theory. The central sulfur atom has a total of five electron groups (four single bonds to fluorine atoms and one lone pair). According to VSEPR theory, these electron groups will arrange themselves to minimize repulsion. In this case, the molecular geometry is \"see-saw\" or \"distorted tetrahedral.\"\n\n3. The polarity of the molecule:\nTo determine the polarity of the molecule, we need to consider the electronegativity difference between the atoms and the molecular geometry. Fluorine is more electronegative than sulfur, so the S-F bonds are polar. However, due to the see-saw molecular geometry, these bond dipoles do not cancel each other out, resulting in a net molecular dipole moment. Therefore, the SF4 molecule is polar."
