    "message_2": "To find the acid dissociation constant (Ka) for a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid (CH3COOH) with a pH of 2.87, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Convert pH to [H+]: \npH = -log[H+]\n2.87 = -log[H+]\n[H+] = 10^(-2.87) = 1.35 x 10^(-3) M\n\n2. Write the dissociation equation for acetic acid:\nCH3COOH ⇌ CH3COO- + H+\n\n3. Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:\n          CH3COOH  CH3COO-   H+\nInitial:   0.1       0        0\nChange:   -x        +x       +x\nEquilibrium: 0.1-x    x        x\n\nSince [H+] = x = 1.35 x 10^(-3) M, we can substitute this value into the equilibrium expression.\n\n4. Write the Ka expression:\nKa = ([CH3COO-][H+])/[CH3COOH]\n\n5. Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the Ka expression:\nKa = (1.35 x 10^(-3) * 1.35 x 10^(-3))/(0.1 - 1.35 x 10^(-3))\n\n6. Solve for Ka:\nKa ≈ 1.82 x 10^(-5)\n\nThe acid dissociation constant (Ka) for a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid (CH3COOH) with a pH of 2.87 is approximately 1.82 x 10^(-5)."
