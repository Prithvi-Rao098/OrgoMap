    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the combustion reaction of ethanol, we need to know the amount of ethanol combusted. Since we are given the heat evolved (1367.6 kJ) and the molar mass of ethanol (46.07 g/mol), we can use these values to find the moles of ethanol combusted and then calculate the standard enthalpy change per mole.\n\nFirst, let's find the moles of ethanol combusted:\n\nHeat evolved = 1367.6 kJ\nMolar mass of ethanol = 46.07 g/mol\nHeat of combustion per gram of ethanol = -1367.6 kJ/mol ÷ 46.07 g/mol = -29.68 kJ/g\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the combustion reaction of ethanol:\n\nΔH° = Heat of combustion per gram of ethanol × Molar mass of ethanol\nΔH° = -29.68 kJ/g × 46.07 g/mol\nΔH° = -1367.6 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the combustion reaction of ethanol is -1367.6 kJ/mol."
