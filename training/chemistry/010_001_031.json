    "message_2": "To calculate the standard electrode potential for the given reaction, we need to find the difference between the reduction potentials of the two half-reactions. Since the given reaction involves the reduction of Cu2+ to Cu and the oxidation of Zn to Zn2+, we need to reverse the Zn2+ to Zn half-reaction to make it an oxidation reaction.\n\nThe standard electrode potential for the reduction of Zn2+ to Zn is -0.76 V. When we reverse the reaction, the sign of the standard electrode potential also changes. So, the standard electrode potential for the oxidation of Zn to Zn2+ is +0.76 V.\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard electrode potential for the overall reaction:\n\nE°(cell) = E°(reduction) - E°(oxidation)\nE°(cell) = E°(Cu2+ to Cu) - E°(Zn to Zn2+)\nE°(cell) = +0.34 V - (+0.76 V)\nE°(cell) = -0.42 V\n\nThe standard electrode potential for the given reaction is -0.42 V."
