    "message_2": "In coordination chemistry, the color changes observed when adding aqueous ammonia to a copper(II) sulfate solution can be explained by the formation of different copper-ammonia complexes.\n\nInitially, copper(II) sulfate (CuSO4) is present in the solution as blue-colored hydrated copper(II) ions [Cu(H2O)6]²⁺. When aqueous ammonia (NH3) is added to the solution, it acts as a ligand and starts to replace the water molecules surrounding the copper(II) ion.\n\nThe first step involves the deprotonation of water molecules by ammonia, forming hydroxide ions (OH⁻):\n\nNH3 + H2O → NH4⁺ + OH⁻\n\nThe hydroxide ions then react with the copper(II) ions to form a light blue precipitate of copper(II) hydroxide (Cu(OH)2):\n\nCu²⁺ + 2OH⁻ → Cu(OH)2(s)\n\nAs more ammonia is added to the solution, it starts to form a complex with the copper(II) ions by replacing the hydroxide ions in the copper(II) hydroxide precipitate. This forms a deep blue-colored tetraamminecopper(II) complex:\n\nCu(OH)2(s) + 4NH3 → [Cu(NH3)4(H2O)2]²⁺ + 2H2O\n\nThe deep blue color of the solution is due to the formation of this tetraamminecopper(II) complex. The ammonia molecules act as ligands and coordinate to the central copper(II) ion through their lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom.\n\nThe color changes observed during this process are a result of the different electronic transitions occurring within the copper complexes. The energy of these transitions, which corresponds to the absorption of specific wavelengths of light, is influenced by the nature of the ligands surrounding the copper(II) ion. As the ligands change from water molecules to ammonia molecules, the energy of the electronic transitions and the absorbed wavelengths of light change, resulting in the observed color changes."
