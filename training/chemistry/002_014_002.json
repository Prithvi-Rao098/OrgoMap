    "message_2": "To calculate the formal charge on the sulfur atom in the compound SO₃²⁻, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the number of valence electrons for the sulfur atom. Sulfur is in group 16 (also known as group 6A) of the periodic table, so it has 6 valence electrons.\n\n2. Calculate the number of bonding electrons. In SO₃²⁻, sulfur is bonded to three oxygen atoms through double bonds. Each double bond consists of 2 bonding pairs, so there are a total of 6 bonding pairs (3 double bonds x 2 bonding pairs per double bond = 6 bonding pairs). Since each bonding pair consists of 2 electrons, there are 12 bonding electrons (6 bonding pairs x 2 electrons per bonding pair = 12 bonding electrons).\n\n3. Calculate the number of non-bonding electrons. In SO₃²⁻, each oxygen atom has two lone pairs of electrons. Since there are three oxygen atoms, there are a total of 6 lone pairs (3 oxygen atoms x 2 lone pairs per oxygen atom = 6 lone pairs). Each lone pair consists of 2 electrons, so there are 12 non-bonding electrons (6 lone pairs x 2 electrons per lone pair = 12 non-bonding electrons).\n\n4. Calculate the formal charge on the sulfur atom using the following formula:\n\nFormal charge = (Number of valence electrons) - (Number of bonding electrons/2) - (Number of non-bonding electrons)\n\nIn this case, the formal charge on the sulfur atom is:\n\nFormal charge = (6) - (12/2) - (0) = 6 - 6 - 0 = 0\n\nTherefore, the formal charge on the sulfur atom in the compound SO₃²⁻ is 0."
