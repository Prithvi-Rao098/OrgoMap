    "message_2": "The bond between oxygen and hydrogen in a water molecule is polar. This is because oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen, meaning it has a greater ability to attract electrons. As a result, the shared electrons in the O-H bond are more attracted to the oxygen atom, creating a partial negative charge (δ-) on the oxygen and a partial positive charge (δ+) on the hydrogen.\n\nWater has a bent molecular geometry, with the two hydrogen atoms forming an angle of about 104.5 degrees with the oxygen atom. This asymmetrical shape, combined with the polar O-H bonds, results in an overall molecular polarity. The oxygen side of the molecule has a net negative charge, while the hydrogen side has a net positive charge. This polarity makes water a polar molecule, which contributes to its unique properties, such as its high boiling point, high heat capacity, and ability to dissolve many substances."
