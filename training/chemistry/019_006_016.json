    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction, we can use the expression:\n\nKc = [N2O4] / [NO2]^2\n\nwhere [N2O4] is the concentration of N2O4 at equilibrium, and [NO2] is the concentration of NO2 at equilibrium.\n\nGiven the concentrations of NO2 and N2O4 at equilibrium are 0.30 M and 0.20 M, respectively, we can plug these values into the expression:\n\nKc = (0.20) / (0.30)^2\n\nKc = 0.20 / 0.09\n\nKc ≈ 2.22\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction 2NO2(g) ⇌ N2O4(g) at 298K is approximately 2.22."
