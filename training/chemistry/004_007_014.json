    "message_2": "To find the mass percentage of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in the sample, we first need to determine the mass of CaCO3 that remains after heating. \n\nInitial mass of limestone = 1.50 grams\nFinal mass after heating = 2.33 grams\n\nSince heating drives off water and carbon dioxide, the mass difference is due to the loss of these components:\n\nMass of water and carbon dioxide lost = Initial mass - Final mass\n= 1.50 grams - 2.33 grams\n= -0.83 grams\n\nSince the mass difference is negative, it indicates that there is an error in the given data. The final mass after heating should be less than the initial mass. Please recheck the given data and provide the correct values."
