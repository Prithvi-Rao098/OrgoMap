    "message_2": "Nuclear reactions produce radiation that can be used to treat cancer cells through a process called radiotherapy or radiation therapy. In this treatment, high-energy particles or waves, such as X-rays, gamma rays, or charged particles, are used to target and destroy cancer cells. The main goal is to damage the DNA of cancer cells, which prevents them from dividing and growing, ultimately leading to cell death.\n\nTo minimize harm to healthy cells, several strategies are employed:\n\n1. Precise targeting: Advanced imaging techniques, such as computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) scans, are used to accurately locate the tumor and plan the radiation therapy. This allows for the precise delivery of radiation to the cancer cells while minimizing exposure to the surrounding healthy tissue.\n\n2. Fractionation: Instead of delivering a single, high dose of radiation, the total dose is divided into smaller doses called fractions. These fractions are typically given over several weeks, allowing healthy cells to repair the radiation-induced damage while cancer cells are less capable of repairing themselves.\n\n3. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT): This advanced technique uses computer-controlled linear accelerators to deliver radiation in varying intensities and shapes. By modulating the intensity of the radiation beams, IMRT can conform to the shape of the tumor, delivering a higher dose to cancer cells while sparing the surrounding healthy tissue.\n\n4. Proton therapy: Proton therapy is a type of particle therapy that uses protons, which are charged particles, to deliver radiation. Protons have a unique property called the Bragg peak, which allows them to deposit most of their energy at a specific depth within the body. This enables precise targeting of the tumor while minimizing damage to the surrounding healthy tissue.\n\n5. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT): These techniques involve delivering high doses of radiation to a small, well-defined target area in a single session or a few sessions. This allows for precise targeting of the tumor and reduces the exposure of healthy tissue to radiation.\n\n6. Radiosensitizers and radioprotectors: Radiosensitizers are drugs that make cancer cells more sensitive to radiation, while radioprotectors are drugs that protect healthy cells from radiation damage. These can be used in combination with radiation therapy to enhance the effectiveness of treatment and minimize harm to healthy cells.\n\nBy using these strategies and techniques, radiation therapy can effectively treat cancer cells while minimizing harm to healthy cells. However, it is important to note that some side effects and damage to healthy tissue may still occur, depending on the location and size of the tumor, the type of radiation used, and individual patient factors."
