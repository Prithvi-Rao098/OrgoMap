    "message_2": "To prepare 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid from benzoic acid and chlorine gas, the balanced equation for the reaction is:\n\nC6H5COOH + 2 Cl2 → C6H3Cl2COOH + 2 HCl\n\nNow, let's calculate the theoretical yield of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid:\n\n1. First, we need to find the molar mass of benzoic acid (C6H5COOH) and 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid (C6H3Cl2COOH).\n\nMolar mass of benzoic acid = (6 × 12.01) + (5 × 1.01) + 12.01 + (2 × 16.00) = 122.12 g/mol\nMolar mass of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid = (6 × 12.01) + (3 × 1.01) + (2 × 35.45) + 12.01 + (2 × 16.00) = 197.00 g/mol\n\n2. Next, we need to find the moles of benzoic acid used in the reaction.\n\nmoles of benzoic acid = mass / molar mass = 5 g / 122.12 g/mol = 0.0409 mol\n\n3. According to the balanced equation, 1 mole of benzoic acid reacts to produce 1 mole of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid. So, the moles of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid produced will be the same as the moles of benzoic acid used.\n\nmoles of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid = 0.0409 mol\n\n4. Finally, we can calculate the theoretical yield of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid.\n\ntheoretical yield = moles × molar mass = 0.0409 mol × 197.00 g/mol = 8.06 g\n\nSo, the theoretical yield of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid is 8.06 grams when 5 grams of benzoic acid are reacted with excess chlorine gas under standard conditions."
