    "message_2": "When a molecule interacts with an external electric field, its excited state can be affected in several ways. The electric field can cause changes in the energy levels, transition probabilities, and spectral properties of the excited state. To understand these effects, we can use quantum chemical calculations, which involve solving the Schrödinger equation for the molecule in the presence of the electric field.\n\n1. Effect on energy levels:\n\nThe interaction of the electric field with the molecule can be described by the Stark effect, which is the splitting or shifting of energy levels due to the presence of an external electric field. The Stark effect can be either linear or quadratic, depending on the strength of the electric field and the properties of the molecule.\n\nIn the linear Stark effect, the energy levels shift linearly with the strength of the electric field. This can be explained by the interaction of the electric field with the permanent electric dipole moment of the molecule. The energy shift can be calculated using the formula:\n\nΔE = -μ⋅E\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy shift, μ is the dipole moment of the molecule, and E is the strength of the electric field.\n\nIn the quadratic Stark effect, the energy levels shift quadratically with the strength of the electric field. This effect is due to the interaction of the electric field with the polarizability of the molecule. The energy shift can be calculated using the formula:\n\nΔE = -1/2 α⋅E^2\n\nwhere α is the polarizability of the molecule.\n\n2. Effect on transition probabilities:\n\nThe electric field can also affect the transition probabilities between different energy levels. The transition dipole moment, which determines the probability of a transition between two states, can be altered by the electric field. This can lead to changes in the absorption and emission spectra of the molecule.\n\n3. Effect on spectral properties:\n\nThe interaction of the electric field with the molecule can lead to changes in the spectral properties of the excited state, such as the absorption and emission wavelengths, linewidths, and intensities. These changes can be attributed to the shifts in energy levels and the modification of transition probabilities.\n\nTo study these effects using quantum chemical calculations, one can perform the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the electronic structure of the molecule in the absence of the electric field using methods such as Hartree-Fock, density functional theory (DFT), or post-Hartree-Fock methods (e.g., configuration interaction, coupled-cluster theory).\n\n2. Calculate the dipole moment and polarizability of the molecule using the obtained electronic structure.\n\n3. Introduce the external electric field and solve the Schrödinger equation for the molecule in the presence of the electric field. This can be done using perturbation theory or by directly solving the equation with the electric field included in the Hamiltonian.\n\n4. Analyze the changes in the energy levels, transition probabilities, and spectral properties of the excited state due to the interaction with the electric field.\n\nBy performing these calculations, one can gain a deeper understanding of the effects of an external electric field on the excited state of a molecule and predict the changes in its energy levels and spectral properties."
