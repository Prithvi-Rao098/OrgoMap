    "message_2": "Polonium-218 (Po-218) primarily undergoes alpha decay. In this decay mode, the nucleus emits an alpha particle, which consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. As a result, the atomic number decreases by 2, and the mass number decreases by 4.\n\nWhen Polonium-218 undergoes alpha decay, it forms Lead-214 (Pb-214) and an alpha particle (He-4). The equation for this decay process is:\n\nPo-218 â†’ Pb-214 + He-4"
