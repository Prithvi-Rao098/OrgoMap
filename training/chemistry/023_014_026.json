    "message_2": "To calculate the yield of 4-bromoacetanilide, we first need to determine the theoretical yield based on the stoichiometry of the reaction and then account for the 92% purity of the final product.\n\n1. Calculate the moles of acetanilide:\nThe molecular weight of acetanilide (C8H9NO) is:\n(12.01 * 8) + (1.01 * 9) + 14.01 + 16.00 = 135.17 g/mol\n\nMoles of acetanilide = mass / molecular weight\nMoles of acetanilide = 10 g / 135.17 g/mol = 0.0740 mol\n\n2. Determine the moles of 4-bromoacetanilide produced:\nSince the reaction has 100% conversion, the moles of 4-bromoacetanilide produced is equal to the moles of acetanilide used:\nMoles of 4-bromoacetanilide = 0.0740 mol\n\n3. Calculate the mass of the theoretical yield of 4-bromoacetanilide:\nThe molecular weight of 4-bromoacetanilide (C8H8BrNO) is:\n(12.01 * 8) + (1.01 * 8) + 79.90 + 14.01 + 16.00 = 214.07 g/mol\n\nMass of theoretical yield = moles * molecular weight\nMass of theoretical yield = 0.0740 mol * 214.07 g/mol = 15.84 g\n\n4. Calculate the actual yield based on the 92% purity of the final product:\nActual yield = theoretical yield * purity\nActual yield = 15.84 g * 0.92 = 14.57 g\n\nTherefore, the yield of 4-bromoacetanilide that can be obtained through the reaction is 14.57 grams."
