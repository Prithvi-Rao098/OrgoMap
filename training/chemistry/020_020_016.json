    "message_1": "Calculate the new equilibrium concentration of a complex ion formed between Cu<sup>2+</sup> and NH<sub>3</sub>(aq) at 25°C, if the initial concentration of Cu<sup>2+</sup> is 0.10 M and NH<sub>3</sub>(aq) is 0.05 M, and the temperature is increased to 35°C. The equilibrium constant (K<sub>c</sub>) for this reaction is 1.6×10<sup>7</sup>.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the new equilibrium concentration of the complex ion formed between Cu²⁺ and NH₃(aq), we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nCu²⁺(aq) + 4NH₃(aq) ⇌ Cu(NH₃)₄²⁺(aq)\n\nNext, we will set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the changes in the concentrations of the reactants and products as the reaction proceeds:\n\n|               | Cu²⁺(aq) | NH₃(aq) | Cu(NH₃)₄²⁺(aq) |\n|---------------|----------|---------|---------------|\n| Initial (M)   | 0.10     | 0.05    | 0             |\n| Change (M)    | -x       | -4x     | +x           |\n| Equilibrium(M)| 0.10-x   | 0.05-4x | x             |\n\nNow, we can write the expression for the equilibrium constant, Kc:\n\nKc = [Cu(NH₃)₄²⁺] / ([Cu²⁺][NH₃]^4)\n\nGiven that Kc = 1.6 × 10⁷ at 25°C, we can substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table into the Kc expression:\n\n1.6 × 10⁷ = (x) / ((0.10-x)(0.05-4x)^4)\n\nUnfortunately, we don't have enough information to determine the effect of the temperature change on the equilibrium constant. However, we can solve for x assuming the Kc value remains constant:\n\n1.6 × 10⁷ = (x) / ((0.10-x)(0.05-4x)^4)\n\nThis equation is a bit complex to solve algebraically, so we can use numerical methods or make an assumption that x is small compared to 0.10 and 0.05, which simplifies the equation:\n\n1.6 × 10⁷ ≈ (x) / ((0.10)(0.05)^4)\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx ≈ 1.6 × 10⁷ × (0.10)(0.05)^4\nx ≈ 1.25 × 10⁻³ M\n\nSo, the new equilibrium concentration of Cu(NH₃)₄²⁺ at 35°C, assuming the Kc value remains constant, is approximately 1.25 × 10⁻³ M. Keep in mind that this value is an approximation, and the actual equilibrium concentration may be different if the Kc value changes significantly with temperature."
