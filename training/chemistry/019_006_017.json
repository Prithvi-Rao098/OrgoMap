    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction, we can use the expression:\n\nKc = [N2] * [H2]^3 / [NH3]^2\n\nwhere [N2], [H2], and [NH3] represent the equilibrium concentrations of N2, H2, and NH3, respectively.\n\nGiven the equilibrium concentrations:\n[NH3] = 0.20 M\n[N2] = 0.025 M\n[H2] = 0.060 M\n\nPlug these values into the Kc expression:\n\nKc = (0.025) * (0.060)^3 / (0.20)^2\n\nKc = (0.025) * (0.000216) / (0.04)\n\nKc = 0.000135 / 0.04\n\nKc ≈ 3.375 × 10^-3\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction at 298 K is approximately 3.375 × 10^-3."
