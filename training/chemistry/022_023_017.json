    "message_2": "To calculate the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid, we can use the formula for the ionization constant (Ka) of a weak acid:\n\nKa = [H+][A-] / [HA]\n\nWhere [H+] is the concentration of hydrogen ions, [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate ions), and [HA] is the concentration of the undissociated acetic acid.\n\nSince the initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.1 M, we can assume that the change in concentration due to ionization is small. Let x be the concentration of hydrogen ions and acetate ions after ionization:\n\nKa = (x)(x) / (0.1 - x)\n\nGiven that Ka = 1.8 x 10^-5, we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 = x^2 / (0.1 - x)\n\nSince x is small compared to 0.1, we can approximate the equation as:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 ≈ x^2 / 0.1\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx^2 ≈ 1.8 x 10^-5 * 0.1\nx^2 ≈ 1.8 x 10^-6\nx ≈ √(1.8 x 10^-6)\nx ≈ 1.34 x 10^-3\n\nNow that we have the concentration of hydrogen ions [H+], we can calculate the pH using the formula:\n\npH = -log[H+]\n\npH = -log(1.34 x 10^-3)\npH ≈ 2.87\n\nTherefore, the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid is approximately 2.87."
