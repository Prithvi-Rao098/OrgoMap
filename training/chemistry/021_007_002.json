    "message_2": "To calculate the formal charge of the sulfur atom in SO₂, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the number of valence electrons for sulfur. Sulfur is in group 16, so it has 6 valence electrons.\n2. Calculate the number of non-bonding electrons on the sulfur atom. In SO₂, sulfur forms two double bonds with two oxygen atoms, so it has no non-bonding electrons.\n3. Calculate the number of bonding electrons. Since there are two double bonds, there are 4 bonding electron pairs (each double bond has 2 electron pairs), which means there are 8 bonding electrons in total.\n4. Divide the number of bonding electrons by 2 to get the number of electron pairs. In this case, 8 bonding electrons divided by 2 equals 4 electron pairs.\n5. Subtract the number of non-bonding electrons and electron pairs from the number of valence electrons: 6 (valence electrons) - 0 (non-bonding electrons) - 4 (electron pairs) = 2.\n\nThe formal charge of the sulfur atom in SO₂ is +2."
