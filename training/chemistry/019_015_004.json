    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the fusion of 50 grams of ice at -10°C to liquid water at 10°C, we need to consider three steps:\n\n1. Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C.\n2. Melting the ice at 0°C.\n3. Heating the liquid water from 0°C to 10°C.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the moles of ice:\nThe molar mass of water (H2O) is 18.015 g/mol.\nmoles = (mass) / (molar mass) = 50 g / 18.015 g/mol = 2.776 moles\n\nStep 1: Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C\nThe specific heat capacity of ice is approximately 2.093 J/g°C.\nq1 = (mass) × (specific heat capacity of ice) × (change in temperature)\nq1 = 50 g × 2.093 J/g°C × (0 - (-10))°C = 50 g × 2.093 J/g°C × 10°C = 1046.5 J\n\nStep 2: Melting the ice at 0°C\nq2 = (moles) × (enthalpy of fusion)\nq2 = 2.776 moles × 6.01 kJ/mol = 16.681 kJ = 16681 J\n\nStep 3: Heating the liquid water from 0°C to 10°C\nq3 = (mass) × (specific heat capacity of water) × (change in temperature)\nq3 = 50 g × 4.184 J/g°C × (10 - 0)°C = 50 g × 4.184 J/g°C × 10°C = 2092 J\n\nNow, let's sum up the enthalpy changes for all three steps:\nΔH = q1 + q2 + q3 = 1046.5 J + 16681 J + 2092 J = 19819.5 J\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the fusion of 50 grams of ice at -10°C to liquid water at 10°C is 19.82 kJ (rounded to two decimal places)."
