    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of energy required to vaporize 50 grams of water at its boiling point, we need to first determine the number of moles of water and then use the enthalpy of vaporization to find the energy.\n\n1. Calculate the number of moles of water:\nThe molar mass of water (H2O) is 18.015 g/mol. \n\nmoles of water = mass of water / molar mass of water\nmoles of water = 50 g / 18.015 g/mol\nmoles of water ≈ 2.775 moles\n\n2. Calculate the energy required using the enthalpy of vaporization:\nEnergy = moles of water × enthalpy of vaporization\n\nEnergy = 2.775 moles × 40.7 kJ/mol\nEnergy ≈ 112.94 kJ\n\nTherefore, the amount of energy required to vaporize 50 grams of water at its boiling point is approximately 112.94 kJ."
