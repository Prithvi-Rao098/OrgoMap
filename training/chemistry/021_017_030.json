    "message_2": "In a sample of water, the primary type of intermolecular forces present are hydrogen bonds. These are strong dipole-dipole interactions that occur between the partially positive hydrogen atom of one water molecule and the partially negative oxygen atom of another water molecule. Additionally, there are also weaker London dispersion forces (also known as van der Waals forces) present between the water molecules."
