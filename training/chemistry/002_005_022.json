    "message_2": "To distinguish between ionic, covalent, and metallic compounds, we can examine their physical properties and chemical behaviors. Here are the key differences among the three types of compounds:\n\n1. Ionic Compounds:\n- Physical properties: Ionic compounds have high melting and boiling points, are generally crystalline solids at room temperature, and are soluble in polar solvents like water.\n- Chemical behaviors: They conduct electricity when dissolved in water or in a molten state due to the presence of mobile ions. They also tend to form salts and are composed of positively charged cations and negatively charged anions.\n- Example: Sodium chloride (NaCl) is an ionic compound. It has a high melting point (801°C) and boiling point (1413°C), is soluble in water, and conducts electricity when dissolved or molten.\n\n2. Covalent Compounds:\n- Physical properties: Covalent compounds have lower melting and boiling points compared to ionic compounds, and can be found in solid, liquid, or gaseous states at room temperature. They are generally insoluble or have low solubility in polar solvents like water but are soluble in nonpolar solvents.\n- Chemical behaviors: They do not conduct electricity in any state, as they do not have mobile ions. Covalent compounds are formed by sharing electrons between non-metal atoms, creating strong covalent bonds within the molecule but weaker intermolecular forces between molecules.\n- Example: Water (H2O) is a covalent compound. It has a relatively low melting point (0°C) and boiling point (100°C), is a liquid at room temperature, and does not conduct electricity.\n\n3. Metallic Compounds:\n- Physical properties: Metallic compounds have high melting and boiling points, are generally solid at room temperature (except for mercury), and are malleable and ductile. They have a characteristic metallic luster and are good conductors of heat and electricity.\n- Chemical behaviors: They conduct electricity in solid and molten states due to the presence of mobile electrons (delocalized electrons) in the metallic lattice. Metallic compounds are formed by the electrostatic attraction between positively charged metal cations and a \"sea\" of delocalized electrons.\n- Example: Copper (Cu) is a metallic compound. It has a high melting point (1085°C) and boiling point (2562°C), is a solid at room temperature, and is an excellent conductor of heat and electricity.\n\nIn summary, to distinguish between ionic, covalent, and metallic compounds, observe their physical properties such as melting and boiling points, solubility, and electrical conductivity, as well as their chemical behaviors. Ionic compounds typically have high melting and boiling points, are soluble in polar solvents, and conduct electricity when dissolved or molten. Covalent compounds have lower melting and boiling points, are insoluble or have low solubility in polar solvents, and do not conduct electricity. Metallic compounds have high melting and boiling points, are malleable and ductile, and are good conductors of heat and electricity."
