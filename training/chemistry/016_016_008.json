Assume all reactants and products are in their standard states.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the following formula:\n\nΔH° = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH° is the standard enthalpy change for the reaction, and ΔHf° represents the standard enthalpy change of formation for each compound.\n\nFor the products:\n2 mol Fe(s): 2 * 0 kJ/mol = 0 kJ\n3 mol CO2(g): 3 * (-393.5 kJ/mol) = -1180.5 kJ\n\nFor the reactants:\n1 mol Fe2O3(s): 1 * (-824.2 kJ/mol) = -824.2 kJ\n3 mol CO(g): Since the standard enthalpy of formation for CO(g) is not given, we will assume it to be 0 kJ/mol. Therefore, 3 * 0 kJ/mol = 0 kJ.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nΔH° = (0 kJ + (-1180.5 kJ)) - ((-824.2 kJ) + 0 kJ)\nΔH° = -1180.5 kJ + 824.2 kJ\nΔH° = -356.3 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the reduction of iron(III) oxide to iron is -356.3 kJ."
