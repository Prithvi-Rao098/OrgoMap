    "message_2": "To calculate the nuclear binding energy of a helium-4 atom, we need to determine the mass defect and then convert it to energy using Einstein's famous equation, E=mc^2.\n\nA helium-4 atom consists of 2 protons, 2 neutrons, and 2 electrons. We will only consider the nucleus, which contains the protons and neutrons.\n\nMass of a proton = 1.007276466812 amu\nMass of a neutron = 1.008664915 amu\n\nMass of 2 protons = 2 * 1.007276466812 amu = 2.014552933624 amu\nMass of 2 neutrons = 2 * 1.008664915 amu = 2.01732983 amu\n\nTotal mass of the nucleus (protons and neutrons) = 2.014552933624 amu + 2.01732983 amu = 4.031882763624 amu\n\nThe actual mass of a helium-4 nucleus (also known as an alpha particle) is 4.001506179127 amu.\n\nMass defect = Total mass of the nucleus - Actual mass of helium-4 nucleus\nMass defect = 4.031882763624 amu - 4.001506179127 amu = 0.030376584497 amu\n\nTo convert the mass defect to energy, we need to convert amu to kg and use the speed of light (c) in the equation E=mc^2.\n\n1 amu = 1.66053906660 × 10^-27 kg\n\nMass defect in kg = 0.030376584497 amu * 1.66053906660 × 10^-27 kg/amu = 5.045049543 × 10^-29 kg\n\nSpeed of light (c) = 2.99792458 × 10^8 m/s\n\nNuclear binding energy (E) = mc^2\nE = (5.045049543 × 10^-29 kg) * (2.99792458 × 10^8 m/s)^2\nE = 4.533431 × 10^-12 Joules\n\nTo convert the energy to more common units, such as MeV (Mega-electron volts), we can use the following conversion:\n\n1 Joule = 6.242 × 10^12 MeV\n\nNuclear binding energy (E) = 4.533431 × 10^-12 Joules * 6.242 × 10^12 MeV/Joule\nE ≈ 28.3 MeV\n\nSo, the nuclear binding energy of a helium-4 atom is approximately 28.3 MeV."
