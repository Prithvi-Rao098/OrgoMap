    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change when calcium chloride dihydrate (CaCl2•2H2O) is heated to release its water of hydration, we need to consider the enthalpy change of the reaction:\n\nCaCl2•2H2O (s) → CaCl2 (s) + 2H2O (g)\n\nFirst, we need to find the enthalpy of formation of CaCl2•2H2O. We know the enthalpy of formation of CaCl2 is -795.8 kJ/mol. The enthalpy of formation of water (H2O) is -285.8 kJ/mol. Therefore, the enthalpy of formation of CaCl2•2H2O can be calculated as follows:\n\nΔHf (CaCl2•2H2O) = ΔHf (CaCl2) + 2 * ΔHf (H2O)\nΔHf (CaCl2•2H2O) = -795.8 kJ/mol + 2 * (-285.8 kJ/mol)\nΔHf (CaCl2•2H2O) = -1367.4 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we need to find the enthalpy change of the reaction (ΔHrxn). To do this, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔHrxn = ΔHf (products) - ΔHf (reactants)\n\nIn this case, the products are CaCl2 and 2H2O, and the reactant is CaCl2•2H2O. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nΔHrxn = (ΔHf (CaCl2) + 2 * ΔHf (H2O)) - ΔHf (CaCl2•2H2O)\nΔHrxn = (-795.8 kJ/mol + 2 * (-285.8 kJ/mol)) - (-1367.4 kJ/mol)\nΔHrxn = 44 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the enthalpy change when calcium chloride dihydrate is heated to release its water of hydration is approximately 44 kJ/mol."
