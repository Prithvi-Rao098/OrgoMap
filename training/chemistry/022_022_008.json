    "message_2": "Le Chatelier's principle states that if a dynamic equilibrium is disturbed by changing the conditions, the position of equilibrium will shift to counteract the change.\n\nIn the case of a reaction that produces gas, increasing the temperature will affect the equilibrium position depending on whether the reaction is exothermic (releases heat) or endothermic (absorbs heat).\n\n1. If the reaction is exothermic (heat is a product):\n\nIncreasing the temperature will add heat to the system, and according to Le Chatelier's principle, the equilibrium will shift to counteract this change. In this case, the equilibrium will shift towards the reactants (the reverse reaction) to consume the added heat. As a result, the production of gas will decrease, and the concentration of reactants will increase.\n\n2. If the reaction is endothermic (heat is a reactant):\n\nIn this case, increasing the temperature will also add heat to the system. However, since heat is a reactant in an endothermic reaction, the equilibrium will shift towards the products (the forward reaction) to consume the added heat. This will result in an increase in the production of gas and a decrease in the concentration of reactants.\n\nIn summary, the effect of increasing temperature on the equilibrium position of a reaction that produces gas depends on the nature of the reaction (exothermic or endothermic). For exothermic reactions, the equilibrium will shift towards the reactants, decreasing gas production. For endothermic reactions, the equilibrium will shift towards the products, increasing gas production."
