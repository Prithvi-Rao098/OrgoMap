    "message_2": "To find the empirical formula of a compound, we need to determine the mole ratio of the elements present in the compound. First, we need to convert the given mass of each element to moles.\n\n1. Calculate the moles of each element:\nMoles of calcium (Ca) = mass / molar mass\nMoles of Ca = 0.92 g / (40.08 g/mol) = 0.02295 mol\n\nMoles of fluorine (F) = mass / molar mass\nMoles of F = 0.73 g / (19.00 g/mol) = 0.03842 mol\n\nMoles of oxygen (O) = mass / molar mass\nMoles of O = 0.35 g / (16.00 g/mol) = 0.02188 mol\n\n2. Determine the mole ratio:\nDivide the moles of each element by the smallest number of moles to get the mole ratio.\n\nMole ratio of Ca = 0.02295 / 0.02188 = 1.05 ≈ 1\nMole ratio of F = 0.03842 / 0.02188 = 1.75 ≈ 2\nMole ratio of O = 0.02188 / 0.02188 = 1\n\n3. Write the empirical formula:\nThe empirical formula is the simplest whole number ratio of the elements in the compound. Based on the mole ratios calculated above, the empirical formula is:\n\nCa₁F₂O₁ or CaFO₂"
