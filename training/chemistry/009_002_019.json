    "message_2": "The decay of Thorium-232 to Lead-208 involves a series of five alpha and four beta decays. \n\nAn alpha particle consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, while a beta particle is an electron (or positron) emitted during the decay process.\n\nSince there are five alpha decays, the total number of alpha particles emitted is 5.\n\nFor the four beta decays, the total number of beta particles emitted is 4.\n\nTherefore, the total number of α and β particles emitted during the decay of Thorium-232 to Lead-208 is 5 + 4 = 9 particles."
