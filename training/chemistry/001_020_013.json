    "message_2": "When propene reacts with HBr in the presence of peroxide, the product formed is 1-bromopropane. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nC3H6 + HBr → C3H7Br\n\nThe mechanism involved in this reaction is called free radical addition, which follows the anti-Markovnikov rule. The presence of peroxide initiates the formation of free radicals. The reaction proceeds through the following steps:\n\n1. Initiation: Peroxide (ROOR) decomposes into two alkoxy radicals (RO•) due to the weak O-O bond. The alkoxy radical reacts with HBr, generating a bromine radical (Br•) and an alcohol (ROH).\n\nROOR → 2 RO•\nRO• + HBr → ROH + Br•\n\n2. Propagation: The bromine radical (Br•) reacts with propene (C3H6), forming a primary radical at the less substituted carbon (anti-Markovnikov rule).\n\nBr• + C3H6 → •CH2-CH(CH3)\n\nThe primary radical reacts with another HBr molecule, forming 1-bromopropane (C3H7Br) and regenerating the bromine radical (Br•).\n\n•CH2-CH(CH3) + HBr → C3H7Br + Br•\n\n3. Termination: Two radicals combine to form a stable molecule, ending the chain reaction. This step is not specific and can involve any radicals present in the reaction mixture.\n\nBr• + Br• → Br2\nBr• + RO• → ROBr\nRO• + RO• → ROOR\n\nThe overall reaction results in the formation of 1-bromopropane as the major product, following the anti-Markovnikov rule due to the free radical mechanism in the presence of peroxide."
