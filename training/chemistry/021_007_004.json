    "message_2": "To calculate the formal charge on each atom in the molecule CO3^2-, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the number of valence electrons for each atom.\n2. Calculate the number of non-bonding (lone pair) electrons for each atom.\n3. Calculate the number of bonding electrons for each atom.\n4. Calculate the formal charge for each atom using the formula: Formal charge = Valence electrons - (Non-bonding electrons + 1/2 Bonding electrons)\n\nCO3^2- is a carbonate ion, which has a resonance structure. The molecule consists of one carbon atom and three oxygen atoms, with one of the oxygen atoms having a double bond with the carbon atom, and the other two oxygen atoms having single bonds with the carbon atom. The molecule has a -2 charge.\n\nStep 1: Valence electrons\n- Carbon (C): 4 valence electrons\n- Oxygen (O): 6 valence electrons\n\nStep 2: Non-bonding (lone pair) electrons\n- Carbon (C): 0 lone pair electrons (all electrons are involved in bonding)\n- Oxygen with a double bond (O): 4 lone pair electrons (2 lone pairs)\n- Oxygen with a single bond (O): 6 lone pair electrons (3 lone pairs)\n\nStep 3: Bonding electrons\n- Carbon (C): 4 bonding electrons (1 double bond and 2 single bonds)\n- Oxygen with a double bond (O): 4 bonding electrons (1 double bond)\n- Oxygen with a single bond (O): 2 bonding electrons (1 single bond)\n\nStep 4: Calculate the formal charge for each atom\n- Carbon (C): 4 - (0 + 1/2 * 4) = 4 - 2 = 0\n- Oxygen with a double bond (O): 6 - (4 + 1/2 * 4) = 6 - 6 = 0\n- Oxygen with a single bond (O): 6 - (6 + 1/2 * 2) = 6 - 7 = -1\n\nThe formal charges for the atoms in the CO3^2- molecule are:\n- Carbon (C): 0\n- Oxygen with a double bond (O): 0\n- Oxygen with a single bond (O): -1 (for each of the two oxygen atoms)\n\nSince there are two oxygen atoms with a single bond and a -1 charge, the overall charge of the molecule is -2, which matches the given charge of CO3^2-."
