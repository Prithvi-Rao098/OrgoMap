    "message_2": "The reaction between an alkene and water in the presence of a sulfuric acid catalyst to form an alcohol is known as an acid-catalyzed hydration reaction. The reaction mechanism involves three main steps and proceeds through a carbocation intermediate species.\n\n1. Protonation of the alkene: In the first step, the alkene reacts with the sulfuric acid (H2SO4) to form a protonated alkene. The alkene acts as a nucleophile and attacks the proton (H+) from the sulfuric acid, resulting in the formation of a carbocation intermediate. This step is reversible.\n\n2. Nucleophilic attack by water: In the second step, the carbocation intermediate formed in the first step is attacked by a water molecule, which acts as a nucleophile. The oxygen atom in the water molecule donates a pair of electrons to the carbocation, forming a bond with the carbon atom. This results in the formation of an oxonium ion intermediate.\n\n3. Deprotonation: In the final step, the oxonium ion intermediate loses a proton (H+) to another water molecule or a bisulfate ion (HSO4-) from the sulfuric acid, resulting in the formation of the alcohol product and regenerating the acid catalyst.\n\nOverall, the reaction mechanism involves the formation of a carbocation intermediate and an oxonium ion intermediate, with the sulfuric acid catalyst playing a crucial role in the protonation and deprotonation steps."
