    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change when 50 grams of potassium chloride (KCl) dissolve in 200 ml of water, we need to determine the number of moles of KCl and then use the molar enthalpy of dissolution.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of moles of KCl:\n\nMolar mass of KCl = 39.1 g/mol (for K) + 35.5 g/mol (for Cl) = 74.6 g/mol\n\nNumber of moles = mass / molar mass\nNumber of moles = 50 g / 74.6 g/mol = 0.670 moles\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change using the molar enthalpy of dissolution:\n\nEnthalpy change = number of moles × molar enthalpy of dissolution\nEnthalpy change = 0.670 moles × (-17.8 kJ/mol)\nEnthalpy change = -11.93 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change when 50 grams of potassium chloride dissolve in 200 ml of water at a temperature of 25°C is approximately -11.93 kJ."
