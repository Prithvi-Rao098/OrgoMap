    "message_2": "The Langmuir adsorption isotherm is given by the equation:\n\nθ = (KP) / (1 + KP)\n\nwhere θ is the fractional surface coverage, K is the Langmuir constant (0.25 L/mol in this case), and P is the pressure (1 atm).\n\nTo find the maximum surface coverage of nitrogen gas on the platinum surface, we can plug in the given values into the equation:\n\nθ = (0.25 L/mol * 1 atm) / (1 + 0.25 L/mol * 1 atm)\n\nθ = (0.25) / (1 + 0.25)\n\nθ = 0.25 / 1.25\n\nθ ≈ 0.20\n\nThe maximum surface coverage of nitrogen gas on the platinum surface at 25°C and a pressure of 1 atm, according to the Langmuir adsorption isotherm data with a Langmuir constant of 0.25 L/mole, is approximately 0.20 or 20%."
