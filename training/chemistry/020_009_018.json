    "message_1": "What is the equilibrium constant (Kc) at 25°C for the following gas-phase reaction:\n2NO2(g) ⇄ 2NO(g) + O2(g)\nGiven the concentrations at equilibrium: [NO2] = 0.050 M, [NO] = 0.035 M and [O2] = 0.020 M.",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction, we can use the expression:\n\nKc = [products]^coefficients / [reactants]^coefficients\n\nFor the given reaction, the expression for Kc is:\n\nKc = ([NO]^2 * [O2]) / [NO2]^2\n\nNow, we can plug in the given equilibrium concentrations:\n\nKc = ((0.035)^2 * (0.020)) / (0.050)^2\n\nKc = (0.001225 * 0.020) / 0.0025\n\nKc = 0.000245 / 0.0025\n\nKc ≈ 0.098\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction at 25°C is approximately 0.098."
