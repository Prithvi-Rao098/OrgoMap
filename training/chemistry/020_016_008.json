    "message_1": "What is the change in solubility of silver chloride (AgCl) when the concentration of sodium chloride (NaCl) in a solution is increased from 0.1 M to 0.5 M at 25°C, given that the solubility product constant (Ksp) of AgCl is 1.8 x 10^-10 ?",
    "message_2": "To determine the change in solubility of AgCl when the concentration of NaCl is increased, we need to consider the common ion effect. The common ion effect states that the solubility of a sparingly soluble salt is decreased in the presence of a common ion.\n\nFirst, let's write the solubility equilibrium expression for AgCl:\n\nAgCl (s) ⇌ Ag⁺ (aq) + Cl⁻ (aq)\n\nThe Ksp expression for AgCl is:\n\nKsp = [Ag⁺][Cl⁻] = 1.8 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\nNow, let's consider the initial and final concentrations of NaCl:\n\nInitial concentration of NaCl = 0.1 M\nFinal concentration of NaCl = 0.5 M\n\nSince NaCl is a strong electrolyte, it dissociates completely in water:\n\nNaCl (aq) → Na⁺ (aq) + Cl⁻ (aq)\n\nThe initial concentration of Cl⁻ ions from NaCl is 0.1 M, and the final concentration is 0.5 M.\n\nNow, let's find the solubility of AgCl in both cases:\n\nCase 1: Initial concentration of Cl⁻ ions = 0.1 M\n\nKsp = [Ag⁺][Cl⁻] = [Ag⁺](0.1 + x)\n1.8 x 10⁻¹⁰ = [Ag⁺](0.1 + x)\n\nAssuming x is very small compared to 0.1, we can approximate:\n\n1.8 x 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ [Ag⁺](0.1)\n[Ag⁺] ≈ 1.8 x 10⁻⁹ M\n\nCase 2: Final concentration of Cl⁻ ions = 0.5 M\n\nKsp = [Ag⁺][Cl⁻] = [Ag⁺](0.5 + x)\n1.8 x 10⁻¹⁰ = [Ag⁺](0.5 + x)\n\nAgain, assuming x is very small compared to 0.5, we can approximate:\n\n1.8 x 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ [Ag⁺](0.5)\n[Ag⁺] ≈ 3.6 x 10⁻¹⁰ M\n\nNow, let's find the change in solubility:\n\nChange in solubility = Final solubility - Initial solubility\nChange in solubility = (3.6 x 10⁻¹⁰ M) - (1.8 x 10⁻⁹ M)\nChange in solubility = -1.44 x 10⁻⁹ M\n\nThe solubility of AgCl decreases by 1.44 x 10⁻⁹ M when the concentration of NaCl is increased from 0.1 M to 0.5 M at 25°C."
