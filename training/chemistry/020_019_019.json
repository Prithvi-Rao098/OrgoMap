    "message_2": "The pH of a solution can significantly affect the formation of a complex ion by influencing the availability of the ligands and the stability of the complex ion formed. In the case of the coordination reaction between a copper (II) ion and ammonia, the pH plays a crucial role in determining the extent of complex formation.\n\nCopper (II) ions (Cu²⁺) can form a complex ion with ammonia (NH₃) as a ligand. The coordination reaction can be represented as follows:\n\nCu²⁺(aq) + 4NH₃(aq) ⇌ [Cu(NH₃)₄]²⁺(aq)\n\nIn this reaction, the copper (II) ion forms a complex ion with four ammonia molecules, resulting in the formation of the tetraamminecopper(II) complex ion, [Cu(NH₃)₄]²⁺.\n\nThe pH of the solution affects the availability of ammonia molecules to act as ligands. At low pH (acidic conditions), the ammonia molecules can react with the excess H⁺ ions present in the solution, forming ammonium ions (NH₄⁺):\n\nNH₃(aq) + H⁺(aq) ⇌ NH₄⁺(aq)\n\nThe formation of ammonium ions reduces the concentration of free ammonia molecules available to form the complex ion with copper (II) ions. As a result, the equilibrium of the coordination reaction shifts to the left, and the formation of the [Cu(NH₃)₄]²⁺ complex ion is less favored.\n\nOn the other hand, at high pH (alkaline conditions), the concentration of H⁺ ions is low, and the ammonia molecules remain mostly unprotonated. This increases the availability of free ammonia molecules to act as ligands, favoring the formation of the [Cu(NH₃)₄]²⁺ complex ion.\n\nIn summary, the pH of a solution can significantly affect the formation of a complex ion by influencing the availability of ligands and the stability of the complex ion. In the case of the coordination reaction between a copper (II) ion and ammonia, higher pH (alkaline conditions) favors the formation of the [Cu(NH₃)₄]²⁺ complex ion, while lower pH (acidic conditions) reduces the extent of complex formation."
