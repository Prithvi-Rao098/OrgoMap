    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the electrochemical reaction, we first need to determine the overall cell potential (E_cell) for the reaction. The cell potential can be calculated using the standard reduction potentials of the two half-reactions involved.\n\nThe overall reaction can be written as:\n\nZn(s) + 2H+(aq) → Zn2+(aq) + H2(g)\n\nThe half-reactions are:\n\n1. Oxidation of Zn: Zn(s) → Zn2+(aq) + 2e- (E° = -0.76 V)\n2. Reduction of H+: 2H+(aq) + 2e- → H2(g) (E° = 0 V)\n\nNow, we can calculate the overall cell potential (E_cell) by subtracting the standard reduction potential of the oxidation half-reaction from the standard reduction potential of the reduction half-reaction:\n\nE_cell = E°(reduction) - E°(oxidation)\nE_cell = 0 V - (-0.76 V)\nE_cell = 0.76 V\n\nNow that we have the cell potential, we can calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) using the following equation:\n\nΔG = -nFE_cell\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the reaction (in this case, n = 2), F is the Faraday constant (approximately 96,485 C/mol), and E_cell is the cell potential.\n\nΔG = -(2 mol)(96,485 C/mol)(0.76 V)\nΔG = -146,327.6 J/mol\n\nSince we usually express Gibbs free energy change in kJ/mol, we can convert the value:\n\nΔG = -146.33 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the Gibbs free energy change for the electrochemical reaction where zinc metal is oxidized by aqueous hydrogen ions to form aqueous zinc ions and hydrogen gas at 298 K is -146.33 kJ/mol."
