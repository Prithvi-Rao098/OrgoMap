    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question:\n\nA student wishes to deposit 0.1 g of copper metal by electrolysis of a solution containing Cu²⁺ ions. The student measures the current used during the process to be 0.5 A. How long (in hours) must the process occur in order to deposit the desired amount of copper metal, assuming 100% current efficiency?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use Faraday's Law of Electrolysis. First, we need to find the number of moles of copper that the student wants to deposit.\n\nCopper has a molar mass of 63.5 g/mol. So, 0.1 g of copper is:\n\n0.1 g / 63.5 g/mol = 0.00157 mol of copper\n\nSince the copper ions have a charge of +2 (Cu²⁺), the number of moles of electrons needed to deposit 0.1 g of copper is:\n\n0.00157 mol Cu * 2 mol e⁻/mol Cu = 0.00314 mol e⁻\n\nNow, we need to convert the moles of electrons to coulombs using Faraday's constant (1 mol e⁻ = 96,485 C):\n\n0.00314 mol e⁻ * 96,485 C/mol e⁻ = 303.04 C\n\nNext, we can use the current (0.5 A) to find the time needed for the electrolysis process:\n\ntime = charge / current\n\ntime = 303.04 C / 0.5 A = 606.08 s\n\nFinally, we can convert the time to hours:\n\n606.08 s * (1 min / 60 s) * (1 hour / 60 min) = 0.1689 hours\n\nSo, the student must perform the electrolysis process for approximately 0.169 hours (or about 10.1 minutes) to deposit 0.1 g of copper metal, assuming 100% current efficiency."
