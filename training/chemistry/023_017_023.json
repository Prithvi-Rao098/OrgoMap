    "message_2": "The optimal ratio of diisocyanate to polyol for synthesizing polyurethane with the desired mechanical properties depends on the specific application and requirements of the final product. In general, the stoichiometric ratio of diisocyanate to polyol is 1:1, meaning one isocyanate group reacts with one hydroxyl group. However, this ratio can be adjusted to achieve specific properties in the final polyurethane product.\n\nFor example, if a more flexible and softer polyurethane is desired, a higher ratio of polyol to diisocyanate can be used. Conversely, if a more rigid and harder polyurethane is desired, a higher ratio of diisocyanate to polyol can be used.\n\nIt is essential to consider other factors, such as the molecular weight of the polyol, the functionality of the diisocyanate, and the presence of any additives or catalysts, as these can also influence the mechanical properties of the final polyurethane product.\n\nIn practice, it is common to perform a series of experiments with varying ratios of diisocyanate to polyol to determine the optimal ratio for the desired mechanical properties."
