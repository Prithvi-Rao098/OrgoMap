    "message_2": "The addition of various substituents to a chemical compound can significantly affect its electronic transport properties. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations can be used to predict these changes by providing insights into the electronic structure and properties of the modified compounds.\n\nElectronic transport properties are mainly governed by the energy levels and spatial distribution of the molecular orbitals, particularly the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). The addition of substituents can alter the energy levels and spatial distribution of these orbitals, which in turn affects the electronic transport properties of the compound.\n\nTo compare and contrast the electronic transport properties of the original compound with the modified compounds, the following computational tools and methodologies can be employed:\n\n1. Geometry optimization: Perform geometry optimization of the original and modified compounds using DFT calculations to obtain the most stable molecular structures. This will provide a basis for further analysis of the electronic properties.\n\n2. Calculation of HOMO and LUMO energies: Calculate the HOMO and LUMO energies for the optimized structures using DFT. The energy difference between the HOMO and LUMO (known as the HOMO-LUMO gap) is an important parameter that influences the electronic transport properties. A smaller HOMO-LUMO gap generally results in better electronic transport properties.\n\n3. Analysis of molecular orbitals: Visualize the spatial distribution of the HOMO and LUMO orbitals for the original and modified compounds. The addition of substituents can cause changes in the shape and distribution of these orbitals, which can affect the electronic transport properties.\n\n4. Calculation of electronic coupling: Electronic coupling between molecules is another important factor that influences electronic transport properties. Calculate the electronic coupling between the original and modified compounds using DFT-based methods, such as the fragment orbital density functional theory (FODFT) approach.\n\n5. Evaluation of charge transfer properties: Investigate the charge transfer properties of the original and modified compounds using DFT calculations. The addition of substituents can affect the charge transfer properties, which in turn can influence the electronic transport properties.\n\nBy comparing the HOMO-LUMO gap, molecular orbital distributions, electronic coupling, and charge transfer properties of the original and modified compounds, one can gain insights into how the addition of various substituents affects the electronic transport properties of the chemical compound. This information can be useful for designing new materials with tailored electronic properties for applications in electronics, optoelectronics, and energy storage devices."
