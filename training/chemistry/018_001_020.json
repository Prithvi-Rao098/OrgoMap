    "message_2": "Given that the reaction is first-order with respect to NO and H2, the rate law can be written as:\n\nrate = k[NO]^m[H2]^n\n\nwhere k is the rate constant, m is the order with respect to NO, and n is the order with respect to H2.\n\nFrom the experimental data, we can set up the following equations:\n\n1) 2.50 x 10^-6 = k(0.01)^m(0.01)^n\n2) 5.00 x 10^-6 = k(0.02)^m(0.01)^n\n3) 5.00 x 10^-6 = k(0.01)^m(0.02)^n\n\nWe are given that the reaction is first-order with respect to both NO and H2, so m = 1 and n = 1. Plugging these values into the equations, we get:\n\n1) 2.50 x 10^-6 = k(0.01)(0.01)\n2) 5.00 x 10^-6 = k(0.02)(0.01)\n3) 5.00 x 10^-6 = k(0.01)(0.02)\n\nNow, we can solve for the rate constant k:\n\nFrom equation 1: k = 2.50 x 10^-6 / (0.01 * 0.01) = 25\n\nNow that we have the rate constant k, we can write the rate law:\n\nrate = 25[NO][H2]"
