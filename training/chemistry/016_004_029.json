    "message_2": "To calculate the specific heat capacity (c) of a substance, we can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the energy required (in joules), m is the mass of the sample (in grams), c is the specific heat capacity (in J/g°C), and ΔT is the change in temperature (in °C).\n\nIn this case, we are given:\n\nq = 2510 J\nm = 50 g\nΔT = 10 °C\n\nWe need to find the specific heat capacity (c). Rearranging the formula to solve for c, we get:\n\nc = q / (mΔT)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nc = 2510 J / (50 g × 10 °C)\nc = 2510 J / 500 g°C\nc = 5.02 J/g°C\n\nThe specific heat capacity of the substance is 5.02 J/g°C."
