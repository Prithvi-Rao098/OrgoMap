    "message_2": "The efficiency of a Geiger-Muller counter in measuring radiation emitted by a sample of Uranium-235 depends on various factors such as the type of radiation, the geometry of the counter, and the distance between the sample and the counter. \n\nUranium-235 primarily emits alpha particles, which have a short range and are easily absorbed by the air or other materials. Geiger-Muller counters are generally more efficient at detecting beta particles and gamma rays than alpha particles. The efficiency for detecting alpha particles can be as low as 1-5%, while for beta particles and gamma rays, it can range from 30-80%.\n\nTo improve the efficiency of a Geiger-Muller counter for detecting alpha particles from Uranium-235, the sample should be placed as close as possible to the detector, and the detector should have a thin window to allow the alpha particles to enter. However, even with these modifications, the efficiency may still be relatively low compared to other types of radiation detectors, such as solid-state detectors or scintillation counters, which are more suitable for detecting alpha particles."
