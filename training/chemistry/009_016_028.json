    "message_2": "The gamma spectrum of the sample shows three main peaks at energies of 511 keV, 662 keV, and 1173 keV. These energies correspond to specific gamma-ray emissions from radioactive isotopes.\n\nThe 511 keV peak is a common energy associated with the annihilation of an electron and a positron, which is a characteristic of positron emission or β+ decay.\n\nThe 662 keV peak corresponds to the gamma-ray emission from the decay of Cs-137 (Cesium-137) to Ba-137m (Barium-137 metastable state). Cs-137 undergoes beta decay (β-) to form Ba-137m.\n\nThe 1173 keV peak corresponds to the gamma-ray emission from the decay of Co-60 (Cobalt-60) to Ni-60 (Nickel-60). Co-60 undergoes beta decay (β-) to form Ni-60.\n\nConsidering the presence of the 511 keV peak, it is likely that the sample contains a mixture of isotopes. The presence of the 662 keV and 1173 keV peaks suggests that the sample contains both Cs-137 and Co-60 isotopes. Cs-137 undergoes β- decay, while Co-60 also undergoes β- decay but with the additional emission of gamma rays at 1173 keV."
