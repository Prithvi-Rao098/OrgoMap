    "message_2": "To find the density of a substance, we can use the formula:\n\nDensity = Mass / Volume\n\nGiven the mass of titanium dioxide (TiO2) is 15 grams and the volume is 8.5 cm^3, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nDensity = 15 g / 8.5 cm^3\n\nDensity â‰ˆ 1.76 g/cm^3\n\nThe density of titanium dioxide (TiO2) with a mass of 15 grams and a volume of 8.5 cm^3 is approximately 1.76 g/cm^3."
