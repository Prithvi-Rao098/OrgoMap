    "message_1": "Here is a precise question for the student to solve:\n\nA chemical reaction occurs in a closed system that results in a change in temperature, but without any change in volume. Using non-equilibrium thermodynamics and irreversible processes, determine the amount of heat absorbed or released by the reaction if the entropy change is known to be 25 J/K.",
    "message_2": "To determine the amount of heat absorbed or released by the reaction, we can use the equation for the change in entropy (ΔS) in an irreversible process:\n\nΔS = q/T\n\nwhere ΔS is the change in entropy, q is the heat absorbed or released, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nIn this problem, we are given the change in entropy (ΔS = 25 J/K) but not the temperature (T). To solve for the heat absorbed or released (q), we need to know the temperature at which the reaction occurs.\n\nIf the temperature is provided, you can rearrange the equation to solve for q:\n\nq = ΔS * T\n\nPlug in the given values for ΔS and T, and you can calculate the heat absorbed or released by the reaction.\n\nHowever, without the temperature, it is not possible to determine the exact amount of heat absorbed or released by the reaction."
