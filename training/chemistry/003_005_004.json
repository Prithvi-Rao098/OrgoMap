    "message_2": "The electronic configuration of the carbon monoxide (CO) molecule can be determined by first looking at the individual electronic configurations of the carbon (C) and oxygen (O) atoms.\n\nCarbon (C) has an atomic number of 6, so its electronic configuration is 1s² 2s² 2p².\nOxygen (O) has an atomic number of 8, so its electronic configuration is 1s² 2s² 2p⁴.\n\nWhen these two atoms form a CO molecule, they share electrons to form molecular orbitals. The molecular orbital theory helps us understand the electronic configuration of the CO molecule. In the formation of CO, the 2s and 2p orbitals of both C and O atoms interact to form bonding (σ and π) and antibonding (σ* and π*) molecular orbitals.\n\nThe molecular orbital configuration of CO is:\nσ(2s)² σ*(2s)² σ(2pz)² π(2px)² π(2py)² π*(2px)¹ π*(2py)¹\n\nNow, we can calculate the bond order using the formula:\nBond order = (number of electrons in bonding orbitals - number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\n\nBond order = (6 - 4) / 2 = 2\n\nThe bond order of the CO molecule is 2, which indicates a double bond between the carbon and oxygen atoms.\n\nPredicting the exact bond length requires experimental data or high-level quantum mechanical calculations. However, we can make an educated guess based on the bond order and known bond lengths of similar molecules. A typical C=O double bond length is around 1.20-1.25 Å (angstroms)."
