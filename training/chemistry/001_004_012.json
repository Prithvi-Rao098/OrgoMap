    "message_2": "The reaction between methane (CH4) and chlorine (Cl2) under UV light is a radical halogenation reaction. The main product of this reaction is chloromethane (CH3Cl), along with a smaller amount of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), trichloromethane (CHCl3), and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). The reaction proceeds through a series of steps involving free radicals."
