    "message_2": "To identify the coordination complexes in the mixture and determine the wavelengths at which maximum absorbance occurs for each complex, we will first look at the individual complexes and their characteristic UV-Vis absorbance properties.\n\n1. FeCl3: This complex contains Fe(III) ions. Fe(III) complexes typically exhibit absorbance in the UV-Vis region due to d-d transitions. The specific wavelength of maximum absorbance for FeCl3 is around 300 nm.\n\n2. K3[Fe(CN)6]: This complex is also known as potassium ferricyanide and contains the [Fe(CN)6]3- ion. The Fe(III) ion is coordinated to six cyanide ligands in an octahedral geometry. The charge-transfer transitions in this complex result in a strong absorbance band at around 420 nm.\n\n3. Na2[Co(CN)4]: This complex is sodium tetracyanocobaltate(II) and contains the [Co(CN)4]2- ion. The Co(II) ion is coordinated to four cyanide ligands in a square planar geometry. The d-d transitions in this complex result in a weak absorbance band at around 510 nm.\n\n4. CuSO4: This complex contains Cu(II) ions. Cu(II) complexes typically exhibit absorbance in the UV-Vis region due to d-d transitions. The specific wavelength of maximum absorbance for CuSO4 is around 800 nm.\n\nTo identify the coordination complexes in the mixture, you would perform a UV-Vis spectroscopy analysis on the mixture and look for absorbance peaks at the characteristic wavelengths for each complex. The presence of a peak at a specific wavelength would indicate the presence of the corresponding complex in the mixture.\n\nIn summary, the wavelengths at which maximum absorbance occurs for each complex are:\n- FeCl3: ~300 nm\n- K3[Fe(CN)6]: ~420 nm\n- Na2[Co(CN)4]: ~510 nm\n- CuSO4: ~800 nm"
