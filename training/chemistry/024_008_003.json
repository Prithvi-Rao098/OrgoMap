    "message_2": "To design a safe storage and transportation system for hydrochloric acid (HCl) with a concentration of 37%, we need to consider the following factors:\n\n1. Storage tank size\n2. Appropriate materials for construction\n3. Necessary safety features\n4. Transportation methods\n\n1. Storage tank size:\nLet's assume we need to store 10,000 liters (10 m³) of 37% HCl solution. The storage tank should have a capacity slightly larger than the required volume to accommodate any expansion or changes in volume due to temperature fluctuations. We can consider a 10% extra capacity, so the required storage tank size would be 11,000 liters (11 m³).\n\n2. Appropriate materials for construction:\nHydrochloric acid is highly corrosive, so the storage tank and transportation containers should be made of materials resistant to its corrosive nature. Some suitable materials include:\n\n- High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE)\n- Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC)\n- Fiberglass Reinforced Plastic (FRP)\n- Rubber-lined steel\n- Hastelloy\n\nFor this design, we can choose HDPE as it is cost-effective and has good chemical resistance.\n\n3. Necessary safety features:\nTo ensure safe storage and handling of hydrochloric acid, the following safety features should be incorporated:\n\n- Secondary containment: A bund or containment area should be constructed around the storage tank to contain any leaks or spills.\n- Ventilation: Proper ventilation should be provided to prevent the buildup of HCl vapors.\n- Pressure relief valve: A pressure relief valve should be installed to release excess pressure in the storage tank.\n- Level indicator: A level indicator should be installed to monitor the liquid level in the storage tank.\n- Leak detection system: A leak detection system should be installed to detect any leaks in the storage tank or piping.\n- Personal protective equipment (PPE): Workers handling HCl should wear appropriate PPE, including acid-resistant gloves, goggles, and protective clothing.\n\n4. Transportation methods:\nFor transporting hydrochloric acid, the following methods can be used:\n\n- Road: Use a dedicated tanker truck made of suitable materials (e.g., HDPE) with proper labeling and placards indicating the hazardous nature of the cargo.\n- Rail: Use a dedicated rail tank car made of suitable materials (e.g., rubber-lined steel) with proper labeling and placards.\n- Sea: Use dedicated ISO tank containers made of suitable materials (e.g., FRP) with proper labeling and placards.\n\nIn summary, a safe storage and transportation system for 37% hydrochloric acid would involve an 11,000-liter HDPE storage tank with necessary safety features, and transportation using dedicated tanker trucks, rail tank cars, or ISO tank containers made of suitable materials. Proper handling procedures and PPE should be used by workers to ensure their safety."
