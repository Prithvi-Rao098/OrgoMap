    "message_2": "The predicted geometry of the inorganic molecule SF6 (sulfur hexafluoride) can be determined using the VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) theory. \n\nSulfur (S) is in group 16 of the periodic table and has 6 valence electrons. Each of the six fluorine (F) atoms has 7 valence electrons. In SF6, sulfur forms 6 covalent bonds with the fluorine atoms, utilizing all its valence electrons. There are no lone pairs of electrons on the sulfur atom.\n\nConsidering the 6 bonding pairs of electrons around the central sulfur atom, the VSEPR theory predicts an octahedral geometry for SF6. In an octahedral arrangement, the bond angles are 90 degrees, and the molecule has a symmetrical structure.\n\nAs for the polarity of SF6, we need to evaluate the electronegativity difference between sulfur and fluorine. Sulfur has an electronegativity value of 2.58, while fluorine has a value of 3.98. The electronegativity difference is significant, making the S-F bonds polar. However, due to the symmetrical arrangement of the six fluorine atoms around the central sulfur atom in an octahedral geometry, the individual bond dipoles cancel each other out, resulting in a nonpolar molecule.\n\nIn summary, the predicted geometry of SF6 is octahedral, and its polarity is nonpolar."
