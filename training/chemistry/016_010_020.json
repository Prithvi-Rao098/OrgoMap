Assume that the specific heat capacity of the solution is 4.18 J/g°C and that the density of the solution is 1.00 g/mL.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the dissolution of sodium hydroxide in water, we can use the formula:\n\nΔH = mcΔT\n\nwhere m is the mass of the solution, c is the specific heat capacity of the solution, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nFirst, we need to find the mass of the solution. Since the density of the solution is 1.00 g/mL, we can convert the volume of water (100.0 mL) to mass:\n\nmass of water = volume × density = 100.0 mL × 1.00 g/mL = 100.0 g\n\nNow, we add the mass of sodium hydroxide (10.0 g) to the mass of water (100.0 g) to get the total mass of the solution:\n\nmass of solution = mass of water + mass of NaOH = 100.0 g + 10.0 g = 110.0 g\n\nNext, we calculate the change in temperature (ΔT):\n\nΔT = final temperature - initial temperature = 31.0 °C - 25.0 °C = 6.0 °C\n\nNow, we can use the formula to calculate the enthalpy change (ΔH):\n\nΔH = mcΔT = (110.0 g)(4.18 J/g°C)(6.0 °C) = 2759.6 J\n\nThe enthalpy change for the dissolution of 10.0 grams of sodium hydroxide in 100.0 mL of water is 2759.6 J."
