    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant (K) of the electrochemical reaction, we first need to determine the overall cell potential (E°cell) for the reaction. This can be done using the standard reduction potentials given:\n\nE°cell = E°(cathode) - E°(anode)\n\nIn this case, the Cu2+(aq)/Cu(s) half-cell has a higher reduction potential, so it will act as the cathode, while the Fe2+(aq)/Fe(s) half-cell will act as the anode.\n\nE°cell = (+0.34 V) - (-0.44 V) = 0.78 V\n\nNow, we can use the Nernst equation to relate the cell potential to the equilibrium constant. The Nernst equation is:\n\nE°cell = (RT/nF) * ln(K)\n\nWhere:\n- R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\n- T is the temperature in Kelvin (298 K)\n- n is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction (2 electrons, as both Cu2+ and Fe2+ have a charge of +2)\n- F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol)\n\nRearranging the Nernst equation to solve for K, we get:\n\nK = exp(nFE°cell/RT)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nK = exp((2 * 96,485 C/mol * 0.78 V) / (8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K))\n\nK = exp(151,658 / 2,467)\n\nK = exp(61.47)\n\nK ≈ 4.3 × 10^26\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (K) for the given electrochemical reaction at 298 K is approximately 4.3 × 10^26."
