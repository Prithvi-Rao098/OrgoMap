    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic moment of the tetrahedral complex [FeCl4]2-, we first need to find the oxidation state of the iron (Fe) atom and its electron configuration.\n\nThe complex [FeCl4]2- has a charge of -2, and since each chloride (Cl) ion has a charge of -1, the oxidation state of Fe in this complex is +2.\n\nThe electron configuration of Fe is [Ar] 3d^6 4s^2. When Fe loses two electrons to achieve a +2 oxidation state, its electron configuration becomes [Ar] 3d^6 → [Ar] 3d^4.\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of unpaired electrons in the 3d orbitals. In the case of [FeCl4]2-, the Fe(II) ion has a high-spin configuration due to the weak field ligand (Cl-). The electron configuration for high-spin Fe(II) is:\n\n3d: ↑↓   ↑↓   ↑   ↑   ↑\n\nThere are 4 unpaired electrons in the 3d orbitals.\n\nThe magnetic moment (μ) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nμ = √(n(n+2)),\n\nwhere n is the number of unpaired electrons.\n\nμ = √(4(4+2))\nμ = √(4(6))\nμ = √24\nμ ≈ 4.9 Bohr magnetons\n\nSo, the magnetic moment of the tetrahedral complex [FeCl4]2- is approximately 4.9 Bohr magnetons."
