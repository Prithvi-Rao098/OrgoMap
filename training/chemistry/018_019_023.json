    "message_2": "The equilibrium constant (K) for a given chemical reaction is not affected by the variation in the reaction rate. The equilibrium constant is a thermodynamic quantity that depends only on the temperature and the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) of the reaction. It is independent of the reaction rate, which is a kinetic property.\n\nThe reaction rate depends on factors such as the concentration of reactants, temperature, and the presence of catalysts. However, these factors do not change the equilibrium constant. The equilibrium constant remains constant for a given reaction at a constant temperature, regardless of the rate at which the reaction proceeds.\n\nIn summary, the variation in the reaction rate does not affect the equilibrium constant for a given chemical reaction, as the equilibrium constant is a thermodynamic property and is independent of kinetic factors."
