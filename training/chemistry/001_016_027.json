    "message_2": "The electrophilic addition of hydrogen bromide (HBr) to 1,3-butadiene involves a two-step reaction mechanism with the formation of an intermediate carbocation. Here's the step-by-step mechanism:\n\nStep 1: Electrophilic attack on the double bond\nThe nucleophilic pi electrons of the double bond in 1,3-butadiene attack the electrophilic hydrogen atom of HBr. This results in the formation of a new C-H bond and the breaking of the H-Br bond. The bromide ion (Br-) is released as a leaving group, and a carbocation intermediate is formed at the allylic position (carbon 2).\n\nStep 2: Nucleophilic attack on the carbocation\nThe bromide ion (Br-), which was released in the first step, acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbocation at the allylic position (carbon 2). This leads to the formation of a new C-Br bond and the final product, 3-bromo-1-butene.\n\nIt's important to note that there is another possible intermediate in this reaction, which is the 1,2-addition product. However, due to the resonance stabilization of the allylic carbocation formed in the 1,4-addition pathway, the 1,4-addition product (3-bromo-1-butene) is the major product in this reaction. This phenomenon is known as the regioselectivity of 1,3-butadiene and is an example of the kinetic versus thermodynamic control of reactions."
