    "message_2": "Methane (CH4) does not have a carbon-carbon single bond. It consists of one carbon atom bonded to four hydrogen atoms. Therefore, it is not possible to calculate the bond dissociation energy required to break a carbon-carbon single bond in methane. However, if you would like to know the bond dissociation energy for breaking a carbon-hydrogen bond in methane, I can provide that information.\n\nThe bond dissociation energy for a carbon-hydrogen bond in methane is approximately 439 kJ/mol."
