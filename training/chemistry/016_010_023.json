Given: 10g of NaCl was dissolved in 500mL of water at room temperature (25°C) and the temperature change was recorded as -3.2°C. The specific heat capacity of the solution is 4.18 J/g°C. Calculate the enthalpy change in kJ/mol.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change of NaCl dissolution in water, we can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat absorbed or released, m is the mass of the solution, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the temperature change.\n\nFirst, we need to find the mass of the solution. Since the density of water is approximately 1 g/mL, the mass of 500 mL of water is 500 g. Adding the mass of NaCl, we get:\n\nm = 500 g (water) + 10 g (NaCl) = 510 g\n\nNext, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nq = (510 g)(4.18 J/g°C)(-3.2°C) = -6811.68 J\n\nSince the value is negative, it means that the dissolution of NaCl in water is exothermic (releases heat).\n\nNow, we need to convert the heat released to kJ/mol. First, convert the heat to kJ:\n\nq = -6811.68 J * (1 kJ / 1000 J) = -6.81168 kJ\n\nNext, we need to find the number of moles of NaCl. The molar mass of NaCl is 58.44 g/mol:\n\nmoles of NaCl = 10 g / 58.44 g/mol = 0.1711 mol\n\nFinally, we can find the enthalpy change per mole:\n\nΔH = -6.81168 kJ / 0.1711 mol = -39.8 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change of NaCl dissolution in water is approximately -39.8 kJ/mol."
