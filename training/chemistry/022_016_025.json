    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change (ΔH) of the reaction, we can use the following formula:\n\nΔH = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants)\n\nFor this reaction, the products are 2 moles of H2O, and the reactants are 2 moles of H2 and 1 mole of O2. Using the given standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°), we can plug in the values:\n\nΔH = [2 × (-286 kJ/mol)] - [(2 × 0 kJ/mol) + (1 × 0 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH = (-572 kJ) - (0 kJ)\n\nΔH = -572 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change for the reaction is -572 kJ."
