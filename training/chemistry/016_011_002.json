    "message_2": "To calculate the heat of mixing, we first need to determine the number of moles of HCl and NaOH reacting. Since both solutions have the same concentration and volume, they will react in a 1:1 ratio.\n\nNumber of moles of HCl = (concentration of HCl) × (volume of HCl)\n= 1 M × 0.050 L = 0.050 moles\n\nNumber of moles of NaOH = (concentration of NaOH) × (volume of NaOH)\n= 1 M × 0.050 L = 0.050 moles\n\nNow, we can use the enthalpy of neutralization to calculate the heat of mixing.\n\nHeat of mixing = (number of moles of HCl) × (enthalpy of neutralization)\n= 0.050 moles × -55.9 kJ/mol = -2.795 kJ\n\nThe heat of mixing when 50 mL of 1 M HCl is added to 50 mL of 1 M NaOH at 25°C is -2.795 kJ, assuming no heat loss to the surroundings."
