    "message_1": "How much chlorine gas (in grams) is needed to prepare 50 g of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid by the reaction of benzoic acid and chlorine gas assuming a 90% yield?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the following steps:\n\n1. Write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction.\n2. Calculate the moles of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid produced.\n3. Use stoichiometry to find the moles of chlorine gas needed.\n4. Convert moles of chlorine gas to grams.\n\n1. Balanced chemical equation:\nC7H6O2 (benzoic acid) + 2 Cl2 (chlorine gas) â†’ C7H4Cl2O2 (2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid)\n\n2. Calculate the moles of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid produced:\nFirst, we need to find the molar mass of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid:\nC: 12.01 g/mol * 7 = 84.07 g/mol\nH: 1.01 g/mol * 4 = 4.04 g/mol\nCl: 35.45 g/mol * 2 = 70.9 g/mol\nO: 16.00 g/mol * 2 = 32.00 g/mol\nTotal molar mass = 84.07 + 4.04 + 70.9 + 32.00 = 191.01 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the moles of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid produced:\nmoles = mass / molar mass\nmoles = 50 g / 191.01 g/mol = 0.2618 mol\n\nSince the yield is 90%, we need to find the moles of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid that would be produced without considering the yield:\n0.2618 mol / 0.9 = 0.2910 mol\n\n3. Use stoichiometry to find the moles of chlorine gas needed:\nFrom the balanced chemical equation, we can see that 1 mole of benzoic acid reacts with 2 moles of chlorine gas to produce 1 mole of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid. Therefore, the moles of chlorine gas needed are:\n0.2910 mol * 2 = 0.5820 mol\n\n4. Convert moles of chlorine gas to grams:\nThe molar mass of chlorine gas (Cl2) is 2 * 35.45 g/mol = 70.9 g/mol.\ngrams of chlorine gas = moles * molar mass\ngrams of chlorine gas = 0.5820 mol * 70.9 g/mol = 41.26 g\n\nSo, 41.26 grams of chlorine gas are needed to prepare 50 grams of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid with a 90% yield."
