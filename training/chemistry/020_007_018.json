    "message_2": "Increasing the pressure in a closed system at equilibrium with a gaseous reactant and product will affect the equilibrium position according to Le Châtelier's principle. Le Châtelier's principle states that if a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in pressure, temperature, or concentration of reactants and products, the system will adjust its equilibrium position to counteract the change.\n\nTo understand how increasing pressure affects the equilibrium position, consider the following balanced chemical equation for the synthesis of ammonia:\n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g)\n\nIn this reaction, nitrogen gas (N2) reacts with hydrogen gas (H2) to form ammonia gas (NH3). The equilibrium constant for this reaction is given by:\n\nK = [NH3]^2 / ([N2] * [H2]^3)\n\nwhere [NH3], [N2], and [H2] represent the equilibrium concentrations of ammonia, nitrogen, and hydrogen, respectively.\n\nWhen the pressure in the closed system is increased, the system will respond by shifting the equilibrium position to reduce the pressure. In this case, the equilibrium will shift in the direction that has fewer moles of gas. For the ammonia synthesis reaction, there are 4 moles of gas on the reactant side (1 mole of N2 and 3 moles of H2) and 2 moles of gas on the product side (2 moles of NH3). Therefore, increasing the pressure will shift the equilibrium position to the right, favoring the formation of ammonia.\n\nExperimental evidence supporting this observation can be found in the Haber-Bosch process, which is an industrial method for producing ammonia. In this process, nitrogen and hydrogen gases are combined at high pressures (typically around 200 atm) and temperatures (around 450°C) in the presence of an iron catalyst. The high pressure used in the Haber-Bosch process shifts the equilibrium position to favor ammonia production, resulting in a higher yield of ammonia.\n\nIn summary, increasing the pressure in a closed system at equilibrium with a gaseous reactant and product will shift the equilibrium position in the direction that has fewer moles of gas, according to Le Châtelier's principle. This observation is supported by experimental evidence from the Haber-Bosch process, which uses high pressure to increase the yield of ammonia."
