    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the vaporization of 50 g of water, we first need to determine the number of moles of water present. The molar mass of water (H2O) is 18.015 g/mol.\n\nNumber of moles = mass / molar mass\nNumber of moles = 50 g / 18.015 g/mol = 2.775 moles\n\nNow, we can use the molar heat of vaporization (40.7 kJ/mol) to calculate the standard enthalpy change.\n\nStandard enthalpy change = number of moles × molar heat of vaporization\nStandard enthalpy change = 2.775 moles × 40.7 kJ/mol = 112.94 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the vaporization of 50 g of water at its boiling point of 100°C is 112.94 kJ."
