    "message_2": "To determine the electronic excitation energy and oscillator strength of the lowest excited state in a molecule of naphthalene, we need to refer to experimental or computational data. Naphthalene is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with the molecular formula C10H8. Its structure consists of two fused benzene rings.\n\nThe electronic excitation energy corresponds to the energy difference between the ground state and the lowest excited state of the molecule. This energy can be obtained from experimental techniques such as UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy or from computational methods like time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations.\n\nFor naphthalene, the lowest excited state is the S1 state, which corresponds to a π-π* transition. Based on experimental data, the excitation energy for this transition is approximately 3.8 eV (electron volts) or around 326 nm in terms of wavelength.\n\nThe oscillator strength is a dimensionless quantity that represents the probability of an electronic transition occurring between two energy levels. It is related to the intensity of the absorption band in the UV-Vis spectrum. Oscillator strengths can also be obtained from experimental data or calculated using computational methods.\n\nFor naphthalene, the oscillator strength of the lowest excited state (S1) is approximately 0.14 based on experimental data.\n\nPlease note that these values may vary slightly depending on the source of the data and the method used to obtain them."
