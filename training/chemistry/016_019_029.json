The initial and final pressures of the nitrogen gas are 1.0 atm and 0.8 atm, respectively, and the surface area of the activated charcoal is 25.0 cm². The heat of adsorption for nitrogen gas at 298 K is -56.2 kJ/mol.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of adsorption, we can use the following formula:\n\nEnthalpy of adsorption = moles of gas adsorbed × heat of adsorption\n\nFirst, we need to determine the moles of nitrogen gas adsorbed. We can do this by using the initial and final pressures of the nitrogen gas:\n\nInitial moles of N2 = 2.5 moles (given)\nInitial pressure = 1.0 atm (given)\nFinal pressure = 0.8 atm (given)\n\nUsing the ideal gas law, we can relate the initial and final moles of nitrogen gas:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nWhere P is pressure, V is volume, n is moles, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is temperature. Since the volume and temperature remain constant, we can set up the following equation:\n\nP1 * n1 = P2 * n2\n\n1.0 atm * 2.5 moles = 0.8 atm * n2\n\nSolving for n2:\n\nn2 = (1.0 atm * 2.5 moles) / 0.8 atm\nn2 = 3.125 moles\n\nNow, we can find the moles of nitrogen gas adsorbed:\n\nMoles of N2 adsorbed = Initial moles - Final moles\nMoles of N2 adsorbed = 2.5 moles - 3.125 moles\nMoles of N2 adsorbed = -0.625 moles\n\nSince the moles of N2 adsorbed is negative, it means that 0.625 moles of nitrogen gas were desorbed from the activated charcoal. Therefore, the enthalpy of adsorption will also be negative:\n\nEnthalpy of adsorption = -0.625 moles × -56.2 kJ/mol\nEnthalpy of adsorption = 35.125 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy of adsorption for the adsorption of 2.5 moles of nitrogen gas on the surface of activated charcoal at 298 K is 35.125 kJ."
