",
    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH_reaction = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nFirst, we need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\n2 MgO (s) + 4 HCl (aq) → 2 MgCl2 (aq) + 2 H2O (l)\n\nNow, we need to find the standard enthalpy change of formation for the products, magnesium chloride (MgCl2) and water (H2O). We can use the given data for the reactants and the fact that the reaction is exothermic and releases 942.23 kJ of energy.\n\nΔH_reaction = -942.23 kJ\n\nΣ ΔH_f(reactants) = 2 * (-601.8 kJ/mol) + 4 * (-167.2 kJ/mol) = -1203.6 kJ/mol - 668.8 kJ/mol = -1872.4 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can solve for the standard enthalpy change of formation for the products:\n\n-942.23 kJ = Σ ΔH_f(products) - (-1872.4 kJ/mol)\nΣ ΔH_f(products) = -942.23 kJ + 1872.4 kJ/mol = 930.17 kJ/mol\n\nSince there are 2 moles of MgCl2 and 2 moles of H2O in the balanced equation, we can divide the sum of the standard enthalpy change of formation for the products by 4 to find the average standard enthalpy change per mole of product:\n\nΔH_reaction (per mole of product) = 930.17 kJ/mol / 4 = 232.54 kJ/mol\n\nThus, the standard enthalpy change for the reaction of 2 moles of solid magnesium oxide reacting with 4 moles of hydrochloric acid at standard conditions is approximately 232.54 kJ/mol."
