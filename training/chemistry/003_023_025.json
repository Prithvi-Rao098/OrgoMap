    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat released when 10.0 g of methane is burned completely, we need to use the enthalpy of combustion and the molar mass of methane.\n\nFirst, let's find the moles of methane:\n\nMolar mass of methane (CH4) = 12.01 g/mol (C) + 4 * 1.01 g/mol (H) = 12.01 + 4.04 = 16.05 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the moles of methane:\n\nmoles = mass / molar mass\nmoles = 10.0 g / 16.05 g/mol = 0.623 mol\n\nNow, we can use the enthalpy of combustion to find the heat released:\n\nHeat released = moles * enthalpy of combustion\nHeat released = 0.623 mol * -890 kJ/mol = -554.47 kJ\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the heat is released (exothermic reaction).\n\nSo, the amount of heat released when 10.0 g of methane is burned completely in excess oxygen is 554.47 kJ."
