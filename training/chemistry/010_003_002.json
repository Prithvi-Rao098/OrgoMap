    "message_2": "To calculate the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) for the given electrochemical reaction, we first need to determine the overall cell potential (E°) for the reaction. \n\nThe overall cell potential can be found by subtracting the standard reduction potential of the half-reaction being oxidized from the standard reduction potential of the half-reaction being reduced. In this case, Cu(s) is being oxidized to Cu²⁺(aq), and Ag⁺(aq) is being reduced to Ag(s).\n\nE°(cell) = E°(reduction) - E°(oxidation)\n\nSince the given half-reactions are:\n\nCu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Cu(s) E° = +0.34 V (reduction)\nAg⁺(aq) + e⁻ → Ag(s) E° = +0.80 V (reduction)\n\nWe need to reverse the Cu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Cu(s) half-reaction to represent the oxidation of Cu(s) to Cu²⁺(aq):\n\nCu(s) → Cu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ E° = -0.34 V (oxidation)\n\nNow we can calculate the overall cell potential:\n\nE°(cell) = E°(reduction) - E°(oxidation)\nE°(cell) = (+0.80 V) - (-0.34 V)\nE°(cell) = +1.14 V\n\nNow that we have the overall cell potential, we can calculate the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) using the following equation:\n\nΔG° = -nFE°\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the reaction, F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol), and E° is the overall cell potential.\n\nIn this reaction, 2 moles of electrons are transferred (from Cu to 2Ag⁺):\n\nΔG° = -(2 mol)(96,485 C/mol)(+1.14 V)\nΔG° = -219,663.8 J/mol\n\nSince the standard Gibbs free energy change is typically expressed in kJ/mol, we can convert it:\n\nΔG° = -219.66 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) for the given electrochemical reaction is -219.66 kJ/mol."
