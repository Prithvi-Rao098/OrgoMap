    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the fusion of 50.0 g of ice, we first need to determine the number of moles of ice. The molar mass of water (H2O) is 18.015 g/mol.\n\nNumber of moles = mass / molar mass\nNumber of moles = 50.0 g / 18.015 g/mol = 2.776 moles\n\nNow, we can use the molar enthalpy of fusion to calculate the enthalpy change.\n\nEnthalpy change = number of moles × molar enthalpy of fusion\nEnthalpy change = 2.776 moles × 6.01 kJ/mol = 16.681 kJ\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy change for the fusion of 50.0 g of ice at its melting point is 16.681 kJ."
