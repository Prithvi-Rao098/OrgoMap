    "message_2": "To calculate the activation energy of the reaction, we need the experimental data, such as the reaction rate constants at different temperatures or the Arrhenius plot. Unfortunately, you have not provided any experimental data. \n\nHowever, I can explain the process of calculating the activation energy using the Arrhenius equation if you provide the necessary data. The Arrhenius equation is:\n\nk = Ae^(-Ea/RT)\n\nwhere:\nk = reaction rate constant\nA = pre-exponential factor (also known as the frequency factor)\nEa = activation energy (J/mol)\nR = gas constant (8.314 J/mol*K)\nT = temperature (K)\n\nTo find the activation energy, you would typically need the reaction rate constants (k) at two different temperatures (T1 and T2). Then, you can use the following equation:\n\nln(k2/k1) = (Ea/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2)\n\nSolving for Ea, you get:\n\nEa = R * (ln(k2/k1) / (1/T1 - 1/T2))\n\nOnce you have the experimental data, you can plug the values into this equation to calculate the activation energy in Joules per mole."
