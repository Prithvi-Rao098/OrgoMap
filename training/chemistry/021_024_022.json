    "message_2": "To calculate the bond order and predict the stability of the O2 molecule using molecular orbital theory, we first need to determine the number of valence electrons in the molecule. Oxygen has 6 valence electrons, and since there are two oxygen atoms in O2, the molecule has a total of 12 valence electrons.\n\nNext, we need to fill the molecular orbitals with these electrons following the Aufbau principle, which states that electrons fill the lowest energy orbitals first. The order of energy levels for molecular orbitals in diatomic molecules is:\n\n1. σ1s\n2. σ*1s\n3. σ2s\n4. σ*2s\n5. π2p (degenerate orbitals)\n6. π*2p (degenerate orbitals)\n7. σ2p\n\nNow, let's fill the orbitals with the 12 valence electrons:\n\n1. σ1s: 2 electrons\n2. σ*1s: 2 electrons\n3. σ2s: 2 electrons\n4. σ*2s: 2 electrons\n5. π2p: 4 electrons (2 in each degenerate orbital)\n6. π*2p: 0 electrons\n7. σ2p: 0 electrons\n\nThe bond order can be calculated using the formula:\n\nBond order = (number of electrons in bonding orbitals - number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\n\nIn the case of O2:\n\nBond order = (2 + 2 + 4 - 2 - 2) / 2 = 2\n\nThe bond order of O2 is 2, which indicates a double bond between the two oxygen atoms. A bond order greater than 0 suggests that the molecule is stable. In this case, the O2 molecule is stable with a double bond between the oxygen atoms."
