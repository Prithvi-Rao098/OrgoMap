    "message_2": "Chemistry students can effectively educate themselves and improve their skills in the absence of proper funding for chemistry education by utilizing the following strategies:\n\n1. Online resources: There are numerous free online resources available for chemistry students, including educational websites, YouTube channels, and open-access journals. These resources can provide valuable information on various chemistry topics, as well as tutorials and practice problems.\n\n2. Open-source textbooks: Many open-source textbooks are available online for free or at a low cost. These textbooks can serve as an alternative to expensive, traditional textbooks and provide comprehensive information on various chemistry subjects.\n\n3. Study groups: Forming study groups with fellow students can help in sharing knowledge, discussing complex concepts, and working on practice problems together. This collaborative learning approach can be highly beneficial in enhancing one's understanding of chemistry.\n\n4. Online courses and MOOCs: Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and other online courses can provide structured learning opportunities in various chemistry topics. Many of these courses are available for free or at a low cost, making them accessible to students with limited funding.\n\n5. Utilize the library: Public and university libraries often have a wealth of chemistry resources, including textbooks, reference materials, and scientific journals. Students can take advantage of these resources to supplement their learning.\n\n6. Attend seminars and workshops: Many universities and research institutions offer free seminars and workshops on various chemistry topics. Attending these events can help students gain exposure to new ideas and research in the field.\n\n7. Seek mentorship: Connecting with professors, teaching assistants, or experienced peers can provide valuable guidance and support in learning chemistry. These mentors can offer insights into complex concepts, recommend resources, and provide feedback on assignments and projects.\n\n8. Practice problem-solving: Regularly working on chemistry problems and exercises can help students develop their problem-solving skills and deepen their understanding of the subject. Students can find practice problems in textbooks, online resources, or by creating their own.\n\n9. Stay updated with current research: Following the latest research in chemistry can help students stay informed about new discoveries and developments in the field. Students can read scientific journals, attend conferences, or follow chemistry-related news outlets to stay updated.\n\n10. Develop lab skills: While access to a well-equipped lab may be limited due to funding constraints, students can still develop their lab skills by practicing basic techniques at home or by participating in lab-based courses or workshops when possible."
