    "message_2": "To calculate the standard free energy change (ΔG°) for the redox reaction, we first need to determine the standard cell potential (E°cell) for the reaction. The standard cell potential can be found using the following equation:\n\nE°cell = E°cathode - E°anode\n\nIn this reaction, Fe2+ is being oxidized to Fe3+, so it is the anode, and Sn4+ is being reduced to Sn2+, so it is the cathode. Therefore, we can plug in the given values:\n\nE°cell = E°Sn4+/Sn2+ - E°Fe3+/Fe2+\nE°cell = 0.150 V - 0.771 V\nE°cell = -0.621 V\n\nNow that we have the standard cell potential, we can calculate the standard free energy change using the following equation:\n\nΔG° = -nFE°cell\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the reaction, F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol), and E°cell is the standard cell potential.\n\nIn this reaction, 1 mole of electrons is transferred (Fe2+ loses 1 electron to become Fe3+, and Sn4+ gains 1 electron to become Sn2+), so n = 1.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nΔG° = -(1 mol)(96,485 C/mol)(-0.621 V)\nΔG° = 59,923.485 J/mol\n\nSince the standard free energy change is typically expressed in kJ/mol, we can convert the value:\n\nΔG° = 59.923 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard free energy change for the redox reaction is 59.923 kJ/mol."
