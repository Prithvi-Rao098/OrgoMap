    "message_2": "To determine the nuclear binding energy, we first need to convert the mass defect from atomic mass units (amu) to energy using the conversion factor provided.\n\nMass defect = 0.0304 amu\n\nConversion factor: 1 amu = 931.5 MeV/c²\n\nNow, we can convert the mass defect to energy:\n\nEnergy = Mass defect × Conversion factor\nEnergy = 0.0304 amu × 931.5 MeV/c²\n\nEnergy ≈ 28.3176 MeV\n\nSo, the nuclear binding energy for a helium nucleus with a mass of 4.0026 amu is approximately 28.32 MeV."
