    "message_2": "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful technique used to study the molecular structure and dynamics of organic compounds. In this case, we will focus on 1H NMR spectroscopy, which provides information about the hydrogen atoms in a molecule.\n\nPropene (C3H6) and propane (C3H8) are both hydrocarbons with three carbon atoms, but they have different structures. Propene contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), while propane has only single bonds (C-C). This difference in structure will lead to distinguishable NMR spectra for each compound.\n\n1. Chemical Shifts:\nThe chemical shift is the position of the NMR signal relative to a reference compound (usually tetramethylsilane, TMS). It is measured in parts per million (ppm) and provides information about the electronic environment of the hydrogen atoms in a molecule.\n\nIn propene, the hydrogen atoms directly attached to the carbon-carbon double bond (vinyl hydrogens) will have a different chemical shift compared to the hydrogen atoms attached to the single-bonded carbon (methyl hydrogens). The vinyl hydrogens typically appear around 4.5-6.0 ppm, while the methyl hydrogens appear around 0.8-2.0 ppm.\n\nIn propane, all hydrogen atoms are equivalent and are part of a methyl group. Therefore, there will be only one signal in the NMR spectrum, typically around 0.8-1.2 ppm.\n\n2. Integration:\nIntegration of the NMR signals indicates the relative number of hydrogen atoms contributing to each signal. In propene, the integration ratio of the vinyl hydrogens to the methyl hydrogens will be 2:3. In propane, there will be only one signal with an integration value of 8, representing all eight hydrogen atoms.\n\n3. Multiplicity (Splitting Patterns):\nMultiplicity provides information about the number of neighboring hydrogen atoms. In propene, the vinyl hydrogens will show a doublet due to the coupling with the methyl hydrogens, while the methyl hydrogens will show a triplet due to the coupling with the vinyl hydrogens. In propane, the single signal will show a septet, as each methyl hydrogen has six neighboring hydrogens on the adjacent carbon.\n\nIn summary, the NMR spectra of propene and propane can be distinguished by their chemical shifts, integration values, and splitting patterns. The spectra provide information about the molecular structure, including the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond in propene and the number of hydrogen atoms attached to each carbon atom."
