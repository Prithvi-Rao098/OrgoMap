    "message_2": "To calculate the theoretical yield of benzocaine, we need to use stoichiometry. First, we need to know the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\np-aminobenzoic acid + ethanol → benzocaine + water\n\nNow, we need the molar masses of p-aminobenzoic acid and benzocaine:\n\np-aminobenzoic acid (C7H7NO2): 7(12.01) + 7(1.01) + 1(14.01) + 2(16.00) = 137.14 g/mol\nbenzocaine (C9H11NO2): 9(12.01) + 11(1.01) + 1(14.01) + 2(16.00) = 165.19 g/mol\n\nNext, we need to convert the mass of p-aminobenzoic acid to moles:\n\n5 g p-aminobenzoic acid × (1 mol p-aminobenzoic acid / 137.14 g p-aminobenzoic acid) = 0.0364 mol p-aminobenzoic acid\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, the moles of benzocaine produced will be equal to the moles of p-aminobenzoic acid:\n\n0.0364 mol p-aminobenzoic acid × (1 mol benzocaine / 1 mol p-aminobenzoic acid) = 0.0364 mol benzocaine\n\nFinally, we convert the moles of benzocaine to grams:\n\n0.0364 mol benzocaine × (165.19 g benzocaine / 1 mol benzocaine) = 6.01 g benzocaine\n\nThe theoretical yield of benzocaine that can be produced from 5 grams of p-aminobenzoic acid and excess ethanol in the preparation process is 6.01 grams."
