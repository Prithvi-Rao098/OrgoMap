    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 10 grams of sucrose, we first need to determine the number of moles of sucrose present. The molar mass of sucrose (C12H22O11) is:\n\n(12 x 12.01) + (22 x 1.01) + (11 x 16.00) = 144.12 + 22.22 + 176.00 = 342.34 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the number of moles of sucrose in 10 grams:\n\nmoles = mass / molar mass = 10 g / 342.34 g/mol = 0.0292 mol\n\nSince the enthalpy of hydrolysis of sucrose is -564.9 kJ/mol, we can now calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 10 grams of sucrose:\n\nenthalpy change = moles x enthalpy of hydrolysis = 0.0292 mol x (-564.9 kJ/mol) = -16.48 kJ\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 10 grams of sucrose in an aqueous solution is approximately -16.48 kJ."
