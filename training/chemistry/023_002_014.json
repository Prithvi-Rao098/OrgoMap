    "message_2": "To calculate the theoretical yield of benzocaine, we need to first determine the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between p-aminobenzoic acid and ethanol. The reaction is an esterification reaction, which can be represented as follows:\n\np-aminobenzoic acid + ethanol → benzocaine + water\n\nThe balanced equation is:\n\nC7H7NO2 + C2H5OH → C9H11NO2 + H2O\n\nNow, we need to find the stoichiometry of the reaction. From the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of p-aminobenzoic acid reacts with 1 mole of ethanol to produce 1 mole of benzocaine. \n\nWe are given 1.5 moles of p-aminobenzoic acid and excess ethanol, so the limiting reagent is p-aminobenzoic acid. \n\nThe theoretical yield of benzocaine, assuming complete conversion, would be equal to the moles of the limiting reagent, which is 1.5 moles of p-aminobenzoic acid. However, we are given a 95% yield, so we need to account for this.\n\nTheoretical yield of benzocaine = (1.5 moles p-aminobenzoic acid) × (95% yield)\nTheoretical yield of benzocaine = 1.5 × 0.95\nTheoretical yield of benzocaine = 1.425 moles\n\nSo, the theoretical yield of benzocaine that can be produced from 1.5 moles of p-aminobenzoic acid and excess ethanol, assuming a 95% yield, is 1.425 moles."
