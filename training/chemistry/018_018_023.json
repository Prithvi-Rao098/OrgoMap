    "message_2": "Changing the concentration of reactants or products in a chemical reaction at equilibrium will affect the reaction rate according to Le Chatelier's principle. This principle states that if a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in concentration, temperature, or pressure, the system will adjust to counteract the change and restore a new equilibrium.\n\nWhen the concentration of reactants is increased, the reaction will shift towards the products to restore equilibrium, thus increasing the reaction rate. Conversely, if the concentration of products is increased, the reaction will shift towards the reactants, decreasing the reaction rate.\n\nSimilarly, if the concentration of reactants is decreased, the reaction will shift towards the reactants, decreasing the reaction rate. And if the concentration of products is decreased, the reaction will shift towards the products, increasing the reaction rate.\n\nIn summary, changing the concentration of reactants or products in a chemical reaction at equilibrium will cause the system to adjust and restore a new equilibrium, affecting the reaction rate accordingly."
