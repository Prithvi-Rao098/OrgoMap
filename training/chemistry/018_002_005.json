    "message_2": "The rate constant (k) for a first-order reaction can be determined using the half-life (t1/2) of the reaction. The relationship between the rate constant and half-life for a first-order reaction is given by the formula:\n\nk = ln(2) / t1/2\n\nwhere ln(2) is the natural logarithm of 2 (approximately 0.693) and t1/2 is the half-life in the same units as the rate constant (in this case, minutes).\n\nGiven a half-life of 10 minutes, we can calculate the rate constant as follows:\n\nk = 0.693 / 10\n\nk ≈ 0.0693 min⁻¹\n\nSo, the rate constant for this first-order reaction is approximately 0.0693 min⁻¹. Note that the initial concentration of the reactant (0.1 M) is not needed to calculate the rate constant for a first-order reaction."
