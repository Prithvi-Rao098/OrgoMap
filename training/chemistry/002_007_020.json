    "message_2": "When calcium carbonate (CaCO3) is heated, it undergoes a decomposition reaction to form calcium oxide (CaO) and carbon dioxide (CO2). The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nCaCO3 (s) â†’ CaO (s) + CO2 (g)\n\nIn this equation, (s) denotes the solid state and (g) denotes the gas state. So, calcium carbonate is a solid, calcium oxide is also a solid, and carbon dioxide is a gas."
