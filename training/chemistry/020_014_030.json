    "message_1": "What is the new ionization constant if the temperature of a weak acid solution is increased from 25°C to 35°C? The original ionization constant of the weak acid is 1.5 x 10^-5 at 25°C.",
    "message_2": "To determine the new ionization constant at 35°C, we can use the Van't Hoff equation, which relates the temperature dependence of the equilibrium constant (K) to the enthalpy change (ΔH) of the reaction:\n\nln(K2/K1) = -ΔH/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere K1 and K2 are the ionization constants at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), and ΔH is the enthalpy change of the reaction.\n\nHowever, we do not have the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the ionization of the weak acid. Without this information, we cannot calculate the new ionization constant at 35°C.\n\nIf you can provide the enthalpy change for the ionization of the weak acid, we can proceed with the calculation."
