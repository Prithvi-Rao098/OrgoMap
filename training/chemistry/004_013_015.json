    "message_1": "What is the concentration of copper ions in a 25 mL sample of a 0.05 M copper sulfate solution when the sample is analyzed using coulometry with a current of 2.5 A for 10 seconds?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of copper ions reduced during the coulometry process and then calculate the new concentration of copper ions in the solution.\n\nFirst, let's find the amount of charge passed through the solution during the coulometry process:\n\nq = I × t\nwhere q is the charge, I is the current, and t is the time.\n\nq = 2.5 A × 10 s = 25 Coulombs\n\nNow, we need to find the number of moles of electrons involved in the reduction of copper ions:\n\nCopper sulfate (CuSO₄) dissociates into copper ions (Cu²⁺) and sulfate ions (SO₄²⁻) in the solution. The reduction of copper ions involves the following reaction:\n\nCu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu\n\nFrom the reaction, we can see that 2 moles of electrons are required to reduce 1 mole of copper ions.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of moles of electrons (n) passed through the solution:\n\nn = q / F\nwhere F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol).\n\nn = 25 C / 96,485 C/mol ≈ 0.000259 moles of electrons\n\nNow, we can find the number of moles of copper ions reduced:\n\n0.000259 moles of electrons × (1 mole of Cu²⁺ / 2 moles of electrons) ≈ 0.0001295 moles of Cu²⁺\n\nInitially, we had 0.05 M copper sulfate in 25 mL of solution. To find the initial moles of copper ions:\n\nmoles of Cu²⁺ = M × V\nwhere M is the molarity and V is the volume in liters.\n\nmoles of Cu²⁺ = 0.05 mol/L × 0.025 L = 0.00125 moles\n\nNow, we can find the new moles of copper ions after the reduction:\n\n0.00125 moles - 0.0001295 moles ≈ 0.0011205 moles\n\nFinally, we can calculate the new concentration of copper ions in the solution:\n\nNew concentration = moles of Cu²⁺ / volume in liters\nNew concentration = 0.0011205 moles / 0.025 L ≈ 0.04482 M\n\nThe concentration of copper ions in the 25 mL sample of the 0.05 M copper sulfate solution after the coulometry process is approximately 0.04482 M."
