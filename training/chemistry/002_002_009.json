    "message_2": "In Na2SO4, we have two sodium (Na) atoms, one sulfur (S) atom, and four oxygen (O) atoms. To determine the oxidation state of the sulfur atom, we need to consider the oxidation states of the other elements in the compound.\n\nSodium (Na) is an alkali metal and has an oxidation state of +1. Since there are two sodium atoms, the total oxidation state for sodium in the compound is +2.\n\nOxygen (O) typically has an oxidation state of -2. Since there are four oxygen atoms, the total oxidation state for oxygen in the compound is -8.\n\nNow, let's denote the oxidation state of sulfur as x. According to the oxidation state rules, the sum of the oxidation states of all elements in a neutral compound should be equal to zero. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n(+2) + x + (-8) = 0\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx - 6 = 0\nx = +6\n\nSo, the oxidation state of the sulfur atom in Na2SO4 is +6."
