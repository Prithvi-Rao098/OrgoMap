The heat capacity of silica gel is 0.57 J/g K.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the desorption of sodium chloride from the silica gel, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates the vapor pressure of a substance to its temperature and enthalpy change of vaporization:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nIn this case, P1 is the partial pressure of NaCl above the silica gel (0.001 atm), and P2 is the vapor pressure of NaCl at 25°C (0.0075 atm). The temperature T1 is 25°C, which is 298.15 K, and T2 is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of NaCl equals the partial pressure above the silica gel. R is the gas constant, which is 8.314 J/mol K.\n\nFirst, we need to find T2:\n\nln(0.0075/0.001) = -ΔHvap/8.314 * (1/T2 - 1/298.15)\n\n2.0149 = ΔHvap/8.314 * (1/T2 - 1/298.15)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of T2. We can rearrange the equation and solve for T2:\n\n1/T2 = 1/298.15 + 2.0149 * 8.314 / ΔHvap\n\nLet's assume that the enthalpy change of vaporization for NaCl is similar to that of water, which is approximately 40.7 kJ/mol. This is a rough assumption, but it will give us a starting point for our calculations.\n\n1/T2 = 1/298.15 + 2.0149 * 8.314 / 40700\n\n1/T2 ≈ 0.00336 + 0.000414\n\n1/T2 ≈ 0.003774\n\nT2 ≈ 265.1 K\n\nNow that we have T2, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the desorption of NaCl:\n\nΔHvap = -8.314 * (2.0149) / (1/265.1 - 1/298.15)\n\nΔHvap ≈ 40728 J/mol\n\nΔHvap ≈ 40.7 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change for the desorption of sodium chloride from the 100g sample of silica gel at 25°C is approximately 40.7 kJ/mol. Keep in mind that this value is based on the assumption that the enthalpy change of vaporization for NaCl is similar to that of water, so the actual value may be different."
