    "message_1": "What is the standard enthalpy change for the sublimation of iodine, given the following information: the standard enthalpy of fusion of solid iodine is 15.52 kJ/mol, and the standard enthalpy of vaporization of iodine is 41.91 kJ/mol?",
    "message_2": "The standard enthalpy change for the sublimation of iodine can be calculated by adding the standard enthalpy of fusion and the standard enthalpy of vaporization. This is because sublimation is the process of a substance transitioning directly from the solid phase to the gas phase, bypassing the liquid phase. In this case, the substance is iodine.\n\nStandard enthalpy change for sublimation = Standard enthalpy of fusion + Standard enthalpy of vaporization\n\nStandard enthalpy change for sublimation = 15.52 kJ/mol (fusion) + 41.91 kJ/mol (vaporization)\n\nStandard enthalpy change for sublimation = 57.43 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the sublimation of iodine is 57.43 kJ/mol."
