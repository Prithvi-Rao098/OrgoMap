    "message_2": "To calculate the bond length of a carbon-hydrogen bond in ethane, we can use the geometry of the molecule and the law of cosines. Ethane has a tetrahedral geometry around each carbon atom, with a bond angle of 109.5° between the carbon-hydrogen bonds.\n\nLet's consider a triangle formed by one carbon atom, one hydrogen atom, and the midpoint of the carbon-carbon bond. The bond angle between the carbon-hydrogen bond and the line connecting the midpoint of the carbon-carbon bond to the hydrogen atom is half of the bond angle between carbon and hydrogen, which is 109.5°/2 = 54.75°.\n\nLet C be the carbon atom, H be the hydrogen atom, and M be the midpoint of the carbon-carbon bond. We are given the distance between carbon atoms (CM) as 1.54 Å/2 = 0.77 Å (since M is the midpoint). We want to find the bond length CH.\n\nUsing the law of cosines, we have:\n\nCH^2 = CM^2 + MH^2 - 2 * CM * MH * cos(54.75°)\n\nLet x be the bond length CH, which is equal to MH. Then:\n\nx^2 = 0.77^2 + x^2 - 2 * 0.77 * x * cos(54.75°)\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx^2 - 2 * 0.77 * x * cos(54.75°) = 0.77^2\n\nx ≈ 1.09 Å\n\nSo, the bond length of a carbon-hydrogen bond in ethane is approximately 1.09 Å."
