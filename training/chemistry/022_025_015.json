    "message_1": "What is the concentration of hydrochloric acid (HCl) in a solution if 25.0 mL of the acid was titrated with a 0.10 M solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and it took 35.0 mL of the NaOH solution to reach the equivalence point?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of titration and the equation:\n\nmoles of acid = moles of base\n\nWe are given the volume and concentration of the sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution, so we can find the moles of NaOH:\n\nmoles of NaOH = volume (L) × concentration (M)\nmoles of NaOH = 0.035 L × 0.10 M\nmoles of NaOH = 0.0035 moles\n\nSince the reaction between HCl and NaOH is a 1:1 reaction, the moles of HCl will be equal to the moles of NaOH:\n\nmoles of HCl = moles of NaOH\nmoles of HCl = 0.0035 moles\n\nNow we can find the concentration of the hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution using the volume of the HCl solution and the moles of HCl:\n\nconcentration (M) = moles of HCl / volume (L)\nconcentration (M) = 0.0035 moles / 0.025 L\nconcentration (M) = 0.14 M\n\nTherefore, the concentration of the hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution is 0.14 M."
