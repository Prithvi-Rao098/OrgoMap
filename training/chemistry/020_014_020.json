    "message_1": "A chemistry student wants to determine the effect of temperature on the ionization constant (Ka) of a weak acid. The initial Ka of the acid is 1.32 × 10^-6 at 25°C. If the temperature is increased to 35°C, calculate the new value of Ka for the weak acid.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the new value of Ka for the weak acid at 35°C, we can use the Van't Hoff equation, which relates the temperature dependence of the equilibrium constant (Ka) to the enthalpy change (ΔH) of the reaction:\n\nln(Ka2/Ka1) = -ΔH/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nWhere:\nKa1 is the initial ionization constant at 25°C (1.32 × 10^-6)\nKa2 is the new ionization constant at 35°C (which we want to find)\nΔH is the enthalpy change of the reaction (assumed to be constant over the temperature range)\nR is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\nT1 is the initial temperature in Kelvin (25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K)\nT2 is the final temperature in Kelvin (35°C + 273.15 = 308.15 K)\n\nHowever, we don't have the value of ΔH. In order to solve this problem, we would need the enthalpy change of the reaction. If you can provide the enthalpy change, we can then calculate the new value of Ka for the weak acid at 35°C."
