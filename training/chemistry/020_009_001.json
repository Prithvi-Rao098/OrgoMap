    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction, we first need to determine the changes in the concentrations of the reactants and products at equilibrium.\n\nInitial concentrations:\n[H2] = 0.2 M\n[CO2] = 0.2 M\n[H2O] = 0 M\n[CO] = 0 M\n\nEquilibrium concentrations:\n[H2O] = 0.15 M\n[CO] = 0.05 M\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1 for all species, the changes in concentrations for H2 and CO2 will be equal to the change in concentration for H2O and CO.\n\nChange in [H2] = Change in [CO2] = -0.05 M (reactants decrease)\nChange in [H2O] = Change in [CO] = +0.05 M (products increase)\n\nNow, we can find the equilibrium concentrations of H2 and CO2:\n\n[H2] at equilibrium = 0.2 M - 0.05 M = 0.15 M\n[CO2] at equilibrium = 0.2 M - 0.05 M = 0.15 M\n\nNow, we can calculate the equilibrium constant (Kc) using the equilibrium concentrations:\n\nKc = ([H2O] * [CO]) / ([H2] * [CO2])\n\nKc = (0.15 M * 0.05 M) / (0.15 M * 0.15 M) = 0.0075 / 0.0225 = 1/3\n\nKc = 0.3333 (approximately)\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction at 298 K is approximately 0.3333."
