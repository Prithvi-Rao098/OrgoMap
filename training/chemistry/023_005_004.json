    "message_2": "The synthesis of ibuprofen from 2-methylpropylbenzene and carbon dioxide can be achieved through a series of reactions. Here is a step-by-step reaction mechanism:\n\n1. Friedel-Crafts Alkylation: The first step is the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of 2-methylpropylbenzene with propionyl chloride in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, such as aluminum chloride (AlCl3). This reaction forms a ketone intermediate, 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanone.\n\n2. Hydrolysis: The ketone intermediate is then hydrolyzed using a strong base, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH), to form a carboxylic acid, 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionic acid.\n\n3. Kolbe-Schmitt Reaction: The carboxylic acid is then reacted with carbon dioxide (CO2) in the presence of a strong base, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH), to form the sodium salt of ibuprofen, sodium 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionate.\n\n4. Acidification: Finally, the sodium salt of ibuprofen is acidified using a strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl), to form ibuprofen, 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionic acid.\n\nTo optimize the yield of the process, several reaction conditions can be manipulated:\n\n1. Friedel-Crafts Alkylation: The reaction should be carried out under anhydrous conditions to avoid the formation of unwanted side products. The use of excess propionyl chloride and a stoichiometric amount of the Lewis acid catalyst can also help improve the yield.\n\n2. Hydrolysis: The reaction should be carried out at a high temperature and with a large excess of the strong base to ensure complete hydrolysis of the ketone intermediate.\n\n3. Kolbe-Schmitt Reaction: The reaction should be carried out at high pressure and temperature to facilitate the reaction between the carboxylic acid and carbon dioxide. The use of a large excess of the strong base can also help improve the yield.\n\n4. Acidification: The reaction should be carried out at a low temperature and with a stoichiometric amount of the strong acid to avoid the formation of unwanted side products.\n\nOverall, careful control of reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and the amount of reactants and catalysts, can help optimize the yield of ibuprofen from 2-methylpropylbenzene and carbon dioxide."
