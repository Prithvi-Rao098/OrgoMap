    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the fusion reaction, we need to first determine the number of moles of water and then use the standard enthalpy of fusion.\n\n1. Calculate the number of moles of water:\nThe molar mass of water (H2O) is 18.015 g/mol (1.008 g/mol for hydrogen and 15.999 g/mol for oxygen).\n\nmoles of water = mass / molar mass\nmoles of water = 10.0 g / 18.015 g/mol\nmoles of water ≈ 0.555 moles\n\n2. Calculate the standard enthalpy change for the fusion reaction:\nStandard enthalpy change = moles of water × standard enthalpy of fusion\n\nStandard enthalpy change = 0.555 moles × 6.01 kJ/mol\nStandard enthalpy change ≈ 3.34 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the fusion reaction of 10.0 grams of solid water at 0°C into liquid water at 0°C is approximately 3.34 kJ."
