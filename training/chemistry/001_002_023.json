    "message_2": "Structural isomerism and stereoisomerism are two types of isomerism found in organic compounds. Isomers are molecules with the same molecular formula but different arrangements of atoms or orientation in space. Here's the difference between structural isomerism and stereoisomerism, along with examples:\n\n1. Structural Isomerism (also known as constitutional isomerism):\nIn structural isomerism, isomers have the same molecular formula but different arrangements of atoms or connectivity. This means that the atoms are bonded together in different ways, leading to different structures. Structural isomerism can be further divided into several categories, such as chain isomerism, position isomerism, and functional group isomerism.\n\nExample:\nConsider the molecular formula C4H10. It has two structural isomers:\n\na) n-Butane: CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3\nb) Isobutane (methylpropane): (CH3)3CH\n\nThese two compounds have the same molecular formula but different connectivity of atoms.\n\n2. Stereoisomerism:\nIn stereoisomerism, isomers have the same molecular formula and connectivity of atoms but different spatial arrangements or orientations. Stereoisomers can be further divided into two categories: enantiomers and diastereomers. Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, while diastereomers are not mirror images.\n\nExample:\nConsider the compound 2-butanol (C4H10O). It has two stereoisomers:\n\na) (R)-2-butanol\nb) (S)-2-butanol\n\nThese two compounds have the same molecular formula and connectivity of atoms but differ in the spatial arrangement of the hydroxyl group (-OH) and the hydrogen atom around the chiral carbon (the second carbon atom in the chain).\n\nTo distinguish between structural isomers and stereoisomers, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Compare the molecular formula of the compounds. If they are different, they are not isomers.\n2. If the molecular formula is the same, check the connectivity of atoms. If the connectivity is different, they are structural isomers.\n3. If the connectivity of atoms is the same, check the spatial arrangement of atoms or groups. If the spatial arrangement is different, they are stereoisomers.\n\nIn summary, structural isomerism involves different connectivity of atoms, while stereoisomerism involves different spatial arrangements of atoms or groups with the same connectivity."
