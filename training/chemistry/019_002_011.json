    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy of formation for acetic acid (CH3COOH), we need to manipulate the given thermochemical equations to match the formation of acetic acid from its elements in their standard states. The formation reaction for acetic acid is:\n\nC(s) + 2H2(g) + O2(g) → CH3COOH(l)\n\nFirst, we need to find the enthalpy change for the formation of one mole of H2O(l) from its elements. We can do this by dividing equation 2 by 2:\n\n1/2 * (2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(l)) => H2(g) + 1/2O2(g) → H2O(l) ΔH = -286 kJ/mol\n\nNext, we need to find the enthalpy change for the formation of one mole of C2H5OH(l) from its elements. We can do this by reversing equation 3 and dividing it by 2:\n\n1/2 * (2CO2(g) + 3H2O(l) → C2H5OH(l) + 3O2(g)) => CO2(g) + 3/2H2O(l) → C2H5OH(l) + 3/2O2(g) ΔH = 617 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can sum the enthalpy changes for the formation of CO2(g), H2O(l), and C2H5OH(l) to find the enthalpy change for the formation of CH3COOH(l):\n\nC(s) + O2(g) → CO2(g) ΔH = -394 kJ/mol\nH2(g) + 1/2O2(g) → H2O(l) ΔH = -286 kJ/mol\nCO2(g) + 3/2H2O(l) → C2H5OH(l) + 3/2O2(g) ΔH = 617 kJ/mol\n\nAdding these equations together, we get:\n\nC(s) + 2H2(g) + O2(g) → CH3COOH(l) + C2H5OH(l)\n\nNow, we need to find the enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nCH3COOH(l) + C2H5OH(l) → CH3COOH(l) + O2(g)\n\nTo do this, we can subtract the enthalpy change for the formation of C2H5OH(l) from the enthalpy change for the formation of CH3COOH(l):\n\nΔH(CH3COOH) = ΔH(CO2) + ΔH(H2O) - ΔH(C2H5OH)\nΔH(CH3COOH) = (-394 kJ/mol) + (-286 kJ/mol) - (617 kJ/mol)\nΔH(CH3COOH) = -680 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy of formation for acetic acid (CH3COOH) is -680 kJ/mol."
