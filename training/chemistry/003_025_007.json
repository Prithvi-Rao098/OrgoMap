    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction, we can use the expression:\n\nKc = [SO3]^2 / ([SO2]^2 * [O2])\n\nGiven the concentrations of the reactants and products:\n\n[SO2] = 0.10 M\n[O2] = 0.20 M\n[SO3] = 0.025 M\n\nWe can plug these values into the Kc expression:\n\nKc = (0.025)^2 / ((0.10)^2 * (0.20))\n\nKc = 0.000625 / 0.002\n\nKc = 0.3125\n\nThe equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction at 25°C is 0.3125."
