    "message_2": "A molecule with one chiral center has a three-dimensional structure where the chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different substituents. The spatial arrangement of these substituents around the chiral center gives rise to stereoisomers, specifically enantiomers.\n\nEnantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, like left and right hands. They have the same molecular formula and connectivity of atoms but differ in the spatial arrangement of the substituents around the chiral center. The relationship between enantiomers can be described using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules and assigning R or S configuration to the chiral center.\n\nTo assign R or S configuration:\n\n1. Assign priority to the four substituents around the chiral center based on their atomic number (higher atomic number gets higher priority).\n2. Arrange the molecule in a way that the lowest priority substituent (usually hydrogen) is pointing away from you.\n3. Determine the order of the remaining three substituents (1, 2, and 3) in a circular manner.\n4. If the order is clockwise, the configuration is R (rectus); if counterclockwise, the configuration is S (sinister).\n\nThe enantiomers of a molecule with one chiral center will have opposite configurations (R and S) at the chiral center. They have identical physical and chemical properties, except for their interaction with plane-polarized light and chiral environments (e.g., biological systems, chiral catalysts). One enantiomer will rotate plane-polarized light to the right (dextrorotatory, +), while the other will rotate it to the left (levorotatory, -). In chiral environments, enantiomers may exhibit different reactivity, which is crucial in pharmaceuticals and other applications where stereochemistry plays a significant role."
