    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of 1 mole of methane gas, we can use Hess's Law, which states that the total enthalpy change for a reaction is the sum of the enthalpy changes for each step in the reaction. In this case, we can use the standard enthalpies of formation for the reactants and products.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane gas is:\n\nCH4(g) + 2O2(g) -> CO2(g) + 2H2O(l)\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for this reaction (ΔH) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nΔH = Σ [standard enthalpies of formation of products] - Σ [standard enthalpies of formation of reactants]\n\nΔH = [1 mol CO2 * (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 mol H2O * (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [1 mol CH4 * (-74.8 kJ/mol) + 2 mol O2 * 0 kJ/mol]\n\nΔH = (-393.5 - 2 * 285.8) - (-74.8)\n\nΔH = (-393.5 - 571.6) + 74.8\n\nΔH = -965.1 + 74.8\n\nΔH = -890.3 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of 1 mole of methane gas under standard conditions is -890.3 kJ/mol."
