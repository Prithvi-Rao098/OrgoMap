    "message_2": "To calculate the BET surface area, we can use the following equation:\n\nBET surface area = (Amount of adsorbed gas * Molecular cross-sectional area of adsorbate) / Monolayer coverage\n\nFirst, we need to convert the amount of adsorbed gas from mmol to mol:\n\n7.2 mmol * (1 mol / 1000 mmol) = 0.0072 mol\n\nNext, we need to find the molecular cross-sectional area of nitrogen gas. The cross-sectional area of a nitrogen molecule can be estimated as 0.162 nm^2. To convert this to m^2, we can use the following conversion:\n\n0.162 nm^2 * (1 m / 1 x 10^9 nm)^2 = 0.162 x 10^-18 m^2\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the BET surface area equation:\n\nBET surface area = (0.0072 mol * 0.162 x 10^-18 m^2) / (5.8 x 10^-7 mol/m^2)\n\nBET surface area = (1.1664 x 10^-20 m^2) / (5.8 x 10^-7 m^2/mol)\n\nBET surface area = 2.011 x 10^13 m^2/mol\n\nSince we are looking for the surface area of the sample, we can multiply this value by the amount of adsorbed gas (0.0072 mol):\n\nSurface area = 2.011 x 10^13 m^2/mol * 0.0072 mol\n\nSurface area â‰ˆ 1.448 x 10^11 m^2\n\nSo, the BET surface area of the sample of carbon adsorbent is approximately 1.448 x 10^11 m^2."
