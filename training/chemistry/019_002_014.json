    "message_1": "What is the measured standard enthalpy of formation (∆H°f) of water, given that the standard enthalpy of combustion (∆H°c) of hydrogen gas is -286 kJ/mol and the standard enthalpy of combustion (∆H°c) of oxygen gas is -393.5 kJ/mol?",
    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy of formation (∆H°f) of water, we need to consider the balanced chemical equation for the formation of water from its elements:\n\nH2 (g) + 1/2 O2 (g) → H2O (l)\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation of an element in its standard state is zero. Therefore, the ∆H°f for H2 (g) and O2 (g) are both 0 kJ/mol. The standard enthalpy of combustion (∆H°c) of hydrogen gas is given as -286 kJ/mol. This value is actually the enthalpy change for the following reaction:\n\nH2 (g) + 1/2 O2 (g) → H2O (l) ; ∆H° = -286 kJ/mol\n\nSince the enthalpy change for the formation of water from its elements is the same as the enthalpy change for the combustion of hydrogen gas, the standard enthalpy of formation (∆H°f) of water is:\n\n∆H°f (H2O) = -286 kJ/mol"
