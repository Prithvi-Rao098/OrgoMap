    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG = ΔH - TΔS\n\nwhere ΔH is the change in enthalpy, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ΔS is the change in entropy.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) and standard entropy change (ΔS°) for the reaction. We can do this by using the standard enthalpies of formation and standard entropies of the substances involved in the reaction.\n\nStandard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) at 298 K:\nH2(g) = 0 kJ/mol (since it is an element in its standard state)\nO2(g) = 0 kJ/mol (since it is an element in its standard state)\nH2O(g) = -241.8 kJ/mol\n\nStandard entropies (S°) at 298 K:\nH2(g) = 130.7 J/mol·K\nO2(g) = 205.2 J/mol·K\nH2O(g) = 188.8 J/mol·K\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) and standard entropy change (ΔS°) for the reaction:\n\nΔH° = [2(-241.8 kJ/mol)] - [2(0 kJ/mol) + 0 kJ/mol] = -483.6 kJ/mol\n\nΔS° = [2(188.8 J/mol·K)] - [2(130.7 J/mol·K) + 205.2 J/mol·K] = 101.6 J/mol·K\n\nNow, we can calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) at 298 K:\n\nΔG = ΔH° - TΔS° = -483.6 kJ/mol - (298 K)(101.6 J/mol·K)(1 kJ/1000 J) ≈ -457.3 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the Gibbs free energy change for the reaction at standard conditions (298 K and 1 atm pressure) is approximately -457.3 kJ/mol."
