    "message_2": "The standard enthalpy of combustion is the amount of heat released when one mole of a substance is completely burned in oxygen under standard conditions (25°C and 1 atm pressure). In this case, we will compare the standard enthalpy of combustion of propane (C3H8) and butane (C4H10).\n\nThe balanced chemical equations for the combustion of propane and butane are:\n\nPropane:\nC3H8(g) + 5O2(g) → 3CO2(g) + 4H2O(l)\n\nButane:\nC4H10(g) + 6.5O2(g) → 4CO2(g) + 5H2O(l)\n\nTo determine the standard enthalpy of combustion for each reaction, we can use the standard enthalpies of formation (∆Hf°) for each compound involved. The standard enthalpies of formation are as follows (in kJ/mol):\n\nC3H8(g): -103.85\nC4H10(g): -126.3\nO2(g): 0\nCO2(g): -393.5\nH2O(l): -285.8\n\nUsing Hess's Law, the standard enthalpy of combustion (∆Hc°) can be calculated as the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of the products minus the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of the reactants:\n\nFor propane:\n∆Hc° = [3(-393.5) + 4(-285.8)] - [(-103.85) + 5(0)]\n∆Hc° = (-1180.5 - 1143.2) - (-103.85)\n∆Hc° = -2323.7 + 103.85\n∆Hc° = -2219.85 kJ/mol\n\nFor butane:\n∆Hc° = [4(-393.5) + 5(-285.8)] - [(-126.3) + 6.5(0)]\n∆Hc° = (-1574 - 1429) - (-126.3)\n∆Hc° = -3003 + 126.3\n∆Hc° = -2876.7 kJ/mol\n\nNow we can compare the standard enthalpy of combustion of propane and butane. The standard enthalpy of combustion of propane is -2219.85 kJ/mol, while the standard enthalpy of combustion of butane is -2876.7 kJ/mol. This means that butane releases more energy per mole when burned compared to propane under the same temperature and pressure."
