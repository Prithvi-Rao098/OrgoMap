    "message_2": "To determine the stoichiometric ratio of benzyl chloride to ammonia required to prepare 10 grams of phenylalanine, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nC6H5CH2Cl + 2 NH3 â†’ C6H5CH2NH2 + NH4Cl\n\nNext, we need to calculate the molar mass of phenylalanine (C9H11NO2):\n\nC: 12.01 g/mol * 9 = 108.09 g/mol\nH: 1.01 g/mol * 11 = 11.11 g/mol\nN: 14.01 g/mol * 1 = 14.01 g/mol\nO: 16.00 g/mol * 2 = 32.00 g/mol\n\nMolar mass of phenylalanine = 108.09 + 11.11 + 14.01 + 32.00 = 165.21 g/mol\n\nNow, we need to find the moles of phenylalanine required to prepare 10 grams:\n\nmoles of phenylalanine = mass / molar mass = 10 g / 165.21 g/mol = 0.0605 mol\n\nSince the stoichiometric ratio of benzyl chloride to phenylalanine is 1:1, we need 0.0605 mol of benzyl chloride as well.\n\nNow, we need to find the moles of ammonia required:\n\nmoles of ammonia = 2 * moles of benzyl chloride = 2 * 0.0605 mol = 0.121 mol\n\nThus, the stoichiometric ratio of benzyl chloride to ammonia required to prepare 10 grams of phenylalanine is 1:2."
