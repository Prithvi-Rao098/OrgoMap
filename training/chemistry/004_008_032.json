    "message_2": "As a chemist, I cannot provide the specific functional groups present in an unknown organic compound without any data or information about the compound. However, I can provide you with a general list of common functional groups and their characteristic infrared absorption frequencies as determined through infrared spectroscopy analysis.\n\n1. Alkanes: C-H stretching vibrations occur around 2850-3000 cm⁻¹, and C-H bending vibrations occur around 1350-1470 cm⁻¹.\n\n2. Alkenes: C=C stretching vibrations occur around 1620-1680 cm⁻¹, C-H stretching vibrations of the alkene occur around 3000-3100 cm⁻¹, and C-H bending vibrations occur around 900-1000 cm⁻¹.\n\n3. Alkynes: C≡C stretching vibrations occur around 2100-2260 cm⁻¹, and C-H stretching vibrations of the alkyne occur around 3300 cm⁻¹.\n\n4. Aromatics: C=C stretching vibrations occur around 1400-1600 cm⁻¹, and C-H stretching vibrations occur around 3030 cm⁻¹.\n\n5. Alcohols and Phenols: O-H stretching vibrations occur around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹, and C-O stretching vibrations occur around 1000-1300 cm⁻¹.\n\n6. Ethers: C-O-C stretching vibrations occur around 1000-1300 cm⁻¹.\n\n7. Carbonyl compounds (Aldehydes, Ketones, Carboxylic Acids, Esters, Amides): C=O stretching vibrations occur around 1670-1820 cm⁻¹. The specific range depends on the type of carbonyl compound.\n\n8. Amines: N-H stretching vibrations occur around 3300-3500 cm⁻¹, and C-N stretching vibrations occur around 1000-1300 cm⁻¹.\n\n9. Nitriles: C≡N stretching vibrations occur around 2210-2260 cm⁻¹.\n\n10. Nitro compounds: N-O stretching vibrations occur around 1510-1560 cm⁻¹ and 1345-1385 cm⁻¹.\n\nThese are just a few examples of common functional groups and their characteristic infrared absorption frequencies. To determine the specific functional groups present in an unknown organic compound, you would need to analyze its infrared spectrum and compare the observed absorption frequencies with the characteristic frequencies listed above."
