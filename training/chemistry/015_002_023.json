    "message_2": "The molecular geometry of CH4 (methane) is tetrahedral. In a tetrahedral arrangement, the central carbon atom is bonded to four hydrogen atoms, with each hydrogen atom occupying a vertex of a regular tetrahedron. The bond angles between the hydrogen-carbon-hydrogen atoms in methane are approximately 109.5 degrees. This geometry and bond angle can be explained by the hybridization of the carbon atom's orbitals, which is sp3 hybridization in the case of methane. Quantum chemistry calculations, such as those using the Hartree-Fock method or density functional theory, can be used to confirm these geometries and bond angles."
