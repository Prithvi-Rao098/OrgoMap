    "message_2": "The molecular geometry of a molecule with 2 bonding pairs and 2 lone pairs of electrons on its central atom is bent or angular (V-shaped). This geometry occurs because the lone pairs of electrons occupy more space and repel the bonding pairs, causing the molecule to have a bent shape."
