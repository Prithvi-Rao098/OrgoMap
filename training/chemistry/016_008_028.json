    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat energy required to change 100 grams of ice at -10°C into liquid water at 20°C, we need to consider three steps:\n\n1. Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C\n2. Melting the ice at 0°C\n3. Heating the liquid water from 0°C to 20°C\n\nStep 1: Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C\nQ1 = mass x specific heat capacity of ice x temperature change\nSpecific heat capacity of ice = 2.1 J/g°C (approximately)\nQ1 = 100 g x 2.1 J/g°C x (0 - (-10))°C = 100 x 2.1 x 10 = 2100 J\n\nStep 2: Melting the ice at 0°C\nQ2 = mass x enthalpy of fusion of ice\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of ice to moles.\nMolar mass of water = 18.015 g/mol\nMoles of ice = 100 g / 18.015 g/mol = 5.55 mol (approximately)\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat required to melt the ice.\nQ2 = 5.55 mol x 6.01 kJ/mol = 33.36 kJ = 33360 J (converted to Joules)\n\nStep 3: Heating the liquid water from 0°C to 20°C\nQ3 = mass x specific heat capacity of liquid water x temperature change\nQ3 = 100 g x 4.18 J/g°C x (20 - 0)°C = 100 x 4.18 x 20 = 8360 J\n\nNow, we can add the heat energy required for all three steps to get the total heat energy required.\nTotal heat energy = Q1 + Q2 + Q3 = 2100 J + 33360 J + 8360 J = 44,820 J\n\nSo, the amount of heat energy required to change 100 grams of ice at -10°C into liquid water at 20°C is 44,820 Joules."
