    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to first determine the amount of ethanoic acid and sodium hydroxide that will react with each other. Since sodium hydroxide is a strong base, it will react completely with the ethanoic acid, which is a weak acid.\n\nFirst, we need to find the limiting reactant. The reaction between ethanoic acid and sodium hydroxide can be represented as:\n\nCH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O\n\nThe initial moles of each reactant can be calculated as follows:\n\nmoles of CH₃COOH = 0.1 M × volume (L)\nmoles of NaOH = 0.2 M × volume (L)\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, we can determine the limiting reactant by comparing the initial moles of each reactant. Let's assume the volume of the solution is 1 L for simplicity:\n\nmoles of CH₃COOH = 0.1 mol\nmoles of NaOH = 0.2 mol\n\nSince there are fewer moles of CH₃COOH, it is the limiting reactant. The moles of CH₃COOH and NaOH that will react are:\n\nmoles of CH₃COOH reacted = 0.1 mol\nmoles of NaOH reacted = 0.1 mol\n\nAfter the reaction, the moles of each species in the solution are:\n\nmoles of CH₃COOH remaining = 0 mol\nmoles of NaOH remaining = 0.2 mol - 0.1 mol = 0.1 mol\nmoles of CH₃COONa formed = 0.1 mol\n\nSince CH₃COONa is the conjugate base of CH₃COOH, it will hydrolyze in water to produce OH⁻ ions. The hydrolysis reaction can be represented as:\n\nCH₃COONa + H₂O → CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n\nNow we can use the pKa of ethanoic acid to find the equilibrium constant (Kb) for the hydrolysis reaction:\n\npKa + pKb = 14\npKb = 14 - pKa = 14 - 4.76 = 9.24\n\nKb = 10^(-pKb) = 10^(-9.24) ≈ 5.75 × 10⁻¹⁰\n\nNext, we can set up an ICE table for the hydrolysis reaction:\n\nInitial:\n[CH₃COO⁻] = 0.1 M\n[OH⁻] = 0 M\n[CH₃COOH] = 0 M\n\nChange:\n[CH₃COO⁻] = -x\n[OH⁻] = +x\n[CH₃COOH] = +x\n\nEquilibrium:\n[CH₃COO⁻] = 0.1 - x\n[OH⁻] = x\n[CH₃COOH] = x\n\nNow we can write the expression for Kb and solve for x:\n\nKb = [OH⁻][CH₃COOH] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n5.75 × 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.1 - x)\n\nAssuming x is much smaller than 0.1, we can simplify the equation:\n\n5.75 × 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.1\nx² ≈ 5.75 × 10⁻¹¹\nx ≈ √(5.75 × 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 7.58 × 10⁻⁶\n\nSince x represents the concentration of OH⁻ ions at equilibrium, we can now calculate the pOH and pH of the solution:\n\npOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(7.58 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.12\npH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.12 ≈ 8.88\n\nTherefore, the pH of the solution that results from the reaction of 0.1 M ethanoic acid and 0.2 M sodium hydroxide at 25°C is approximately 8.88."
