    "message_1": "What is the concentration of Fe2+ ions in a solution if it takes 48.6 seconds for a current of 0.634 A to produce 0.0128 g of Fe at the cathode when an external voltage of 2.0 V is applied to the electrolysis cell with a constant of 0.15 M Fe2+?",
    "message_2": "To find the concentration of Fe2+ ions in the solution, we can use Faraday's law of electrolysis and the given information.\n\nFirst, let's find the moles of Fe produced:\n\nMolar mass of Fe = 55.85 g/mol\n0.0128 g Fe × (1 mol Fe / 55.85 g Fe) = 0.000229 mol Fe\n\nNow, let's find the number of moles of electrons (n) involved in the reduction of Fe2+ to Fe:\n\nFe2+ + 2e- → Fe\n\nSo, n = 2 moles of electrons per mole of Fe.\n\nNext, we can use Faraday's law of electrolysis:\n\nQ = n * F * moles of Fe\n\nWhere Q is the charge, n is the number of moles of electrons, F is Faraday's constant (96485 C/mol), and moles of Fe is the moles of Fe produced.\n\nWe can find the charge (Q) by multiplying the current (I) by the time (t):\n\nQ = I * t = 0.634 A * 48.6 s = 30.81 C\n\nNow, we can solve for the moles of Fe:\n\n30.81 C = 2 * 96485 C/mol * moles of Fe\nmoles of Fe = 30.81 C / (2 * 96485 C/mol) = 0.0001599 mol\n\nSince the moles of Fe produced is 0.000229 mol, and the moles of Fe2+ ions in the solution is 0.0001599 mol, we can find the concentration of Fe2+ ions:\n\n0.0001599 mol / 0.000229 mol = 0.6978\n\nNow, we can multiply this ratio by the initial concentration of Fe2+ ions (0.15 M):\n\nConcentration of Fe2+ ions = 0.6978 * 0.15 M = 0.1047 M\n\nSo, the concentration of Fe2+ ions in the solution is approximately 0.1047 M."
