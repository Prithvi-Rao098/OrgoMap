    "message_1": "A sample of radioactive material initially contains 3.2 g of a parent isotope, which undergoes a series of radioactive decay to produce a daughter isotope. If the half-life of the parent isotope is 35 days and its daughter isotope has a half-life of 7 days, what is the mass of the daughter isotope present in the sample after 140 days?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the mass of the parent isotope remaining after 140 days and then determine the mass of the daughter isotope produced.\n\nFirst, let's find the mass of the parent isotope remaining after 140 days:\n\nNumber of half-lives passed for the parent isotope = (Total time passed) / (Half-life of parent isotope) = 140 days / 35 days = 4 half-lives\n\nAfter each half-life, the mass of the parent isotope is reduced by half. So, after 4 half-lives:\n\nMass of parent isotope remaining = Initial mass * (1/2)^4 = 3.2 g * (1/16) = 0.2 g\n\nNow, let's find the mass of the daughter isotope produced. Since the initial mass of the parent isotope was 3.2 g and there are 0.2 g remaining, the mass decayed is:\n\nMass decayed = Initial mass - Mass remaining = 3.2 g - 0.2 g = 3.0 g\n\nThis decayed mass has now become the daughter isotope. However, the daughter isotope also decays with a half-life of 7 days. We need to find out how much of the daughter isotope remains after 140 days.\n\nNumber of half-lives passed for the daughter isotope = (Total time passed) / (Half-life of daughter isotope) = 140 days / 7 days = 20 half-lives\n\nMass of daughter isotope remaining = Mass decayed * (1/2)^20 = 3.0 g * (1/1048576) â‰ˆ 2.861e-6 g\n\nSo, the mass of the daughter isotope present in the sample after 140 days is approximately 2.861e-6 g."
