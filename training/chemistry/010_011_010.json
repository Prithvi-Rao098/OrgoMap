    "message_2": "To calculate the efficiency of the electrochemical cell, we need to determine the power output and the power input, and then divide the output by the input.\n\nFirst, let's find the power output (P_out). The power output can be calculated using the formula:\n\nP_out = E_cell * I\n\nwhere E_cell is the cell potential and I is the current.\n\nIn this case, E_cell = 0.60V and I = 2.5A. Therefore,\n\nP_out = 0.60V * 2.5A = 1.5W\n\nNext, let's find the power input (P_in). The power input can be calculated using the formula:\n\nP_in = (E_standard - E_loss) * I\n\nwhere E_standard is the standard potential and E_loss is the potential loss due to internal resistance.\n\nWe can calculate E_loss using Ohm's law:\n\nE_loss = I * R\n\nwhere R is the internal resistance.\n\nIn this case, I = 2.5A and R = 1.2Ω. Therefore,\n\nE_loss = 2.5A * 1.2Ω = 3.0V\n\nNow, we can calculate P_in:\n\nP_in = (0.80V - 3.0V) * 2.5A = -5.5W\n\nHowever, the power input should be positive. Since the cell potential drops to 0.60V, the actual power input should be:\n\nP_in = 0.80V * 2.5A = 2.0W\n\nFinally, we can calculate the efficiency of the electrochemical cell:\n\nEfficiency = (P_out / P_in) * 100%\n\nEfficiency = (1.5W / 2.0W) * 100% = 75%\n\nThe efficiency of the electrochemical cell is 75%."
