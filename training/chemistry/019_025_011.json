    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction between copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate and ammonia to form the deep blue complex ion Cu(NH3)4(H2O)2SO4, we need to use Hess's Law. Hess's Law states that the total enthalpy change for a reaction is the sum of the enthalpy changes for each step in the reaction.\n\nFirst, let's write down the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nCuSO4·5H2O(s) + 4NH3(aq) → Cu(NH3)4(H2O)2SO4(aq) + 3H2O(l)\n\nNow, we need to find the standard enthalpy changes for each step in the reaction. Unfortunately, the direct enthalpy change for this reaction is not readily available in standard reference materials. However, we can use the enthalpy changes of formation for the reactants and products to calculate the overall enthalpy change for the reaction.\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for a reaction (ΔH°) can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nΔH° = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔHf° is the standard enthalpy of formation for each substance.\n\nWe need to find the standard enthalpy of formation for each substance involved in the reaction:\n\n1. CuSO4·5H2O(s): -1541 kJ/mol\n2. NH3(aq): -80.29 kJ/mol\n3. Cu(NH3)4(H2O)2SO4(aq): This value is not readily available, so we will need to find a way to calculate it.\n4. H2O(l): -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nSince we don't have the standard enthalpy of formation for Cu(NH3)4(H2O)2SO4(aq) directly, we can use the enthalpy changes of other reactions involving the formation of this complex ion. One such reaction is the formation of the complex ion from CuSO4(aq) and NH3(aq):\n\nCuSO4(aq) + 4NH3(aq) → Cu(NH3)4SO4(aq)\n\nWe can find the enthalpy change for this reaction (ΔH1) from reference materials:\n\nΔH1 = -49.5 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can use this reaction and the enthalpy change for the dissolution of CuSO4·5H2O(s) in water to form CuSO4(aq) to calculate the enthalpy change for the overall reaction. The enthalpy change for the dissolution of CuSO4·5H2O(s) (ΔH2) is:\n\nΔH2 = -64.4 kJ/mol\n\nUsing Hess's Law, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the overall reaction (ΔH°):\n\nΔH° = ΔH1 + ΔH2\n\nΔH° = (-49.5 kJ/mol) + (-64.4 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH° = -113.9 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the reaction between copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate and ammonia to form the deep blue complex ion Cu(NH3)4(H2O)2SO4 is -113.9 kJ/mol."
