    "message_2": "In the molecule CH3OH (methanol), the carbon atom is bonded to three hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. To determine the hybridization of the carbon atom, we need to look at its electron configuration and the number of electron domains around it.\n\nCarbon has 4 valence electrons, and in methanol, it forms 4 sigma bonds (3 with hydrogen atoms and 1 with the oxygen atom). The number of electron domains around the carbon atom is 4, which corresponds to sp3 hybridization. Therefore, the hybridization of the carbon atom in CH3OH is sp3."
