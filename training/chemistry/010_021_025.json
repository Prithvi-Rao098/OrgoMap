    "message_2": "The corrosion potential of copper in a galvanic couple with a standard hydrogen electrode can be calculated using the Nernst equation:\n\nE = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\n\nwhere:\nE = corrosion potential\nE° = standard electrode potential\nR = gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\nT = temperature (298 K)\nn = number of electrons transferred in the redox reaction (2 for copper)\nF = Faraday's constant (96485 C/mol)\nQ = reaction quotient\n\nFor a galvanic couple with a standard hydrogen electrode, the reaction quotient (Q) is equal to 1, as the concentrations of the involved species are at their standard states.\n\nThe standard electrode potential of copper (E°) is given as +0.34 V, and the standard electrode potential of hydrogen (E°) is 0 V. Since the copper electrode is coupled with the standard hydrogen electrode, we can directly use the standard electrode potential of copper as the corrosion potential in this case:\n\nE = E°(Cu) = +0.34 V\n\nSo, the corrosion potential of copper in a galvanic couple with a standard hydrogen electrode at 298 K is +0.34 V."
