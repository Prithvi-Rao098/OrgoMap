    "message_2": "To calculate the nuclear binding energy per nucleon for a helium-4 atom, we first need to find the mass defect and then convert it into energy using Einstein's famous equation, E=mc^2. Finally, we will divide the energy by the number of nucleons (protons and neutrons) in the helium-4 atom.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the mass defect\nHelium-4 has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. The combined mass of these particles is:\n(2 * 1.00728 amu) + (2 * 1.00866 amu) = 2.01456 amu + 2.01732 amu = 4.03188 amu\n\nThe mass defect is the difference between the combined mass of the individual particles and the actual mass of the helium-4 atom:\nMass defect = 4.03188 amu - 4.00260 amu = 0.02928 amu\n\nStep 2: Convert the mass defect into energy\nFirst, we need to convert the mass defect from atomic mass units (amu) to kilograms (kg). The conversion factor is 1 amu = 1.66054 x 10^-27 kg:\n0.02928 amu * (1.66054 x 10^-27 kg/amu) = 4.859 x 10^-29 kg\n\nNow, we can use Einstein's equation, E=mc^2, to convert the mass defect into energy. The speed of light (c) is approximately 3.00 x 10^8 m/s:\nE = (4.859 x 10^-29 kg) * (3.00 x 10^8 m/s)^2 = 4.373 x 10^-12 Joules\n\nStep 3: Calculate the nuclear binding energy per nucleon\nHelium-4 has 4 nucleons (2 protons and 2 neutrons). To find the nuclear binding energy per nucleon, we divide the total binding energy by the number of nucleons:\nBinding energy per nucleon = (4.373 x 10^-12 Joules) / 4 = 1.093 x 10^-12 Joules per nucleon\n\nSo, the nuclear binding energy per nucleon for a helium-4 atom is approximately 1.093 x 10^-12 Joules per nucleon."
