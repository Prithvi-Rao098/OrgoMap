    "message_2": "A change in the reaction rate does not affect the equilibrium constant in a chemical reaction. The equilibrium constant (K) is a measure of the relative concentrations of reactants and products at equilibrium and is dependent only on the temperature and the specific reaction.\n\nThe reaction rate, on the other hand, is a measure of how quickly the reactants are converted into products (or vice versa) and can be influenced by factors such as temperature, concentration, and the presence of catalysts.\n\nWhile changes in reaction rate can influence the time it takes for a reaction to reach equilibrium, it does not change the equilibrium constant itself. The equilibrium constant remains constant for a given reaction at a specific temperature, regardless of the reaction rate."
