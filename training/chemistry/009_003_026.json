    "message_1": "A nuclear power plant uses Uranium-235 as a fuel for producing energy through the process of nuclear fission. If a sample of 1000 grams of Uranium-235 undergoes fission with an efficiency of 5%, how much energy would be produced in joules? (Given: Avogadro's number = 6.023 x 10^23, 1 atomic mass unit = 1.66 x 10^-27 kg, speed of light = 3 x 10^8 m/s, and 1 eV = 1.6 x 10^-19 J)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the energy produced, we need to first find the number of fission reactions that occur. We can do this by finding the number of Uranium-235 atoms in the 1000 gram sample.\n\n1. Calculate the number of moles of Uranium-235 in the sample:\nUranium-235 has an atomic mass of 235 g/mol. So, the number of moles in 1000 grams is:\n\nmoles = (1000 g) / (235 g/mol) = 4.2553 moles\n\n2. Calculate the number of Uranium-235 atoms in the sample:\nUsing Avogadro's number, we can find the number of atoms in the sample:\n\natoms = (4.2553 moles) * (6.023 x 10^23 atoms/mole) = 2.562 x 10^24 atoms\n\n3. Calculate the energy released per fission reaction:\nThe energy released per fission reaction of Uranium-235 is approximately 200 MeV (million electron volts). Convert this to joules:\n\nenergy_per_fission = (200 x 10^6 eV) * (1.6 x 10^-19 J/eV) = 3.2 x 10^-11 J\n\n4. Calculate the total energy released from the fission reactions:\nSince the efficiency of the fission process is 5%, only 5% of the Uranium-235 atoms will undergo fission. So, the number of fission reactions is:\n\nfission_reactions = (2.562 x 10^24 atoms) * (0.05) = 1.281 x 10^23 reactions\n\nNow, multiply the energy per fission reaction by the number of fission reactions to get the total energy released:\n\ntotal_energy = (1.281 x 10^23 reactions) * (3.2 x 10^-11 J/reaction) = 4.0992 x 10^12 J\n\nSo, the total energy produced in joules is approximately 4.0992 x 10^12 J."
