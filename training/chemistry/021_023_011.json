Provide an example of a molecule that exhibits cis-trans isomerism and outline the steps involved in determining its isomeric form.",
    "message_2": "The structural difference between cis and trans isomers in a molecule lies in the spatial arrangement of their atoms or functional groups around a double bond or a ring structure. In cis isomers, the functional groups or atoms of interest are on the same side of the double bond or ring, while in trans isomers, they are on opposite sides.\n\nSpectroscopic techniques, such as infrared (IR) spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy, can be used to determine the isomeric form of a given compound. These techniques provide information about the molecular structure, chemical environment, and bonding patterns, which can be used to differentiate between cis and trans isomers.\n\nAn example of a molecule that exhibits cis-trans isomerism is 1,2-dichloroethene (C2H2Cl2). It has two isomers: cis-1,2-dichloroethene and trans-1,2-dichloroethene.\n\nTo determine the isomeric form of 1,2-dichloroethene using spectroscopic techniques, follow these steps:\n\n1. Obtain the IR spectrum of the compound: The IR spectrum provides information about the functional groups and bond vibrations in the molecule. Cis and trans isomers often have different IR spectra due to their distinct geometries. For example, the C-Cl stretching vibrations in cis-1,2-dichloroethene appear at different wavenumbers than those in trans-1,2-dichloroethene.\n\n2. Obtain the NMR spectrum of the compound: The NMR spectrum provides information about the chemical environment of the hydrogen atoms in the molecule. In 1,2-dichloroethene, the chemical shifts of the hydrogen atoms will be different for the cis and trans isomers due to their distinct spatial arrangements. For example, the hydrogen atoms in cis-1,2-dichloroethene will have a different chemical shift than those in trans-1,2-dichloroethene.\n\n3. Analyze the Raman spectrum (if available): The Raman spectrum can provide additional information about the molecular structure and bond vibrations. Similar to the IR spectrum, the Raman spectrum of cis and trans isomers will differ due to their distinct geometries.\n\n4. Compare the obtained spectra with reference spectra: Compare the IR, NMR, and Raman spectra of the compound with reference spectra of known cis and trans isomers. Identify the characteristic peaks and patterns that differentiate the isomers and determine which isomer is present in the given compound.\n\nBy following these steps and analyzing the spectroscopic data, you can determine whether the given compound is the cis or trans isomer of 1,2-dichloroethene or any other molecule exhibiting cis-trans isomerism."
