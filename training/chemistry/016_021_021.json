    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of polymerization of styrene, we need to consider the enthalpy change for the addition of one mole of styrene and the number of monomer units involved in the polymerization.\n\nGiven:\nEnthalpy change for the addition of one mole of styrene = -32 kJ/mol\nNumber of monomer units involved in the polymerization = 50\n\nEnthalpy of polymerization = (Enthalpy change for the addition of one mole of styrene) × (Number of monomer units involved in the polymerization)\n\nEnthalpy of polymerization = (-32 kJ/mol) × (50)\n\nEnthalpy of polymerization = -1600 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy of polymerization of styrene is -1600 kJ. Since the value is negative, the reaction is exothermic, as mentioned in the problem statement."
