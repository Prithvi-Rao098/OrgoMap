    "message_2": "To find the new equilibrium concentration of [H+], we need to consider the reaction quotient (Q) and the equilibrium constant (K). The balanced chemical equation is:\n\nHCl (aq) ↔ H+ (aq) + Cl- (aq)\n\nThe initial concentrations are:\n[H+] = 0.1 M\n[Cl-] = 0 M (before adding NaCl)\n\nWhen we add 0.01 M of NaCl, the [Cl-] concentration will increase by 0.01 M. Since NaCl is a strong electrolyte, it will completely dissociate into Na+ and Cl- ions. So, the new initial concentrations are:\n[H+] = 0.1 M\n[Cl-] = 0.01 M\n\nNow, let's assume that x moles of HCl dissociate at equilibrium. The equilibrium concentrations will be:\n[H+] = 0.1 - x M\n[Cl-] = 0.01 + x M\n\nThe equilibrium constant (K) expression for the reaction is:\nK = [H+][Cl-] / [HCl]\n\nSince HCl is a strong acid, we can assume that it will completely dissociate, and the concentration of HCl at equilibrium will be negligible. Therefore, the equilibrium constant expression becomes:\n\nK = [H+][Cl-]\n\nNow, we can plug in the equilibrium concentrations and the given value of K:\n\n1.3 x 10^-4 = (0.1 - x)(0.01 + x)\n\nTo solve for x, we can first simplify the equation:\n\n1.3 x 10^-4 = 0.001 + 0.01x - x^2\n\nNow, rearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation:\n\nx^2 - 0.01x + (0.001 - 1.3 x 10^-4) = 0\n\nx^2 - 0.01x + 0.00087 = 0\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to solve for x:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nx = (0.01 ± √(0.01^2 - 4(1)(0.00087))) / 2(1)\n\nx ≈ 0.0087 and x ≈ 0.1\n\nSince x represents the change in concentration, it cannot be equal to the initial concentration of [H+]. Therefore, we will use the smaller value of x ≈ 0.0087.\n\nNow, we can find the new equilibrium concentration of [H+]:\n\n[H+] = 0.1 - x ≈ 0.1 - 0.0087 ≈ 0.0913 M\n\nSo, the new equilibrium concentration of [H+] is approximately 0.0913 M."
