    "message_2": "To calculate the power output (in Watts) of the electrochemical cell, we can use Ohm's Law and the formula for power:\n\nOhm's Law: V = IR\nPower formula: P = IV\n\nWhere V is the cell potential (1.5V), I is the current, and R is the total resistance (10 ohms).\n\nFirst, we need to find the current (I) using Ohm's Law:\n\n1.5V = I * 10 ohms\nI = 1.5V / 10 ohms\nI = 0.15A\n\nNow, we can use the power formula to find the power output:\n\nP = IV\nP = (0.15A)(1.5V)\nP = 0.225W\n\nThe power output of the electrochemical cell is 0.225 Watts."
