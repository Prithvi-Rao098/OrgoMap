    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the dissolution of 4.5 grams of NaOH in water, we first need to determine the number of moles of NaOH. The molar mass of NaOH is approximately 40 g/mol (23 g/mol for Na, 16 g/mol for O, and 1 g/mol for H).\n\nNumber of moles = (mass of NaOH) / (molar mass of NaOH)\nNumber of moles = 4.5 g / 40 g/mol = 0.1125 mol\n\nNow, we can use the molar enthalpy of dissolution to calculate the enthalpy change.\n\nEnthalpy change = (number of moles) × (molar enthalpy of dissolution)\nEnthalpy change = 0.1125 mol × (-44.5 kJ/mol) = -5.00625 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change for the dissolution of 4.5 grams of NaOH in water is approximately -5.01 kJ."
