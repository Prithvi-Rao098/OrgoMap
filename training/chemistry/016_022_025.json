    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change of isomerization for the conversion of n-butane to isobutane, we can use Hess's Law. According to Hess's Law, the enthalpy change of a reaction is the same whether it occurs in one step or several steps. In this case, we can consider the isomerization as a two-step process:\n\n1. Combustion of n-butane to form products (CO2 and H2O)\n2. Formation of isobutane from the products\n\nThe enthalpy change of isomerization (ΔH_isomerization) can be calculated as follows:\n\nΔH_isomerization = ΔH_combustion(isobutane) - ΔH_combustion(n-butane)\n\nwhere ΔH_combustion(isobutane) and ΔH_combustion(n-butane) are the heats of combustion of isobutane and n-butane, respectively.\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nΔH_isomerization = (-2878.8 kJ/mol) - (-2657.5 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH_isomerization = -221.3 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change of isomerization for the conversion of n-butane to isobutane is -221.3 kJ/mol."
