    "message_2": "To calculate the efficiency of the radiation detector, we need to determine the fraction of emitted particles that are detected by the detector. We can do this by calculating the solid angle subtended by the detector at the source and then finding the fraction of the total solid angle (4π steradians) that this represents.\n\nFirst, let's convert the area of the detector to square meters:\n10 cm² = 0.001 m²\n\nNext, we'll calculate the solid angle (Ω) subtended by the detector at the source using the formula:\n\nΩ = A / r²\n\nwhere A is the area of the detector and r is the distance from the source to the detector.\n\nΩ = 0.001 m² / (2 m)² = 0.001 m² / 4 m² = 0.00025 steradians\n\nNow, we'll find the fraction of the total solid angle (4π steradians) that this represents:\n\nFraction = Ω / (4π) = 0.00025 steradians / (4π steradians) ≈ 0.0000199\n\nFinally, we'll multiply this fraction by the activity of the source (200 Bq) to find the number of detected particles per second:\n\nDetected particles per second = 200 Bq * 0.0000199 ≈ 0.00398 Bq\n\nTo find the efficiency of the detector, we'll divide the detected particles per second by the source activity:\n\nEfficiency = (Detected particles per second) / (Source activity) = 0.00398 Bq / 200 Bq ≈ 0.0000199 or 0.00199%\n\nThe efficiency of the radiation detector is approximately 0.00199%."
