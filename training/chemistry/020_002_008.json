    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) to determine the equilibrium concentrations of the reactants and products.\n\nFor the reaction: N2O4(g) ⇌ 2NO2(g)\n\nInitial concentrations:\n[N2O4] = 0.25 M\n[NO2] = 0 M\n\nChange in concentrations:\n[N2O4] = -x\n[NO2] = +2x\n\nEquilibrium concentrations:\n[N2O4] = 0.25 - x\n[NO2] = 2x\n\nNow, we can use the equilibrium constant Kc to set up an equation:\n\nKc = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4]\n\n4.63 × 10^-3 = (2x)^2 / (0.25 - x)\n\nNow, we need to solve for x:\n\n(4.63 × 10^-3)(0.25 - x) = (2x)^2\n\n0.0011575 - 4.63 × 10^-3x = 4x^2\n\nRearrange the equation:\n\n4x^2 + 4.63 × 10^-3x - 0.0011575 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve for x using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-B ± √(B^2 - 4AC)) / 2A\n\nIn this case, A = 4, B = 4.63 × 10^-3, and C = -0.0011575\n\nx = (-(4.63 × 10^-3) ± √((4.63 × 10^-3)^2 - 4(4)(-0.0011575))) / (2(4))\n\nx = (-(4.63 × 10^-3) ± √(2.14329 × 10^-5 + 0.01848)) / 8\n\nx = (-(4.63 × 10^-3) ± √(0.0185014329)) / 8\n\nx = (-(4.63 × 10^-3) ± 0.136)) / 8\n\nThere are two possible solutions for x:\n\nx1 = (-0.00463 + 0.136) / 8 = 0.01642\nx2 = (-0.00463 - 0.136) / 8 = -0.01758\n\nSince x represents a concentration, it cannot be negative. Therefore, we will use the positive value:\n\nx = 0.01642\n\nNow, we can find the equilibrium concentration of NO2:\n\n[NO2] = 2x = 2(0.01642) = 0.03284 M\n\nSo, the equilibrium concentration of NO2(g) is 0.03284 M."
