    "message_2": "Primary, secondary, and tertiary amines are organic compounds containing nitrogen atoms with different numbers of alkyl or aryl groups attached to them. The classification is based on the number of carbon-containing groups bonded to the nitrogen atom.\n\n1. Primary amines (1° amines): Primary amines have one alkyl or aryl group attached to the nitrogen atom, with the other two bonds being hydrogen atoms. The general formula for primary amines is RNH2, where R is an alkyl or aryl group. An example of a primary amine is methylamine (CH3NH2).\n\nSynthesis: Primary amines can be synthesized by various methods, such as the reduction of nitriles (RCN) or amides (RCONH2), the nucleophilic substitution of alkyl halides (RX) with ammonia (NH3), or the Gabriel synthesis using phthalimide.\n\nReactivity with electrophiles: Primary amines are more nucleophilic and reactive towards electrophiles compared to secondary and tertiary amines due to the presence of two hydrogen atoms on the nitrogen atom, which makes it less sterically hindered and more available for reaction.\n\n2. Secondary amines (2° amines): Secondary amines have two alkyl or aryl groups attached to the nitrogen atom, with the third bond being a hydrogen atom. The general formula for secondary amines is R2NH, where R is an alkyl or aryl group. An example of a secondary amine is dimethylamine ((CH3)2NH).\n\nSynthesis: Secondary amines can be synthesized by the alkylation of primary amines (RNH2) with alkyl halides (RX) or by the reduction of imines (R2C=NR).\n\nReactivity with electrophiles: Secondary amines are less nucleophilic and reactive towards electrophiles compared to primary amines due to the presence of only one hydrogen atom on the nitrogen atom and increased steric hindrance from the two alkyl or aryl groups.\n\n3. Tertiary amines (3° amines): Tertiary amines have three alkyl or aryl groups attached to the nitrogen atom, with no hydrogen atoms bonded to it. The general formula for tertiary amines is R3N, where R is an alkyl or aryl group. An example of a tertiary amine is trimethylamine ((CH3)3N).\n\nSynthesis: Tertiary amines can be synthesized by the alkylation of secondary amines (R2NH) with alkyl halides (RX) or by the reductive amination of ketones or aldehydes with secondary amines.\n\nReactivity with electrophiles: Tertiary amines are the least nucleophilic and reactive towards electrophiles among the three types of amines due to the absence of hydrogen atoms on the nitrogen atom and increased steric hindrance from the three alkyl or aryl groups.\n\nIn summary, primary, secondary, and tertiary amines differ in their synthesis methods and reactivity towards electrophiles based on the number of alkyl or aryl groups attached to the nitrogen atom. Primary amines are the most reactive, while tertiary amines are the least reactive due to steric hindrance and the presence or absence of hydrogen atoms on the nitrogen atom."
