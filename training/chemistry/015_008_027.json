    "message_2": "The electron density and molecular orbital energies play a crucial role in determining the reactivity and selectivity of a given chemical reaction. Here's how:\n\n1. Electron density: Electron density refers to the distribution of electrons in a molecule or a region of space. It is an essential factor in understanding the reactivity of molecules in chemical reactions. Areas with high electron density are more likely to participate in reactions, as they can act as nucleophiles (electron-rich species) or stabilize electrophiles (electron-deficient species).\n\nReactivity: In general, molecules with higher electron density at the reactive site are more reactive towards electrophiles, while molecules with lower electron density are more reactive towards nucleophiles. This is because electrophiles seek electron-rich regions to form new bonds, while nucleophiles seek electron-poor regions.\n\nSelectivity: The electron density distribution in a molecule can also influence the selectivity of a reaction. If a molecule has multiple reactive sites with different electron densities, the site with the highest electron density will be more likely to react first, leading to selective reactions.\n\n2. Molecular orbital energies: Molecular orbitals are the energy states of electrons in a molecule, and their energies determine the stability of the molecule and its reactivity in chemical reactions.\n\nReactivity: The energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is called the HOMO-LUMO gap. A smaller HOMO-LUMO gap indicates that the molecule is more reactive, as it requires less energy for an electron to be transferred from the HOMO to the LUMO during a reaction. This energy difference is also related to the molecule's frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs), which are the orbitals involved in chemical reactions. Molecules with low-energy FMOs are more likely to participate in reactions.\n\nSelectivity: Molecular orbital energies can also influence the selectivity of a reaction. If a molecule has multiple reactive sites with different molecular orbital energies, the site with the most favorable energy match between the HOMO and LUMO of the reacting species will be more likely to react, leading to selective reactions.\n\nIn summary, electron density and molecular orbital energies are critical factors that determine the reactivity and selectivity of chemical reactions. High electron density and low HOMO-LUMO gaps generally lead to increased reactivity, while differences in electron density and molecular orbital energies among reactive sites can result in selective reactions."
