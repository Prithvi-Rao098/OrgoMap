    "message_2": "The VSEPR geometry of a molecule consisting of one central atom with five atoms attached to it and two lone pairs of electrons on the central atom is a square pyramidal geometry. The central atom is surrounded by five bonding pairs and two lone pairs, making a total of seven electron pairs. According to VSEPR theory, these electron pairs will arrange themselves to minimize repulsion, resulting in a square pyramidal shape."
