    "message_2": "The balanced chemical equation for the double replacement reaction between sodium chloride (NaCl) and silver nitrate (AgNO3) is:\n\nNaCl (aq) + AgNO3 (aq) â†’ NaNO3 (aq) + AgCl (s)\n\nIn this reaction, the sodium (Na+) and nitrate (NO3-) ions are the spectator ions, as they do not participate in the formation of the product and remain in the solution."
