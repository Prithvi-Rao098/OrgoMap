    "message_2": "The heat of formation (ΔHf) of a compound is the change in enthalpy during the formation of 1 mole of the substance from its constituent elements in their standard states. For methane (CH4), the reaction can be represented as:\n\nC (graphite) + 2 H2 (g) → CH4 (g)\n\nThe given enthalpy change for this reaction is -74.8 kJ/mol. Since this reaction represents the formation of 1 mole of methane from its constituent elements in their standard states, the heat of formation for methane (ΔHf°) is equal to the enthalpy change for this reaction:\n\nΔHf° (CH4) = -74.8 kJ/mol"
