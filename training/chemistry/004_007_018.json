    "message_1": "What is the mass of copper in a 5.23 g sample of a gold and copper alloy that was dissolved in nitric acid, precipitated as copper(II) hydroxide, and then converted to copper(II) oxide by heating and weighed?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to know the mass of copper(II) oxide formed and then convert it to the mass of copper.\n\nFirst, let's find the molar mass of copper(II) oxide (CuO) and copper (Cu):\n\nCuO: Cu (63.55 g/mol) + O (16.00 g/mol) = 79.55 g/mol\nCu: 63.55 g/mol\n\nNow, we need to find the mass of copper(II) oxide formed from the 5.23 g sample of the gold and copper alloy. However, the problem does not provide enough information to determine the mass of copper(II) oxide formed. \n\nAssuming we have the mass of copper(II) oxide (m_CuO), we can find the mass of copper (m_Cu) using the following equation:\n\nm_Cu = (m_CuO x M_Cu) / M_CuO\n\nwhere m_CuO is the mass of copper(II) oxide, M_Cu is the molar mass of copper, and M_CuO is the molar mass of copper(II) oxide.\n\nIf the mass of copper(II) oxide is provided, you can use this equation to find the mass of copper in the sample."
