    "message_2": "To determine the polarity of a bond between two covalently bonded atoms in a molecule, you need to consider the difference in electronegativity between the two atoms. Electronegativity is a measure of an atom's ability to attract electrons in a chemical bond. The greater the difference in electronegativity, the more polar the bond will be.\n\nIn general, if the electronegativity difference between two atoms is:\n\n1. Less than 0.5, the bond is considered nonpolar covalent.\n2. Between 0.5 and 1.7, the bond is considered polar covalent.\n3. Greater than 1.7, the bond is considered ionic (although this is a rough guideline, and there can be exceptions).\n\nNow, let's consider the example of water (H2O). Water consists of one oxygen atom covalently bonded to two hydrogen atoms. The electronegativity values for oxygen and hydrogen are 3.44 and 2.20, respectively. The difference in electronegativity between oxygen and hydrogen is:\n\n3.44 - 2.20 = 1.24\n\nSince the electronegativity difference is between 0.5 and 1.7, the bond between oxygen and hydrogen in water is considered polar covalent.\n\nWater is considered a polar molecule because of the polar covalent bonds between oxygen and hydrogen, as well as its bent molecular geometry. The oxygen atom attracts the shared electrons more strongly than the hydrogen atoms, resulting in a partial negative charge (δ-) on the oxygen atom and partial positive charges (δ+) on the hydrogen atoms. Due to the bent shape of the water molecule, these charges do not cancel each other out, leading to an overall polar molecule with a net dipole moment. This polarity is responsible for many of water's unique properties, such as its high boiling point, high heat capacity, and ability to dissolve many substances."
