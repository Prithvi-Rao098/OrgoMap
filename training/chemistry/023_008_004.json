    "message_2": "To calculate the maximum yield of p-nitroaniline, we need to use stoichiometry. First, we need to find the molar mass of aniline (C6H7N) and p-nitroaniline (C6H6N2O2).\n\nMolar mass of aniline:\nC: 12.01 g/mol x 6 = 72.06 g/mol\nH: 1.01 g/mol x 7 = 7.07 g/mol\nN: 14.01 g/mol x 1 = 14.01 g/mol\nTotal molar mass of aniline = 72.06 + 7.07 + 14.01 = 93.14 g/mol\n\nMolar mass of p-nitroaniline:\nC: 12.01 g/mol x 6 = 72.06 g/mol\nH: 1.01 g/mol x 6 = 6.06 g/mol\nN: 14.01 g/mol x 2 = 28.02 g/mol\nO: 16.00 g/mol x 2 = 32.00 g/mol\nTotal molar mass of p-nitroaniline = 72.06 + 6.06 + 28.02 + 32.00 = 138.14 g/mol\n\nNow, we can use stoichiometry to find the maximum yield of p-nitroaniline. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nC6H7N + HNO3 → C6H6N2O2 + H2O\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of aniline reacts with 1 mole of nitric acid to produce 1 mole of p-nitroaniline.\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of aniline:\n50 g aniline × (1 mol aniline / 93.14 g aniline) = 0.536 moles of aniline\n\nSince the reaction goes to completion and there is an excess of nitric acid, all of the aniline will be converted to p-nitroaniline. Therefore, we can find the mass of p-nitroaniline produced:\n\n0.536 moles of aniline × (1 mol p-nitroaniline / 1 mol aniline) × (138.14 g p-nitroaniline / 1 mol p-nitroaniline) = 74.08 g of p-nitroaniline\n\nSo, the maximum yield of p-nitroaniline that can be obtained when 50g of aniline is reacted with an excess of nitric acid is 74.08 g."
