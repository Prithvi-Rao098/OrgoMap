    "message_2": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast cancer that lacks the expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). This makes it more challenging to treat, as it does not respond to hormonal therapies or HER2-targeted treatments. To develop drugs that specifically target TNBC cells while minimizing toxicity to healthy cells, several chemical modifications can be considered:\n\n1. Conjugation with targeting ligands: Attaching specific targeting ligands, such as peptides, antibodies, or aptamers, to existing cancer drugs can enhance their selectivity towards TNBC cells. These ligands can bind to receptors or antigens that are overexpressed on the surface of TNBC cells, allowing for targeted drug delivery and reduced toxicity to healthy cells.\n\n2. Prodrug strategies: Designing prodrugs that are selectively activated in the tumor microenvironment can minimize toxicity to healthy cells. For example, prodrugs can be designed to be activated by enzymes or conditions (e.g., low pH) that are specifically present in the tumor microenvironment, ensuring that the active drug is released primarily in the vicinity of cancer cells.\n\n3. Nanoparticle-based drug delivery: Encapsulating existing cancer drugs within nanoparticles can improve their targeting and reduce toxicity. Nanoparticles can be functionalized with targeting ligands to enhance their specificity for TNBC cells, and their size and surface properties can be optimized to improve their biodistribution and pharmacokinetics.\n\n4. Combination therapies: Combining existing cancer drugs with other targeted therapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors or angiogenesis inhibitors, can enhance their efficacy against TNBC cells while minimizing toxicity. This approach can exploit synergistic effects between the drugs and may allow for lower doses to be used, reducing side effects.\n\n5. Structure-based drug design: Using computational methods and structural information about the target proteins, existing cancer drugs can be chemically modified to improve their binding affinity and selectivity for specific targets in TNBC cells. This can lead to the development of more potent and selective inhibitors with reduced off-target effects and toxicity.\n\nIn summary, several chemical modifications can be made to existing cancer drugs to improve their targeting and efficacy against triple-negative breast cancer cells while minimizing toxicity to healthy cells. These strategies include conjugation with targeting ligands, prodrug design, nanoparticle-based drug delivery, combination therapies, and structure-based drug design."
