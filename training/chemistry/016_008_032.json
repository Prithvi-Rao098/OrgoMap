    "message_2": "To find the amount of heat energy absorbed/released, we need to consider three steps:\n\n1. Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C (its melting point)\n2. Melting the ice at 0°C\n3. Heating the melted water from 0°C to 60°C\n\nStep 1: Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C\nWe need to use the specific heat capacity of ice, which is approximately 2.093 J/g°C.\n\nq1 = mass x specific heat capacity of ice x temperature change\nq1 = 50 g x 2.093 J/g°C x (0°C - (-10°C))\nq1 = 50 g x 2.093 J/g°C x 10°C\nq1 = 1046.5 J\n\nStep 2: Melting the ice at 0°C\nWe need to use the enthalpy of fusion for ice, which is 333.7 J/g.\n\nq2 = mass x enthalpy of fusion\nq2 = 50 g x 333.7 J/g\nq2 = 16685 J\n\nStep 3: Heating the melted water from 0°C to 60°C\nWe need to use the specific heat capacity of water, which is 4.184 J/g°C.\n\nq3 = mass x specific heat capacity of water x temperature change\nq3 = 50 g x 4.184 J/g°C x (60°C - 0°C)\nq3 = 50 g x 4.184 J/g°C x 60°C\nq3 = 12552 J\n\nNow, we add up the heat energy absorbed/released in each step:\n\nTotal heat energy = q1 + q2 + q3\nTotal heat energy = 1046.5 J + 16685 J + 12552 J\nTotal heat energy = 30283.5 J\n\nSo, the amount of heat energy absorbed/released when 50 grams of ice at -10°C is melted and heated to 60°C is 30,283.5 J."
