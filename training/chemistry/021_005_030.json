    "message_2": "The polarity of a bond between carbon and oxygen in carbon dioxide (CO2) can be determined by looking at the electronegativity difference between the two atoms. Electronegativity is a measure of an atom's ability to attract electrons in a covalent bond.\n\nCarbon has an electronegativity value of 2.55, while oxygen has a higher electronegativity value of 3.44. The difference between these two values is 0.89, which indicates that the bond between carbon and oxygen is polar. In a polar bond, electrons are shared unequally between the two atoms, with the more electronegative atom (in this case, oxygen) attracting the electrons more strongly.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that while the individual C-O bonds in CO2 are polar, the overall molecule is nonpolar. This is because CO2 has a linear molecular geometry, with the two oxygen atoms symmetrically located on either side of the carbon atom. The polarities of the two C-O bonds cancel each other out, resulting in a nonpolar molecule."
