    "message_2": "In carbon dioxide (CO2), there are two carbon-oxygen double bonds. To calculate the bond enthalpy for the carbon-oxygen bond in CO2, we can use the given bond enthalpy values for the carbon-oxygen double bond and single bond.\n\nSince there are two carbon-oxygen double bonds in CO2, we can calculate the total bond enthalpy for CO2 as follows:\n\nTotal bond enthalpy for CO2 = 2 * (Bond enthalpy of carbon-oxygen double bond)\nTotal bond enthalpy for CO2 = 2 * (799 kJ/mol)\nTotal bond enthalpy for CO2 = 1598 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can find the average bond enthalpy for a single carbon-oxygen bond in CO2 by dividing the total bond enthalpy by the number of carbon-oxygen bonds:\n\nAverage bond enthalpy for a single carbon-oxygen bond in CO2 = (Total bond enthalpy for CO2) / (Number of carbon-oxygen bonds)\nAverage bond enthalpy for a single carbon-oxygen bond in CO2 = (1598 kJ/mol) / 2\nAverage bond enthalpy for a single carbon-oxygen bond in CO2 = 799 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the bond enthalpy for the carbon-oxygen bond in carbon dioxide (CO2) is 799 kJ/mol."
