    "message_2": "To determine the percentage composition of the mixture containing benzene, toluene, and xylene, we can simply use the peak areas obtained from the gas chromatography analysis as a representation of their relative amounts in the mixture.\n\nThe total peak area is the sum of the individual peak areas:\n\nTotal peak area = Benzene peak area + Toluene peak area + Xylene peak area\nTotal peak area = 28% + 42% + 30% = 100%\n\nNow, we can calculate the percentage composition of each component in the mixture:\n\nBenzene percentage composition = (Benzene peak area / Total peak area) × 100\nBenzene percentage composition = (28% / 100%) × 100 = 28%\n\nToluene percentage composition = (Toluene peak area / Total peak area) × 100\nToluene percentage composition = (42% / 100%) × 100 = 42%\n\nXylene percentage composition = (Xylene peak area / Total peak area) × 100\nXylene percentage composition = (30% / 100%) × 100 = 30%\n\nSo, the percentage composition of the mixture is 28% benzene, 42% toluene, and 30% xylene."
