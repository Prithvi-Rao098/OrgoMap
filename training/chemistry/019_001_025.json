    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of methane gas, we need to consider the balanced chemical equation for the combustion reaction:\n\nCH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l)\n\nNext, we need to find the standard enthalpies of formation for all the reactants and products involved in the reaction. We are given the standard enthalpies of formation for CH4(g) and H2O(l), but we also need the values for O2(g) and CO2(g). The standard enthalpy of formation for O2(g) is 0 kJ/mol (since it is in its elemental form), and the standard enthalpy of formation for CO2(g) is -393.5 kJ/mol.\n\nNow we can use Hess's Law to calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nΔH = Σ [ΔHf(products)] - Σ [ΔHf(reactants)]\n\nΔH = [1 × (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 × (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [1 × (-74.8 kJ/mol) + 2 × 0 kJ/mol]\n\nΔH = (-393.5 - 571.6 + 74.8) kJ/mol\n\nΔH = -890.3 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change for the combustion of methane gas is -890.3 kJ/mol."
