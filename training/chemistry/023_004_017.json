    "message_2": "To calculate the theoretical yield of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), we need to first determine the limiting reagent in the reaction. The balanced chemical equation for the synthesis of aspirin is:\n\nC7H6O3 (salicylic acid) + C4H6O3 (acetic anhydride) → C9H8O4 (aspirin) + C2H4O2 (acetic acid)\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of each reactant:\nMoles = mass (g) / molar mass (g/mol)\n\nThe molar mass of salicylic acid (C7H6O3) is 138.12 g/mol, and the molar mass of acetic anhydride (C4H6O3) is 102.09 g/mol.\n\nMoles of salicylic acid = 5 g / 138.12 g/mol = 0.0362 mol\nMoles of acetic anhydride = 10 g / 102.09 g/mol = 0.0979 mol\n\nNow, we need to determine the limiting reagent by comparing the mole ratio of the reactants:\n\nMole ratio = moles of salicylic acid / moles of acetic anhydride = 0.0362 mol / 0.0979 mol = 0.369\n\nSince the mole ratio is less than 1, salicylic acid is the limiting reagent.\n\nNow, we can calculate the theoretical yield of aspirin (C9H8O4) using the stoichiometry of the balanced equation:\n\nMoles of aspirin = moles of salicylic acid = 0.0362 mol\n\nThe molar mass of aspirin is 180.16 g/mol.\n\nMass of aspirin = moles of aspirin × molar mass of aspirin = 0.0362 mol × 180.16 g/mol = 6.52 g\n\nTherefore, the theoretical yield of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) that can be obtained from 5 grams of salicylic acid and 10 grams of acetic anhydride is 6.52 grams, assuming a 100% conversion rate and perfect reaction conditions."
