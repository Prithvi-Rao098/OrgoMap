    "message_1": "In the electrochemical reaction between zinc and copper ions, a current of 2.5 A is passed through the cell for 5 minutes. If the mass of zinc electrode decreases by 1.25 g, determine the number of electrons transferred in the reaction. (Assume the efficiency of the cell is 100% and the atomic weight of zinc is 65.38 g/mol)",
    "message_2": "First, we need to determine the amount of charge passed through the cell. We can do this by multiplying the current (2.5 A) by the time (5 minutes or 300 seconds).\n\nCharge (Q) = Current (I) × Time (t)\nQ = 2.5 A × 300 s\nQ = 750 Coulombs\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of moles of zinc that have reacted. We can do this by dividing the mass of zinc (1.25 g) by its atomic weight (65.38 g/mol).\n\nMoles of zinc (n) = Mass of zinc (m) / Atomic weight of zinc (M)\nn = 1.25 g / 65.38 g/mol\nn ≈ 0.0191 mol\n\nIn the electrochemical reaction, each zinc atom loses 2 electrons as it forms a Zn2+ ion:\n\nZn(s) → Zn2+(aq) + 2e-\n\nSo, for each mole of zinc, 2 moles of electrons are transferred. Therefore, we can determine the total moles of electrons transferred in the reaction:\n\nMoles of electrons = Moles of zinc × 2\nMoles of electrons ≈ 0.0191 mol × 2\nMoles of electrons ≈ 0.0382 mol\n\nNow, we can determine the number of electrons transferred by multiplying the moles of electrons by Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23 electrons/mol):\n\nNumber of electrons = Moles of electrons × Avogadro's number\nNumber of electrons ≈ 0.0382 mol × 6.022 x 10^23 electrons/mol\nNumber of electrons ≈ 2.3 x 10^22 electrons\n\nSo, approximately 2.3 x 10^22 electrons are transferred in the reaction."
