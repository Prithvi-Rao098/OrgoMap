    "message_1": "Given the following unbalanced chemical equation: Fe + HCl → FeCl3 + H2, what is the balanced equation for the reaction and how many moles of hydrogen gas will be formed when 0.25 moles of Fe react with an excess of HCl?",
    "message_2": "To balance the chemical equation, we need to make sure that the number of atoms of each element on both sides of the equation is equal. The balanced equation is:\n\nFe + 6HCl → FeCl3 + 3H2\n\nNow, we can determine how many moles of hydrogen gas (H2) will be formed when 0.25 moles of Fe react with an excess of HCl. According to the balanced equation, 1 mole of Fe reacts to produce 3 moles of H2. So, we can set up a proportion:\n\n1 mole Fe / 3 moles H2 = 0.25 moles Fe / x moles H2\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx moles H2 = (0.25 moles Fe * 3 moles H2) / 1 mole Fe\nx moles H2 = 0.75 moles H2\n\nTherefore, 0.75 moles of hydrogen gas will be formed when 0.25 moles of Fe react with an excess of HCl."
