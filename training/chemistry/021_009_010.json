    "message_2": "According to the molecular orbital theory, the bond order of a molecule can be calculated using the formula:\n\nBond order = (Number of electrons in bonding orbitals - Number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\n\nFor the O2 molecule, there are 12 valence electrons (6 from each oxygen atom). The molecular orbital configuration for O2 is:\n\n1σ², 1σ*², 2σ², 2σ*², 1π², 1π²\n\nHere, the bonding orbitals are 1σ², 2σ², 1π², and 1π², which contain a total of 8 electrons. The antibonding orbitals are 1σ*² and 2σ*², which contain a total of 4 electrons.\n\nUsing the bond order formula:\n\nBond order = (8 - 4) / 2 = 2\n\nSo, the bond order of the O2 molecule is 2.\n\nRegarding its paramagnetic or diamagnetic properties, a molecule is considered paramagnetic if it has unpaired electrons and diamagnetic if all electrons are paired.\n\nIn the O2 molecular orbital configuration, there are two unpaired electrons in the 1π orbitals. Therefore, the O2 molecule is paramagnetic."
