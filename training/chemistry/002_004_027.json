    "message_1": "What is the pH of a solution obtained by mixing 50 mL of 0.1 M NaOH with 50 mL of 0.05 M HCl? (Assume the temperature is constant and the volumes are additive.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to first determine the moles of NaOH and HCl in the solution, and then find the resulting concentration of the remaining ions after the reaction.\n\n1. Calculate the moles of NaOH and HCl:\nMoles of NaOH = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 M × 0.05 L = 0.005 moles\nMoles of HCl = Molarity × Volume = 0.05 M × 0.05 L = 0.0025 moles\n\n2. Determine the moles of the remaining ions after the reaction:\nNaOH and HCl react in a 1:1 ratio, so the limiting reactant is HCl.\nMoles of remaining NaOH = Moles of NaOH - Moles of HCl = 0.005 - 0.0025 = 0.0025 moles\n\n3. Calculate the concentration of the remaining ions:\nTotal volume of the solution = Volume of NaOH + Volume of HCl = 50 mL + 50 mL = 100 mL = 0.1 L\nConcentration of remaining NaOH = Moles of remaining NaOH / Total volume = 0.0025 moles / 0.1 L = 0.025 M\n\n4. Calculate the pH of the solution:\nSince NaOH is a strong base, the concentration of OH- ions in the solution is equal to the concentration of the remaining NaOH. To find the pH, we first need to find the pOH.\npOH = -log10[OH-] = -log10(0.025) ≈ 1.60\n\nNow, we can use the relationship between pH and pOH:\npH + pOH = 14\npH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.60 ≈ 12.40\n\nThe pH of the solution obtained by mixing 50 mL of 0.1 M NaOH with 50 mL of 0.05 M HCl is approximately 12.40."
