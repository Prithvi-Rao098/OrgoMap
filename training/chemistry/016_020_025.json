    "message_2": "The enthalpy change when solid sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is dissolved into water can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nΔH_solution = ΔH_desorption + ΔH_hydration\n\nWhere ΔH_solution is the molar heat of solution, ΔH_desorption is the desorption enthalpy of NaOH, and ΔH_hydration is the enthalpy change associated with the hydration of the ions.\n\nGiven that the molar heat of solution (ΔH_solution) is -44.51 kJ/mol and the desorption enthalpy (ΔH_desorption) is 44.51 kJ/mol, we can rearrange the equation to solve for ΔH_hydration:\n\nΔH_hydration = ΔH_solution - ΔH_desorption\n\nΔH_hydration = -44.51 kJ/mol - 44.51 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_hydration = -89.02 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy change when solid sodium hydroxide is dissolved into water is -89.02 kJ/mol."
