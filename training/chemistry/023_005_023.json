    "message_2": "The synthesis of ibuprofen from 2-methylpropylbenzene (isobutylbenzene) and carbon dioxide typically involves a two-step process: Friedel-Crafts acylation and subsequent carboxylation.\n\n1. Friedel-Crafts Acylation: In this step, 2-methylpropylbenzene reacts with acetyl chloride in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, such as aluminum chloride (AlCl3), to form 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanoyl chloride.\n\nOptimal conditions for this reaction include:\n- Temperature: 0 to 25°C (preferably around 0°C to minimize side reactions)\n- Molar ratio: Excess acetyl chloride and aluminum chloride to ensure complete reaction\n- Solvent: Anhydrous conditions using a non-polar solvent like dichloromethane or chloroform\n\n2. Carboxylation: In this step, 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanoyl chloride reacts with carbon dioxide (CO2) to form ibuprofen.\n\nOptimal conditions for this reaction include:\n- Temperature: 100 to 150°C (to facilitate the reaction)\n- Pressure: High pressure (10-30 atm) to increase the solubility of CO2 in the reaction mixture\n- Base: A strong base like sodium or potassium hydroxide to facilitate the reaction\n- Solvent: Polar aprotic solvents like dimethylformamide (DMF) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)\n\nThe yield and purity of the final product (ibuprofen) are affected by the reaction conditions in the following ways:\n\n- Temperature: Maintaining optimal temperatures in both steps ensures that the reactions proceed efficiently and minimizes side reactions that can reduce yield and purity.\n- Molar ratio: Using excess reactants and catalysts helps drive the reactions to completion, increasing the yield of the desired product.\n- Pressure: High pressure in the carboxylation step increases the solubility of CO2, promoting the formation of ibuprofen and improving yield.\n- Solvent: Choosing appropriate solvents for each step ensures that the reactants and intermediates are soluble, facilitating the reactions and improving yield and purity.\n\nAfter the synthesis, purification steps such as recrystallization or chromatography can be employed to further improve the purity of the final ibuprofen product."
