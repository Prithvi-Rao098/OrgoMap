    "message_2": "To determine the identities of the radioactive isotopes present in the sample, we can look up known gamma-ray energies for various isotopes and match them to the energies observed in the sample.\n\n1. The 511 keV peak is a common energy associated with the annihilation of an electron and a positron. This process occurs when a positron-emitting isotope undergoes beta-plus decay. One such isotope is Fluorine-18 (18F), which is commonly used in medical imaging (PET scans). However, there are other positron-emitting isotopes as well, so we need to consider the second peak to narrow down the possibilities.\n\n2. The 1.275 MeV peak can be matched to the gamma-ray energy emitted by the decay of Sodium-22 (22Na). Sodium-22 undergoes beta-plus decay and emits a gamma-ray with an energy of 1.275 MeV. This matches the second peak in the gamma spectrum.\n\nConsidering both peaks, it is likely that the sample contains a mixture of Fluorine-18 and Sodium-22 isotopes. The 511 keV peak is due to the annihilation of positrons emitted during the decay of both isotopes, while the 1.275 MeV peak is specifically due to the gamma-ray emission from Sodium-22 decay."
