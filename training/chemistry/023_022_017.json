    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to first determine the balanced chemical equation for the reaction and then use stoichiometry to calculate the required amount of nitric acid.\n\nThe reaction involves the nitration of benzoic acid to form 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nC6H5COOH + 2 HNO3 → C6H3(NO2)2COOH + 2 H2O\n\nNow, we need to use stoichiometry to determine the amount of nitric acid (HNO3) required to prepare 10 grams of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid (C6H3(NO2)2COOH).\n\n1. Calculate the molar mass of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid:\nC6H3(NO2)2COOH = (6 × 12.01) + (3 × 1.01) + (4 × 14.01) + (2 × 16.00) + (1 × 12.01) + (1 × 16.00) + (1 × 1.01) = 213.14 g/mol\n\n2. Calculate the moles of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid:\nmoles = mass / molar mass = 10 g / 213.14 g/mol = 0.0469 mol\n\n3. Use the stoichiometry of the balanced chemical equation:\n2 moles of HNO3 are required for 1 mole of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid.\nSo, 0.0469 mol of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid will require 0.0469 × 2 = 0.0938 mol of HNO3.\n\n4. Calculate the mass of nitric acid required:\nMolar mass of HNO3 = (1 × 1.01) + (1 × 14.01) + (3 × 16.00) = 63.02 g/mol\nmass = moles × molar mass = 0.0938 mol × 63.02 g/mol = 5.91 g\n\nTherefore, 5.91 grams of nitric acid are required to prepare 10 grams of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid from benzoic acid."
