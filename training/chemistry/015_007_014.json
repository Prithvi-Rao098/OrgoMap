    "message_2": "First, we need to find the energy difference between the two energy levels (n=3 and n=2). We can do this by calculating the energy for each level and then finding the difference.\n\nE3 = -13.6 / (3^2) eV = -13.6 / 9 eV = -1.51 eV\nE2 = -13.6 / (2^2) eV = -13.6 / 4 eV = -3.4 eV\n\nNow, we can find the energy difference (ΔE) between the two levels:\n\nΔE = E2 - E3 = -3.4 eV - (-1.51 eV) = -1.89 eV\n\nNext, we need to convert this energy difference from electron volts (eV) to joules (J). We can do this using the conversion factor: 1 eV = 1.602 × 10^-19 J.\n\nΔE = -1.89 eV × (1.602 × 10^-19 J/eV) = -3.03 × 10^-19 J\n\nNow, we can use the Planck's equation to find the wavelength (λ) of light that must be absorbed for this transition:\n\nE = h × c / λ\n\nWhere E is the energy difference, h is the Planck constant (6.626 × 10^-34 J s), and c is the speed of light (3 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for λ:\n\nλ = h × c / E\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nλ = (6.626 × 10^-34 J s) × (3 × 10^8 m/s) / (-3.03 × 10^-19 J)\n\nλ = 6.56 × 10^-7 m\n\nTherefore, the wavelength of light that must be absorbed for an electron in a hydrogen atom to transition from the n=3 to n=2 energy level is approximately 6.56 × 10^-7 m or 656 nm."
