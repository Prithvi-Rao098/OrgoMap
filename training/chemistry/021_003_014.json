    "message_1": "What is the predicted bond angle in a molecule of water (H2O) based on its molecular geometry?",
    "message_2": "The molecular geometry of a water molecule (H2O) is bent or V-shaped. This is because the central oxygen atom has two lone pairs of electrons and two bonded pairs of electrons (with the two hydrogen atoms). The electron pairs repel each other, causing the molecule to have a bent geometry. The predicted bond angle in a water molecule is approximately 104.5 degrees."
