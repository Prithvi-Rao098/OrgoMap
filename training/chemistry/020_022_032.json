    "message_1": "What is the new equilibrium constant of the redox reaction between Fe2+ and Ce4+ if the initial concentration of Fe2+ is 0.1 M and the initial concentration of Ce4+ is 0.15 M, but the concentration of Fe2+ is decreased to 0.05 M and the concentration of Ce4+ is increased to 0.2 M at equilibrium?",
    "message_2": "To find the new equilibrium constant, we need to first write the balanced redox reaction between Fe2+ and Ce4+. The balanced redox reaction is:\n\nFe2+ + Ce4+ â†’ Fe3+ + Ce3+\n\nNow, let's use the reaction quotient (Q) formula to find the new equilibrium constant (K):\n\nQ = [Fe3+][Ce3+] / [Fe2+][Ce4+]\n\nSince the concentration of Fe2+ decreased from 0.1 M to 0.05 M, the change in concentration is 0.05 M. Similarly, the concentration of Ce4+ increased from 0.15 M to 0.2 M, so the change in concentration is 0.05 M. We can assume that the change in concentration of Fe3+ and Ce3+ is also 0.05 M.\n\nAt equilibrium, the concentrations are:\n\n[Fe2+] = 0.05 M\n[Ce4+] = 0.2 M\n[Fe3+] = 0.05 M (initially 0, increased by 0.05 M)\n[Ce3+] = 0.05 M (initially 0, increased by 0.05 M)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Q formula:\n\nQ = (0.05)(0.05) / (0.05)(0.2) = 0.0025 / 0.01 = 0.25\n\nSince Q = K at equilibrium, the new equilibrium constant (K) is 0.25."
