    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (K) for the given redox reaction, we first need to determine the concentrations of all species at equilibrium. Since Cu is in excess, we don't need to consider its concentration. \n\nInitial concentrations:\n[Fe2+] = 0.10 M\n[Fe3+] = 0 M (assuming no Fe3+ initially)\n[Cu2+] = 0 M (assuming no Cu2+ initially)\n\nAt equilibrium, some amount of Fe2+ has reacted to form Fe3+. The final concentration of Fe3+ is given as 0.029 M. Therefore, the change in concentration of Fe2+ and Fe3+ is:\n\nΔ[Fe2+] = -0.029 M\nΔ[Fe3+] = +0.029 M\n\nNow, we can find the equilibrium concentrations of Fe2+ and Fe3+:\n\n[Fe2+]_eq = 0.10 M - 0.029 M = 0.071 M\n[Fe3+]_eq = 0 M + 0.029 M = 0.029 M\n\nSince Cu is in excess, the concentration of Cu2+ at equilibrium will be equal to the concentration of Fe3+:\n\n[Cu2+]_eq = 0.029 M\n\nNow we can write the expression for the equilibrium constant (K):\n\nK = [Fe3+][Cu2+] / [Fe2+]\n\nSubstitute the equilibrium concentrations:\n\nK = (0.029 M)(0.029 M) / (0.071 M) = 0.000841 / 0.071 ≈ 0.0118\n\nThe equilibrium constant for the given redox reaction at 25°C is approximately 0.0118."
