    "message_2": "The solubility of Calcium Sulfate (CaSO4) in water at 25°C is approximately 2.4 grams per liter (g/L).\n\nSeveral factors influence the solubility of CaSO4 in water:\n\n1. Temperature: The solubility of CaSO4 generally increases with increasing temperature. However, the relationship between solubility and temperature is not linear, and the solubility may decrease at very high temperatures.\n\n2. Presence of other ions: The solubility of CaSO4 can be affected by the presence of other ions in the solution. For example, the presence of common ions like Ca2+ or SO42- can decrease the solubility of CaSO4 due to the common ion effect. Conversely, the presence of ions that can form complexes with Ca2+ or SO42- may increase the solubility of CaSO4.\n\n3. pH: The solubility of CaSO4 can be influenced by the pH of the solution. In acidic conditions, the solubility of CaSO4 may increase due to the formation of calcium-bisulfate complexes. In alkaline conditions, the solubility of CaSO4 may decrease due to the precipitation of calcium carbonate.\n\n4. Pressure: The solubility of CaSO4 is not significantly affected by pressure, as it is a solid and does not undergo significant volume changes upon dissolution."
