    "message_1": "What is the Gibbs free energy change for the following electrochemical reaction at standard conditions: \n\nZn(s) + Cu2+(aq) → Cu(s) + Zn2+(aq) \n\nGiven: \n\nStandard reduction potentials: \n\nCu2+(aq) + 2e- → Cu(s) E°red = +0.34 V \nZn2+(aq) + 2e- → Zn(s) E°red = -0.76 V",
    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) for the given electrochemical reaction, we first need to determine the overall cell potential (E°cell) for the reaction. This can be done using the standard reduction potentials provided.\n\nSince Zn(s) is being oxidized to Zn2+(aq) in the reaction, we need to reverse the Zn2+(aq) + 2e- → Zn(s) reaction to obtain the oxidation half-reaction:\n\nZn(s) → Zn2+(aq) + 2e- \n\nThe standard oxidation potential (E°ox) for this reaction is the negative of the standard reduction potential:\n\nE°ox = -E°red = -(-0.76 V) = +0.76 V\n\nNow, we can calculate the overall cell potential (E°cell) by adding the standard reduction potential of Cu2+(aq) and the standard oxidation potential of Zn(s):\n\nE°cell = E°red(Cu2+) + E°ox(Zn) = +0.34 V + 0.76 V = +1.10 V\n\nNext, we can use the relationship between Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°), the number of moles of electrons transferred (n), the Faraday constant (F = 96,485 C/mol), and the cell potential (E°cell):\n\nΔG° = -nFE°cell\n\nIn this reaction, 2 moles of electrons are transferred (from Zn to Cu2+). Therefore, n = 2. Now we can calculate ΔG°:\n\nΔG° = -2 mol × 96,485 C/mol × 1.10 V = -212,667 J/mol\n\nSince the value is usually expressed in kJ/mol, we can convert it:\n\nΔG° = -212,667 J/mol × (1 kJ/1000 J) = -212.67 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the Gibbs free energy change for the given electrochemical reaction at standard conditions is -212.67 kJ/mol."
