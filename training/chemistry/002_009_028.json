    "message_2": "To find the empirical formula, we need to determine the mole ratio of carbon and chlorine in the compound. \n\n1. Convert the percentages to grams (assuming we have 100g of the compound):\n- 58.8 g of chlorine\n- 41.2 g of carbon\n\n2. Convert grams to moles:\n- Moles of chlorine = 58.8 g / (35.45 g/mol) ≈ 1.66 moles\n- Moles of carbon = 41.2 g / (12.01 g/mol) ≈ 3.43 moles\n\n3. Divide both values by the smallest number of moles to get the mole ratio:\n- Mole ratio of chlorine = 1.66 / 1.66 = 1\n- Mole ratio of carbon = 3.43 / 1.66 ≈ 2\n\nSo, the empirical formula is C2Cl. \n\nNow, we need to find the molecular formula using the molar mass of the compound (98 g/mol).\n\n4. Calculate the molar mass of the empirical formula:\n- Molar mass of C2Cl = (2 * 12.01 g/mol) + (1 * 35.45 g/mol) = 59.47 g/mol\n\n5. Divide the molar mass of the compound by the molar mass of the empirical formula to find the ratio (n):\n- n = 98 g/mol / 59.47 g/mol ≈ 1.65\n\nSince the ratio is close to 2, we can assume that the molecular formula is twice the empirical formula.\n\n6. Multiply the empirical formula by the ratio (n):\n- Molecular formula = 2 * C2Cl = C4Cl2\n\nTherefore, the molecular formula of the inorganic compound is C4Cl2."
