    "message_2": "Diethyl ether (C4H10O) and butane (C4H10) have different intermolecular forces that affect their boiling points. \n\nDiethyl ether has a polar oxygen atom, which leads to the presence of dipole-dipole interactions in addition to the London dispersion forces (induced dipole-induced dipole interactions) that are present in both molecules. \n\nButane, on the other hand, is a nonpolar molecule and only experiences London dispersion forces.\n\nSince dipole-dipole interactions are stronger than London dispersion forces, diethyl ether is expected to have a higher boiling point than butane due to the additional intermolecular forces present in its structure. \n\nIn practice, this prediction holds true: the boiling point of diethyl ether is approximately 34.6째C (94.3째F), while the boiling point of butane is approximately -0.5째C (31.1째F)."
