    "message_2": "When a foreign atom is adsorbed onto the surface of a metal, the surface energy of the metal can change due to several factors, such as the interaction between the foreign atom and the metal surface, the change in the electronic structure of the metal, and the possible reconstruction of the surface. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations can be used to investigate these changes and provide insights into the adsorption process.\n\n1. Interaction between the foreign atom and the metal surface: The adsorption of a foreign atom onto a metal surface can lead to the formation of chemical bonds between the foreign atom and the surface atoms. This can result in a change in the surface energy of the metal. DFT calculations can be used to determine the adsorption energy, which is the energy difference between the adsorbed state and the isolated metal surface and foreign atom. A negative adsorption energy indicates that the adsorption process is energetically favorable, while a positive value suggests that the process is unfavorable.\n\n2. Change in the electronic structure of the metal: The adsorption of a foreign atom can also lead to changes in the electronic structure of the metal surface. This can affect the surface energy of the metal. DFT calculations can be used to analyze the electronic structure of the metal before and after adsorption, including the density of states (DOS) and the distribution of the electron density. This information can provide insights into the nature of the bonding between the foreign atom and the metal surface, as well as the changes in the electronic properties of the metal due to the adsorption process.\n\n3. Surface reconstruction: In some cases, the adsorption of a foreign atom can cause the metal surface to undergo a structural rearrangement or reconstruction. This can lead to a change in the surface energy of the metal. DFT calculations can be used to investigate the possible surface reconstructions and their corresponding energies. By comparing the energies of the different reconstructions, one can determine the most stable configuration and the associated change in surface energy.\n\nIn summary, Density Functional Theory calculations can provide valuable insights into the changes in the surface energy of a metal upon the adsorption of a foreign atom. By analyzing the interaction between the foreign atom and the metal surface, the changes in the electronic structure of the metal, and the possible surface reconstructions, DFT calculations can help to understand the underlying mechanisms and predict the effects of adsorption on the surface energy of the metal."
