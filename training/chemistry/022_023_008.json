    "message_2": "To find the acid dissociation constant (Ka) for acetic acid, we can use the pH value and the initial concentration of the acetic acid. The dissociation of acetic acid can be represented as:\n\nCH3COOH ⇌ CH3COO- + H+\n\nFirst, we need to find the concentration of H+ ions using the pH value:\n\npH = -log[H+]\n\n4.76 = -log[H+]\n\n[H+] = 10^(-4.76) = 1.74 x 10^(-5) M\n\nNow, let's set up an equilibrium expression for the dissociation of acetic acid:\n\nKa = [CH3COO-][H+] / [CH3COOH]\n\nSince the initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.1 M, and the concentration of H+ ions is 1.74 x 10^(-5) M, we can assume that the concentration of CH3COO- ions is also 1.74 x 10^(-5) M (since they are produced in a 1:1 ratio). The concentration of CH3COOH will decrease by the same amount, so:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.1 - 1.74 x 10^(-5) ≈ 0.1 M (since 1.74 x 10^(-5) is very small compared to 0.1)\n\nNow we can plug these values into the equilibrium expression:\n\nKa = (1.74 x 10^(-5))(1.74 x 10^(-5)) / 0.1\n\nKa = 3.03 x 10^(-10)\n\nSo, the acid dissociation constant (Ka) for the 0.1 M solution of acetic acid with a pH of 4.76 at 25°C is approximately 3.03 x 10^(-10)."
