    "message_2": "To find the percent composition of sodium chloride (NaCl), we need to determine the mass of each element (sodium and chlorine) and then calculate the percentage of each element in the compound.\n\nFirst, we need the molar mass of each element:\n- Sodium (Na) has a molar mass of 22.99 g/mol.\n- Chlorine (Cl) has a molar mass of 35.45 g/mol.\n\nNow, we can find the molar mass of NaCl by adding the molar masses of Na and Cl:\nMolar mass of NaCl = 22.99 g/mol (Na) + 35.45 g/mol (Cl) = 58.44 g/mol\n\nNext, we calculate the percent composition of each element in NaCl:\n- Percent composition of Na = (molar mass of Na / molar mass of NaCl) × 100\n  = (22.99 g/mol / 58.44 g/mol) × 100 = 39.34%\n\n- Percent composition of Cl = (molar mass of Cl / molar mass of NaCl) × 100\n  = (35.45 g/mol / 58.44 g/mol) × 100 = 60.66%\n\nSo, the percent composition of sodium chloride (NaCl) is approximately 39.34% sodium (Na) and 60.66% chlorine (Cl)."
