    "message_1": "What is the resistance of an electrochemical cell with a concentration of 0.10 M CuSO4 solution and 0.10 M ZnSO4 solution at 25°C, if the cell has a total area of 25 cm2 and the distance between electrodes is 2 mm? Also, calculate the emf of the cell if the standard potential difference between Zn and Cu half-cells is 1.10 V. (Assume that the electrolyte resistance can be neglected compared to the internal cell resistance.)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the resistance of the electrochemical cell, we can use Ohm's law, which states that the resistance (R) is equal to the resistivity (ρ) multiplied by the length (L) and divided by the cross-sectional area (A). However, since we are asked to neglect the electrolyte resistance, we can assume that the internal cell resistance is negligible as well. Therefore, the resistance of the electrochemical cell is approximately 0 ohms.\n\nNow, let's calculate the emf (electromotive force) of the cell. The emf of an electrochemical cell is the difference in the standard reduction potentials of the two half-cells. In this case, we are given the standard potential difference between Zn and Cu half-cells as 1.10 V. Since the emf is equal to the potential difference, the emf of the cell is 1.10 V."
