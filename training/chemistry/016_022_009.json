The reaction is carried out at a constant pressure of 1 atm and a temperature of 298 K.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the isomerization of butene-1 to butene-2, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH = ΣΔHf(products) - ΣΔHf(reactants)\n\nIn this case, the reactant is butene-1 and the product is butene-2. The standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) for butene-1 is -25.3 kJ/mol, and for butene-2 is -23.6 kJ/mol.\n\nThe reaction can be written as:\n\nbutene-1 → butene-2\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the equation:\n\nΔH = (-23.6 kJ/mol) - (-25.3 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH = 1.7 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change for the isomerization of butene-1 to butene-2 is 1.7 kJ/mol."
