    "message_2": "To calculate the heat capacity of the water sample, we can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat capacity, m is the mass of the sample, c is the specific heat capacity of water, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nGiven:\nm = 50 g\nc = 4.184 J/g°C\nInitial temperature (T1) = 25°C\nFinal temperature (T2) = 45°C\n\nFirst, let's find the change in temperature (ΔT):\nΔT = T2 - T1 = 45°C - 25°C = 20°C\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat capacity (q):\nq = (50 g) × (4.184 J/g°C) × (20°C) = 4184 J\n\nThe heat capacity of the 50g sample of water heated from 25°C to 45°C is 4184 J."
