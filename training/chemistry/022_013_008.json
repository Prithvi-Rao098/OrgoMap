    "message_2": "In the compound CH3OH (methanol), the oxidation state of carbon can be determined by assigning oxidation states to each atom and ensuring that the sum of the oxidation states equals the overall charge of the compound, which is neutral in this case.\n\n1. Hydrogen (H) has an oxidation state of +1.\n2. Oxygen (O) has an oxidation state of -2.\n3. Carbon (C) is what we need to determine.\n\nIn CH3OH, there are three hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom bonded to the carbon atom. Using the oxidation states mentioned above, we can set up the following equation:\n\n3(+1) + (-2) + C = 0\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3 - 2 + C = 0\nC = -1\n\nSo, the oxidation state of carbon in CH3OH is -1."
