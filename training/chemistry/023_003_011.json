    "message_1": "What would be the expected yield of nylon-6,6 if 5 grams of adipic acid were reacted with excess hexamethylenediamine in a 1:1 molar ratio reaction?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the expected yield of nylon-6,6, we first need to determine the moles of adipic acid and then use the stoichiometry of the reaction to find the moles of nylon-6,6 produced. Finally, we can convert the moles of nylon-6,6 to grams.\n\n1. Calculate the moles of adipic acid:\nAdipic acid has a molecular formula of C6H10O4, and its molar mass is:\n(6 x 12.01) + (10 x 1.01) + (4 x 16.00) = 146.14 g/mol\n\nGiven that we have 5 grams of adipic acid:\nmoles of adipic acid = mass / molar mass\nmoles of adipic acid = 5 g / 146.14 g/mol = 0.0342 mol\n\n2. Use the stoichiometry of the reaction:\nThe reaction between adipic acid and hexamethylenediamine to form nylon-6,6 is a 1:1 molar ratio reaction. Therefore, the moles of nylon-6,6 produced will be equal to the moles of adipic acid reacted.\n\nmoles of nylon-6,6 = moles of adipic acid = 0.0342 mol\n\n3. Convert the moles of nylon-6,6 to grams:\nNylon-6,6 has a molecular formula of C12H22N2O2, and its molar mass is:\n(12 x 12.01) + (22 x 1.01) + (2 x 14.01) + (2 x 16.00) = 226.32 g/mol\n\nmass of nylon-6,6 = moles x molar mass\nmass of nylon-6,6 = 0.0342 mol x 226.32 g/mol = 7.74 g\n\nThe expected yield of nylon-6,6 is approximately 7.74 grams."
