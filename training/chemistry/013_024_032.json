    "message_2": "When a detergent or cleaning agent is added to water, the surface tension of the water decreases. The mechanism behind this change involves the amphiphilic nature of the detergent molecules.\n\nDetergent molecules have a dual nature: one end of the molecule is hydrophilic (water-loving), while the other end is hydrophobic (water-repelling). The hydrophilic end is attracted to water molecules, while the hydrophobic end is repelled by water and attracted to other hydrophobic substances, such as oils and greases.\n\nWhen detergent is added to water, the hydrophilic ends of the detergent molecules interact with the water molecules, while the hydrophobic ends are oriented away from the water. This arrangement disrupts the hydrogen bonding between water molecules at the surface, which is responsible for the high surface tension of water.\n\nAs a result, the surface tension of the water decreases, making it easier for the water to spread out and penetrate into surfaces. This property is essential for the cleaning action of detergents, as it allows the water to more effectively dissolve and remove dirt, grease, and other contaminants.\n\nIn summary, the addition of a detergent or cleaning agent to water reduces its surface tension due to the amphiphilic nature of the detergent molecules, which disrupt the hydrogen bonding between water molecules at the surface. This change in surface tension enhances the cleaning ability of the water by allowing it to more effectively dissolve and remove contaminants."
