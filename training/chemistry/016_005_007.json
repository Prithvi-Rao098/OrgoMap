    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of combustion of ethane (C2H6), we need to use the following equation:\n\nΔH_combustion = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nThe balanced combustion reaction for ethane is:\n\nC2H6 + 7/2 O2 → 2 CO2 + 3 H2O\n\nNow, we need to find the enthalpy of formation for each product and reactant:\n\nΔH_f(C2H6) = -84.7 kJ/mol\nΔH_f(CO2) = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔH_f(H2O) = -241.8 kJ/mol\nΔH_f(O2) = 0 kJ/mol (since O2 is in its standard state)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔH_combustion = [2 × ΔH_f(CO2) + 3 × ΔH_f(H2O)] - [ΔH_f(C2H6) + 7/2 × ΔH_f(O2)]\n\nΔH_combustion = [2 × (-393.5) + 3 × (-241.8)] - [-84.7 + 7/2 × 0]\n\nΔH_combustion = [-787 + (-725.4)] - [-84.7]\n\nΔH_combustion = -1512.4 + 84.7\n\nΔH_combustion = -1427.7 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy of combustion of ethane (C2H6) is -1427.7 kJ/mol."
