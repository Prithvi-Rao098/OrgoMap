    "message_1": "If the concentration of reactants in a gaseous equilibrium reaction is increased, how will the equilibrium constant be affected?",
    "message_2": "If the concentration of reactants in a gaseous equilibrium reaction is increased, the equilibrium constant (K) will not be affected. The equilibrium constant is a fixed value at a given temperature and is independent of the initial concentrations of reactants and products.\n\nHowever, increasing the concentration of reactants will cause the reaction to shift towards the products to re-establish equilibrium, according to Le Chatelier's principle. This will result in an increase in the concentration of products and a decrease in the concentration of reactants until a new equilibrium is reached, but the equilibrium constant itself will remain the same."
