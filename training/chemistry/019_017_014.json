    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy change for the sublimation of iodine at 25°C and 1 atm pressure, we need to consider the following steps:\n\n1. Heating the solid iodine from 25°C to its melting point (113.7°C)\n2. Melting the solid iodine (fusion)\n3. Heating the liquid iodine from its melting point (113.7°C) to its boiling point (184.3°C)\n4. Vaporizing the liquid iodine\n5. Heating the gaseous iodine from its boiling point (184.3°C) to 25°C\n\nStep 1: Heating the solid iodine from 25°C to its melting point (113.7°C)\nq1 = (heat capacity of iodine (solid)) * (ΔT)\nq1 = (54.3 J/mol*K) * (113.7°C - 25°C)\nq1 = 54.3 * 88.7 = 4817.81 J/mol\n\nStep 2: Melting the solid iodine (fusion)\nq2 = Heat of fusion of iodine\nq2 = 15.52 kJ/mol = 15520 J/mol\n\nStep 3: Heating the liquid iodine from its melting point (113.7°C) to its boiling point (184.3°C) is not needed, as we are calculating the enthalpy change for sublimation, which is a direct transition from solid to gas.\n\nStep 4: Vaporizing the liquid iodine\nq4 = Heat of vaporization of iodine\nq4 = 41.57 kJ/mol = 41570 J/mol\n\nStep 5: Heating the gaseous iodine from its boiling point (184.3°C) to 25°C\nq5 = (heat capacity of iodine (gas)) * (ΔT)\nq5 = (37.0 J/mol*K) * (25°C - 184.3°C)\nq5 = 37.0 * (-159.3) = -5894.1 J/mol\n\nNow, we can find the total enthalpy change for the sublimation of iodine:\nΔH_sublimation = q1 + q2 + q4 + q5\nΔH_sublimation = 4817.81 + 15520 + 41570 - 5894.1\nΔH_sublimation = 56013.71 J/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the sublimation of iodine at 25°C and 1 atm pressure is 56.01 kJ/mol."
