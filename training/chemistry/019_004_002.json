The equation for this is:\n\nΔS = ΣnS(products) - ΣnS(reactants)\n\nwhere n is the stoichiometric coefficient and S is the standard molar entropy.\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\nΔS = [2 × S(H2O(l))] - [2 × S(H2(g)) + S(O2(g))]\n\nNow, we can plug in the given standard molar entropy values:\n\nΔS = [2 × 69.91 J/K mol] - [2 × 130.68 J/K mol + 205.03 J/K mol]\n\nΔS = [139.82 J/K mol] - [261.36 J/K mol + 205.03 J/K mol]\n\nΔS = 139.82 J/K mol - 466.39 J/K mol\n\nΔS = -326.57 J/K mol\n\nThe entropy change (ΔS) for the reaction is -326.57 J/K mol."
