    "message_2": "To synthesize a secondary alcohol with three carbon atoms, we can use 1-propanol (CH3CH2CH2OH) and a primary halogenoalkane, such as 1-bromopropane (CH3CH2CH2Br). Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) will be used as the nucleophile in this reaction.\n\nHere is the step-by-step procedure for the synthesis:\n\n1. Prepare a solution of sodium hydroxide by dissolving an appropriate amount of NaOH in water.\n\n2. In a round-bottom flask, add 1-propanol and 1-bromopropane.\n\n3. Slowly add the sodium hydroxide solution to the flask containing the 1-propanol and 1-bromopropane mixture. Stir the mixture to ensure proper mixing of the reactants.\n\n4. Set up a reflux apparatus by attaching a condenser to the round-bottom flask. Make sure the condenser is connected to a water source for cooling.\n\n5. Heat the reaction mixture under reflux for one hour. This will allow the nucleophilic substitution reaction to occur, where the hydroxide ion (OH-) from sodium hydroxide will replace the bromine atom in 1-bromopropane, forming the desired secondary alcohol, 2-propanol (CH3CHOHCH3).\n\n6. After refluxing for one hour, allow the reaction mixture to cool to room temperature.\n\n7. Separate the organic layer from the aqueous layer using a separatory funnel.\n\n8. Dry the organic layer using an appropriate drying agent, such as anhydrous sodium sulfate (Na2SO4).\n\n9. Filter the drying agent and collect the filtrate, which contains the synthesized 2-propanol.\n\n10. Purify the 2-propanol by distillation, collecting the fraction that boils at the appropriate boiling point for 2-propanol (approximately 82Â°C).\n\nThe final product is the secondary alcohol, 2-propanol (CH3CHOHCH3), synthesized through a nucleophilic substitution reaction between 1-propanol and 1-bromopropane, using sodium hydroxide as the nucleophile and refluxing the mixture for one hour."
