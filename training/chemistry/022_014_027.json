    "message_2": "First, we need to determine the moles of sodium metal (Na) in 25 grams. The molar mass of Na is 22.99 g/mol.\n\nmoles of Na = mass of Na / molar mass of Na\nmoles of Na = 25 g / 22.99 g/mol = 1.087 moles\n\nNow, we can use the stoichiometry of the balanced chemical equation to determine the moles of chlorine gas (Cl2) required to react with 1.087 moles of Na.\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 2 moles of Na react with 1 mole of Cl2. Therefore:\n\nmoles of Cl2 = moles of Na / 2\nmoles of Cl2 = 1.087 moles / 2 = 0.5435 moles\n\nNow, we can convert moles of Cl2 to mass. The molar mass of Cl2 is 2 * 35.45 g/mol (since there are two chlorine atoms in Cl2) = 70.9 g/mol.\n\nmass of Cl2 = moles of Cl2 * molar mass of Cl2\nmass of Cl2 = 0.5435 moles * 70.9 g/mol = 38.54 g\n\nSo, 38.54 grams of chlorine gas are required to react with 25 grams of sodium metal.\n\nNow, let's find the mass of sodium chloride (NaCl) produced. Since Cl2 is the limiting reactant, we can use the moles of Cl2 to determine the moles of NaCl produced.\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of Cl2 produces 2 moles of NaCl. Therefore:\n\nmoles of NaCl = moles of Cl2 * 2\nmoles of NaCl = 0.5435 moles * 2 = 1.087 moles\n\nSo, 1.087 moles of sodium chloride are produced."
