    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium concentration of C, we can use the equilibrium constant (Kc) expression and an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table.\n\nThe Kc expression for the given reaction is:\n\nKc = [C] / ([A][B])\n\nwhere [A], [B], and [C] are the equilibrium concentrations of A, B, and C, respectively.\n\nFirst, let's set up the ICE table:\n\n```\n          Initial    Change    Equilibrium\nA         0.1        -x         0.1 - x\nB         0.2        -x         0.2 - x\nC          0         +x          x\n```\n\nAt equilibrium, the reaction has proceeded to the point where the concentrations of A, B, and C satisfy the Kc expression:\n\n2.0 = x / ((0.1 - x)(0.2 - x))\n\nNow we need to solve for x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of C.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, but since Kc is not very large, we can make an approximation that x is small compared to the initial concentrations of A and B. Therefore, we can simplify the equation as follows:\n\n2.0 ≈ x / (0.1 * 0.2)\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nx ≈ 2.0 * 0.1 * 0.2\nx ≈ 0.04 M\n\nSo, the equilibrium concentration of C is approximately 0.04 M."
