    "message_2": "To determine the yield of 4-bromoacetanilide, we first need to find the molecular weights of acetanilide and 4-bromoacetanilide. \n\nAcetanilide (C8H9NO) has a molecular weight of:\n(12.01 x 8) + (1.01 x 9) + (14.01 x 1) + (16.00 x 1) = 135.17 g/mol\n\n4-Bromoacetanilide (C8H8BrNO) has a molecular weight of:\n(12.01 x 8) + (1.01 x 8) + (79.90 x 1) + (14.01 x 1) + (16.00 x 1) = 214.07 g/mol\n\nNow, we can use stoichiometry to determine the theoretical yield of 4-bromoacetanilide. Since there is a 1:1 ratio between acetanilide and 4-bromoacetanilide in the reaction, we can calculate the theoretical yield as follows:\n\n10 g acetanilide x (1 mol acetanilide / 135.17 g acetanilide) x (1 mol 4-bromoacetanilide / 1 mol acetanilide) x (214.07 g 4-bromoacetanilide / 1 mol 4-bromoacetanilide)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n10 g x (1 / 135.17) x (214.07 / 1) = 15.83 g of 4-bromoacetanilide\n\nAssuming complete conversion and purification of the product, the yield in grams is 15.83 grams.\n\nTo find the percentage yield, we can use the following formula:\n\nPercentage yield = (Actual yield / Theoretical yield) x 100\n\nIn this case, since we are assuming complete conversion and purification, the actual yield is equal to the theoretical yield:\n\nPercentage yield = (15.83 g / 15.83 g) x 100 = 100%\n\nSo, the yield of 4-bromoacetanilide is 15.83 grams and the percentage yield is 100%."
