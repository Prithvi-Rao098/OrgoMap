    "message_2": "The ammonium ion (NH4+) is formed when ammonia (NH3) gains a proton (H+). In the ammonium ion, the central nitrogen atom is bonded to four hydrogen atoms, and it has a positive charge.\n\nGeometry:\nThe electron-pair geometry of NH4+ is tetrahedral, as it has four bonding pairs of electrons around the central nitrogen atom. The molecular geometry is also tetrahedral, as all four electron pairs are involved in bonding with hydrogen atoms.\n\nPolarity:\nIn the ammonium ion, the nitrogen-hydrogen bonds are polar due to the difference in electronegativity between nitrogen (3.04) and hydrogen (2.20). However, the overall molecule is nonpolar because the four N-H bonds are arranged symmetrically in a tetrahedral shape, causing the individual bond dipoles to cancel each other out. As a result, the ammonium ion (NH4+) is nonpolar."
