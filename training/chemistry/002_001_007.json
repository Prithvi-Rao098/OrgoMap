    "message_2": "In acidic medium, potassium permanganate (KMnO4) reacts with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to form manganese dioxide (MnO2), potassium ions (K+), water (H2O), and oxygen gas (O2). The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\n2 KMnO4 + 3 H2O2 + 4 H+ â†’ 2 MnO2 + 2 K+ + 6 H2O + 3 O2"
