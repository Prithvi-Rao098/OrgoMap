    "message_2": "The standard enthalpy change for the fusion reaction of 1 mole of ice at 0°C to 1 mole of liquid water at 0°C can be calculated using the given standard enthalpy of fusion of water.\n\nSince the temperature remains constant at 0°C during the fusion process, we do not need to consider the specific heat capacity of water in this calculation.\n\nThe standard enthalpy of fusion of water is given as 6.02 kJ/mol. This value represents the energy required to convert 1 mole of ice at 0°C to 1 mole of liquid water at 0°C.\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the fusion reaction of 1 mole of ice at 0°C to 1 mole of liquid water at 0°C is 6.02 kJ/mol."
