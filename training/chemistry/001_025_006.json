    "message_2": "Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a crucial biomolecule that serves as the primary energy currency in living organisms. It is composed of an adenine base, a ribose sugar, and three phosphate groups. The major functional groups present in ATP are:\n\n1. Adenine base: This is a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic aromatic compound, which is a part of the purine family. The adenine base in ATP is responsible for its ability to interact with other biomolecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids, through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. These interactions are essential for the recognition and binding of ATP to specific enzymes and other cellular components.\n\n2. Ribose sugar: This is a five-carbon sugar (pentose) with an aldehyde functional group at the first carbon and hydroxyl groups at the other carbons. The ribose sugar serves as the backbone of ATP, connecting the adenine base to the phosphate groups. The hydroxyl groups on the ribose sugar can participate in hydrogen bonding and other interactions, contributing to the overall stability and conformation of ATP within the cell.\n\n3. Phosphate groups: ATP contains three phosphate groups, which are connected through phosphoanhydride bonds. The phosphate groups are characterized by a central phosphorus atom surrounded by four oxygen atoms, with one of the oxygen atoms carrying a negative charge. The phosphate groups play a critical role in the biochemical reactions involving ATP, as the energy stored in the phosphoanhydride bonds is released upon hydrolysis. This energy release drives various cellular processes, such as muscle contraction, nerve impulse propagation, and biosynthesis of macromolecules.\n\nIn summary, the major functional groups in ATP - the adenine base, ribose sugar, and phosphate groups - work together to enable ATP to serve as a versatile energy carrier and participate in numerous biochemical reactions within living organisms. The adenine base and ribose sugar provide structural stability and facilitate interactions with other biomolecules, while the phosphate groups store and release energy as needed for cellular processes."
