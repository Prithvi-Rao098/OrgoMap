    "message_2": "To find the pH of a 0.1 Molar solution of acetic acid, we can use the formula for the dissociation constant (Ka) and the definition of pH. The Ka expression for acetic acid (CH3COOH) is:\n\nKa = [CH3COO-] [H+] / [CH3COOH]\n\nSince the initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.1 M, we can assume that the change in concentration due to dissociation is small compared to the initial concentration. Therefore, we can set up the following equilibrium expression:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 = x * x / (0.1 - x)\n\nSince x is small compared to 0.1, we can approximate the expression as:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 = x^2 / 0.1\n\nNow, we can solve for x, which represents the concentration of [H+]:\n\nx^2 = 1.8 x 10^-5 * 0.1\nx^2 = 1.8 x 10^-6\nx = sqrt(1.8 x 10^-6)\nx ≈ 1.34 x 10^-3\n\nNow that we have the concentration of [H+], we can find the pH using the definition of pH:\n\npH = -log10([H+])\npH = -log10(1.34 x 10^-3)\npH ≈ 2.87\n\nThe pH of the 0.1 Molar solution of acetic acid is approximately 2.87."
