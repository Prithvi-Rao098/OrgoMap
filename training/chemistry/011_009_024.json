    "message_2": "When a molecule is excited to an excited state, its electronic structure changes due to the promotion of one or more electrons from lower-energy orbitals (usually bonding or non-bonding orbitals) to higher-energy orbitals (usually anti-bonding or higher-energy non-bonding orbitals). This process can be induced by the absorption of a photon or through other energy transfer mechanisms. The change in electronic structure can lead to changes in the molecular geometry, bond lengths, and bond angles, as well as the overall stability and reactivity of the molecule.\n\nTo accurately calculate the electronic structure of a molecule in an excited state, quantum chemical methods are employed. These methods are based on the principles of quantum mechanics and involve solving the Schrödinger equation for the molecular system. Some common quantum chemical methods used to study excited states include:\n\n1. Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT): TD-DFT is an extension of the widely used Density Functional Theory (DFT) that allows for the calculation of excited state properties. It involves solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation and provides a relatively efficient and accurate approach for studying excited states in medium to large-sized molecules.\n\n2. Configuration Interaction (CI) methods: CI methods involve the construction of a wavefunction as a linear combination of different electronic configurations (Slater determinants). By including more and more excited configurations, the accuracy of the method can be systematically improved. However, the computational cost increases rapidly with the size of the molecule and the number of configurations considered.\n\n3. Coupled Cluster (CC) methods: CC methods are based on the exponential ansatz for the wavefunction, which provides a more compact and accurate description of the electronic structure compared to CI methods. Excited states can be calculated using the equation-of-motion coupled cluster (EOM-CC) approach, which is particularly useful for studying electronically excited states and ionization processes.\n\n4. Multi-reference methods: These methods are designed to treat cases where more than one electronic configuration is important for describing the ground or excited state. Examples include the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) and multi-reference configuration interaction (MRCI) methods. These methods are particularly useful for studying cases where strong electron correlation effects are present, such as in cases of conical intersections and bond-breaking processes.\n\nIn summary, the electronic structure of a molecule changes upon excitation to an excited state due to the promotion of electrons to higher-energy orbitals. Quantum chemical methods, such as TD-DFT, CI, CC, and multi-reference methods, can be used to accurately calculate the electronic structure of excited states, providing insights into the properties and reactivity of molecules in these states."
