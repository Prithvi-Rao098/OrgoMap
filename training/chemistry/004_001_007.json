    "message_2": "To find the concentration of the hydrochloric acid solution, we can use the concept of titration and the balanced chemical equation:\n\nHCl (aq) + NaOH (aq) → NaCl (aq) + H2O (l)\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that the mole ratio of HCl to NaOH is 1:1.\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of NaOH used in the titration:\n\nmoles of NaOH = volume of NaOH (L) × concentration of NaOH (M)\nmoles of NaOH = 0.03487 L × 0.120 M\nmoles of NaOH = 0.0041844 mol\n\nSince the mole ratio of HCl to NaOH is 1:1, the moles of HCl will be equal to the moles of NaOH:\n\nmoles of HCl = 0.0041844 mol\n\nNow, we can find the concentration of the HCl solution:\n\nconcentration of HCl (M) = moles of HCl / volume of HCl (L)\nconcentration of HCl (M) = 0.0041844 mol / 0.02500 L\nconcentration of HCl (M) = 0.167376 M\n\nTherefore, the concentration of the hydrochloric acid solution is approximately 0.167 M."
