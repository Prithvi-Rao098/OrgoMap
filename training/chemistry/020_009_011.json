    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nKc = ([NO]^2 * [H2O]^3) / ([NH3]^2 * [O2]^3)\n\nUsing the equilibrium concentrations provided:\n\nKc = ([0.03]^2 * [0.09]^3) / ([0.08]^2 * [0.06]^3)\n\nKc = (0.0009 * 0.000729) / (0.0064 * 0.000216)\n\nKc ≈ 1.56\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction at 25°C is approximately 1.56."
