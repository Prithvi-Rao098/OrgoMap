    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy of formation of MgO, we can use the given standard enthalpies of combustion. The combustion reactions for Mg and MgO are:\n\nMg(s) + 1/2 O2(g) -> MgO(s)  (ΔH_combustion = -601 kJ/mol)\nMgO(s) + 2 HCl(aq) -> MgCl2(aq) + H2O(l)  (ΔH_combustion = -3811 kJ/mol)\n\nNow, we can use Hess's Law to find the enthalpy of formation of MgO. We need to manipulate the given reactions to match the target reaction:\n\n2 Mg(s) + O2(g) -> 2 MgO(s)\n\nFirst, multiply the first reaction by 2:\n\n2 Mg(s) + O2(g) -> 2 MgO(s)  (ΔH = -1202 kJ/mol)\n\nNow, the first reaction matches the target reaction. Therefore, the standard enthalpy of formation of MgO is -1202 kJ/mol for 2 moles of MgO. To find the enthalpy of formation for 1 mole of MgO, divide by 2:\n\nΔH_formation (MgO) = -1202 kJ/mol / 2 = -601 kJ/mol"
