    "message_1": "What is the pH of a buffer solution made from 0.2 M acetic acid and 0.1 M sodium acetate, given that the pKa of acetic acid is 4.76?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which relates the pH, pKa, and the concentrations of the weak acid and its conjugate base in a buffer solution. The equation is:\n\npH = pKa + log ([A-]/[HA])\n\nwhere pH is the pH of the buffer solution, pKa is the acid dissociation constant of the weak acid, [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base, and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid.\n\nIn this case, the pKa of acetic acid is 4.76, the concentration of the conjugate base (sodium acetate) is 0.1 M, and the concentration of the weak acid (acetic acid) is 0.2 M. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\npH = 4.76 + log (0.1/0.2)\n\npH = 4.76 + log (0.5)\n\npH = 4.76 - 0.301 (since log(0.5) = -0.301)\n\npH â‰ˆ 4.46\n\nSo, the pH of the buffer solution made from 0.2 M acetic acid and 0.1 M sodium acetate is approximately 4.46."
