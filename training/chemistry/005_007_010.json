    "message_2": "During transcription, RNA polymerase reads the DNA template strand and synthesizes a corresponding RNA molecule. The molecular mechanism of this process can be broken down into several key steps, which involve specific interactions between RNA polymerase, DNA, and ribonucleotides.\n\n1. Initiation: The process begins with the binding of RNA polymerase to a specific DNA sequence called the promoter. This binding causes the DNA double helix to unwind, creating a transcription bubble. The RNA polymerase holoenzyme, which consists of a core enzyme and a sigma factor, recognizes the promoter region. The sigma factor is responsible for the specific recognition of the promoter sequence, while the core enzyme is responsible for catalyzing the synthesis of RNA.\n\n2. Elongation: Once the transcription bubble is formed, RNA polymerase starts reading the DNA template strand in the 3' to 5' direction. It adds complementary ribonucleotides to the growing RNA chain, which is synthesized in the 5' to 3' direction. The RNA polymerase active site contains a catalytic center that facilitates the formation of phosphodiester bonds between the ribonucleotides. The enzyme uses base pairing rules to ensure accurate synthesis of the RNA molecule: adenine (A) in the DNA template pairs with uracil (U) in RNA, and cytosine (C) pairs with guanine (G).\n\n3. Proofreading: RNA polymerase has a proofreading function that helps maintain the fidelity of transcription. If an incorrect ribonucleotide is incorporated into the growing RNA chain, the enzyme can backtrack and cleave the incorrect nucleotide, allowing the correct one to be added. This proofreading activity helps minimize errors during transcription.\n\n4. Termination: Transcription ends when RNA polymerase encounters a specific DNA sequence called the terminator. There are two main types of termination mechanisms in bacteria: intrinsic termination and rho-dependent termination. Intrinsic termination relies on the formation of a hairpin structure in the newly synthesized RNA, which destabilizes the RNA-DNA hybrid and causes the RNA polymerase to dissociate from the DNA template. Rho-dependent termination involves the binding of a protein called Rho to the RNA molecule, which then moves along the RNA and interacts with RNA polymerase, causing it to dissociate from the DNA template.\n\nIn eukaryotes, termination is more complex and involves the cleavage of the RNA molecule and the addition of a poly(A) tail. After termination, the RNA molecule undergoes further processing, including splicing, capping, and polyadenylation, before it can be translated into a protein.\n\nIn summary, the molecular mechanism of transcription involves the specific interactions of RNA polymerase with the DNA template strand and ribonucleotides. The enzyme reads the DNA template, accurately synthesizes the corresponding RNA molecule, and ensures fidelity through its proofreading function. The process is regulated through initiation, elongation, and termination steps."
