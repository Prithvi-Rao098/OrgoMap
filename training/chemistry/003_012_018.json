    "message_1": "A container at room temperature contains two gases, oxygen, and nitrogen. The container has a small hole that allows gas molecules to escape. If the hole is big enough, which gas will escape faster and why? Calculate the ratio of their rates of effusion.",
    "message_2": "To determine which gas will escape faster, we can use Graham's law of effusion. Graham's law states that the rate of effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molar mass. Mathematically, it can be represented as:\n\nRate1 / Rate2 = √(M2 / M1)\n\nwhere Rate1 and Rate2 are the rates of effusion of gas 1 and gas 2, respectively, and M1 and M2 are their molar masses.\n\nThe molar mass of oxygen (O2) is 32 g/mol, and the molar mass of nitrogen (N2) is 28 g/mol. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\nRate_O2 / Rate_N2 = √(28 / 32)\n\nRate_O2 / Rate_N2 = √(0.875)\n\nRate_O2 / Rate_N2 ≈ 0.935\n\nSince the ratio is less than 1, this means that nitrogen gas (N2) will escape faster than oxygen gas (O2). The ratio of their rates of effusion is approximately 0.935:1 (N2:O2). This is because nitrogen has a lower molar mass than oxygen, and lighter gases effuse more quickly than heavier gases according to Graham's law."
