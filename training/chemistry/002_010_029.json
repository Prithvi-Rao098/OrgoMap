    "message_2": "To find the density of sodium chloride (NaCl), we can use the formula:\n\nDensity = mass/volume\n\nGiven the mass of NaCl is 5.5 grams and the volume it occupies is 2.1 mL, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nDensity = 5.5 g / 2.1 mL\n\nDensity ≈ 2.619 g/mL\n\nSo, the density of sodium chloride (NaCl) at 25°C is approximately 2.619 g/mL."
