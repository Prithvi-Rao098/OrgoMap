The initial concentration of NO is 0.02 M and the initial concentration of O₂ is 0.01 M. The rate of disappearance of NO is measured to be 2.8 × 10⁻⁵ M/s.",
    "message_2": "To find the rate law and rate constant for the reaction, we first need to write the rate law expression based on the given information. Since the reaction is first order in NO and O₂, the rate law expression will be:\n\nRate = k[NO]¹[O₂]¹\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values for the initial concentrations of NO and O₂, as well as the rate of disappearance of NO:\n\n2.8 × 10⁻⁵ M/s = k(0.02 M)(0.01 M)\n\nTo find the rate constant (k), we simply need to solve for k:\n\nk = (2.8 × 10⁻⁵ M/s) / ((0.02 M)(0.01 M))\nk = (2.8 × 10⁻⁵ M/s) / (2 × 10⁻⁴ M²)\nk = 1.4 × 10⁻¹ M⁻¹s⁻¹\n\nSo, the rate constant (k) for the reaction is 1.4 × 10⁻¹ M⁻¹s⁻¹, and the rate law is:\n\nRate = 1.4 × 10⁻¹ M⁻¹s⁻¹ [NO][O₂]"
