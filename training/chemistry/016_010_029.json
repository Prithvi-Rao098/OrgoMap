    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of solution for dissolving 5 grams of NaCl in 100 mL of water, we need to consider the heat absorbed by the water and the heat released by the NaCl.\n\nFirst, let's find the moles of NaCl:\nNaCl has a molar mass of 58.44 g/mol.\nmoles of NaCl = mass / molar mass\nmoles of NaCl = 5 g / 58.44 g/mol = 0.0856 mol\n\nNow, let's find the heat absorbed by the water:\nq_water = mass_water * specific heat capacity * change in temperature\nmass_water = 100 g (assuming the density of water is 1 g/mL)\nchange in temperature = final temperature - initial temperature = 25°C - 20°C = 5°C\nq_water = 100 g * 4.18 J/g°C * 5°C = 2090 J\n\nNext, let's find the heat released by the NaCl:\nq_NaCl = moles of NaCl * enthalpy of fusion\nq_NaCl = 0.0856 mol * -3.0 kJ/mol * 1000 J/kJ = -256.8 J\n\nNow, we can find the enthalpy of solution:\nq_solution = q_water + q_NaCl\nq_solution = 2090 J + (-256.8 J) = 1833.2 J\n\nFinally, we can find the molar enthalpy of solution by dividing the enthalpy of solution by the moles of NaCl:\nmolar enthalpy of solution = q_solution / moles of NaCl\nmolar enthalpy of solution = 1833.2 J / 0.0856 mol = 21416.3 J/mol\n\nThe enthalpy of solution for dissolving 5 grams of NaCl in 100 mL of water is 21416.3 J/mol."
