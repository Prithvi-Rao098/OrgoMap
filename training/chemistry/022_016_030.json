The balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane is CH4 + 2O2 -> CO2 + 2H2O.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of combustion of methane (ΔH_comb), we can use the following formula:\n\nΔH_comb = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nFor the balanced chemical equation: CH4 + 2O2 -> CO2 + 2H2O\n\nΔH_comb = [1 × ΔH_f(CO2) + 2 × ΔH_f(H2O)] - [1 × ΔH_f(CH4) + 2 × ΔH_f(O2)]\n\nSince the enthalpy of formation of O2 is 0 kJ/mol (it is in its standard state), the equation becomes:\n\nΔH_comb = [1 × (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 × (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [1 × (-74.8 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH_comb = [-393.5 - 2(285.8) + 74.8] kJ/mol\n\nΔH_comb = [-393.5 - 571.6 + 74.8] kJ/mol\n\nΔH_comb = -890.3 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy of combustion of methane with respect to carbon dioxide and water is -890.3 kJ/mol."
