    "message_2": "The reaction between calcium nitrate and ammonium sulfate is a double displacement reaction, which can be represented as follows:\n\nCa(NO3)2 + (NH4)2SO4 â†’ CaSO4 + 2 NH4NO3\n\nIn this reaction, calcium nitrate (Ca(NO3)2) reacts with ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4) to form calcium sulfate (CaSO4) and ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3). The balanced chemical equation is already provided."
