    "message_2": "To balance the chemical equation, we need to make sure that the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of the equation.\n\nFe + HCl → FeCl3 + H2\n\nFirst, balance the Fe (iron) atoms:\n1 Fe + HCl → 1 FeCl3 + H2 (Fe is already balanced)\n\nNext, balance the Cl (chlorine) atoms:\n1 Fe + 3 HCl → 1 FeCl3 + H2 (3 Cl atoms on both sides)\n\nFinally, balance the H (hydrogen) atoms:\n1 Fe + 3 HCl → 1 FeCl3 + 1.5 H2 (6 H atoms on both sides)\n\nHowever, it's better to have whole numbers in a balanced equation, so we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to achieve this:\n\n2 Fe + 6 HCl → 2 FeCl3 + 3 H2\n\nThe balanced chemical equation is:\n\n2 Fe + 6 HCl → 2 FeCl3 + 3 H2"
