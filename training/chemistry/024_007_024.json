    "message_2": "To optimize the yield of a desired pharmaceutical compound during the development of a chemical process, while ensuring economic feasibility and environmental sustainability, the following strategies can be employed:\n\n1. Selection of starting materials: Choose readily available, inexpensive, and sustainable starting materials to reduce costs and minimize environmental impact.\n\n2. Reaction optimization: Optimize reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and concentration, to maximize yield and minimize by-products. This can be achieved through systematic experimentation or computational methods.\n\n3. Catalysts: Utilize efficient and selective catalysts to improve reaction rates and selectivity, reducing the need for excess reactants and minimizing waste.\n\n4. Green chemistry principles: Implement green chemistry principles, such as using renewable feedstocks, minimizing waste, and using energy-efficient processes, to reduce the environmental impact of the process.\n\n5. Process intensification: Employ process intensification techniques, such as microreactors or continuous flow processes, to improve efficiency, reduce waste, and minimize energy consumption.\n\n6. Purification and separation: Develop efficient purification and separation methods to isolate the desired product from reaction mixtures, minimizing the use of hazardous solvents and reducing waste.\n\n7. Waste management: Implement waste management strategies, such as recycling or reusing solvents and other materials, to minimize waste generation and reduce disposal costs.\n\n8. Scale-up considerations: Carefully consider the scale-up of the process from the laboratory to industrial scale, ensuring that the process remains economically viable and environmentally sustainable at larger scales.\n\n9. Monitoring and control: Implement real-time monitoring and control systems to ensure consistent product quality and optimize process performance.\n\n10. Lifecycle assessment: Conduct a lifecycle assessment of the entire process to identify areas for improvement in terms of economic feasibility and environmental sustainability.\n\nBy incorporating these strategies into the development of a chemical process for pharmaceutical production, it is possible to optimize yield while maintaining economic feasibility and minimizing environmental impact."
