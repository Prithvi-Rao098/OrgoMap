    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant (K) for the formation of the complex ion [Fe(SCN)₂⁺], we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nFe³⁺(aq) + 2SCN⁻(aq) ⇌ [Fe(SCN)₂⁺](aq)\n\nNext, we need to determine the initial concentrations of the reactants and products. Since we know the moles and volume of the solution, we can calculate the initial concentrations:\n\nInitial concentration of Fe³⁺ = (3.0 x 10⁻³ moles) / (0.250 L) = 0.012 M\nInitial concentration of SCN⁻ = (1.5 x 10⁻³ moles) / (0.250 L) = 0.006 M\nInitial concentration of [Fe(SCN)₂⁺] = 0 M (since it has not formed yet)\n\nNow, we can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the concentrations at equilibrium:\n\n                 Fe³⁺(aq) + 2SCN⁻(aq) ⇌ [Fe(SCN)₂⁺](aq)\nInitial (M):        0.012        0.006             0\nChange (M):         -x          -2x               +x\nEquilibrium (M):  0.012-x      0.006-2x         1.2 x 10⁻³\n\nWe are given the equilibrium concentration of [Fe(SCN)₂⁺] as 1.2 x 10⁻³ M, so we can substitute that value for x:\n\n1.2 x 10⁻³ = x\n\nNow, we can find the equilibrium concentrations of Fe³⁺ and SCN⁻:\n\n[Fe³⁺] = 0.012 - x = 0.012 - 1.2 x 10⁻³ = 0.0108 M\n[SCN⁻] = 0.006 - 2x = 0.006 - 2(1.2 x 10⁻³) = 0.0036 M\n\nFinally, we can calculate the equilibrium constant (K) using the equilibrium concentrations:\n\nK = [Fe(SCN)₂⁺] / ([Fe³⁺][SCN⁻]²)\nK = (1.2 x 10⁻³) / ((0.0108)(0.0036)²)\nK = (1.2 x 10⁻³) / (0.0108 x 0.00001296)\nK ≈ 9.2\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (K) for the formation of the complex ion [Fe(SCN)₂⁺] is approximately 9.2."
