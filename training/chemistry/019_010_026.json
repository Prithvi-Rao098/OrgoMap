    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of propane, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the combustion reaction:\n\nC3H8(g) + 5O2(g) → 3CO2(g) + 4H2O(l)\n\nNext, we need to find the standard enthalpies of formation (∆Hf°) for each compound involved in the reaction. The values are as follows:\n\n∆Hf° [C3H8(g)] = -103.85 kJ/mol\n∆Hf° [O2(g)] = 0 kJ/mol (since it's an element in its standard state)\n∆Hf° [CO2(g)] = -393.5 kJ/mol\n∆Hf° [H2O(l)] = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction (∆H°) using the following equation:\n\n∆H° = [sum of (moles × ∆Hf° of products)] - [sum of (moles × ∆Hf° of reactants)]\n\n∆H° = [(3 × -393.5) + (4 × -285.8)] - [(1 × -103.85) + (5 × 0)]\n\n∆H° = (-1180.5 + -1143.2) - (-103.85)\n\n∆H° = -2323.7 + 103.85\n\n∆H° = -2219.85 kJ\n\nSince this is the enthalpy change for 3 moles of propane, we need to divide by 3 to get the enthalpy change per mole of propane:\n\n∆H° (per mole of propane) = -2219.85 kJ / 3\n\n∆H° (per mole of propane) = -739.95 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of 1 mole of propane gas (C3H8) at standard conditions is approximately -739.95 kJ/mol."
