    "message_1": "What mass of silver (Ag) will be deposited on the cathode when a constant current of 2 A is passed through a solution of silver nitrate (AgNO3) for 2 hours? The molar mass of Ag is 107.9 g/mol, and the Faraday constant is 96,485 C/mol.",
    "message_2": "To find the mass of silver deposited on the cathode, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total charge passed through the solution.\n2. Determine the number of moles of electrons transferred.\n3. Calculate the number of moles of silver deposited.\n4. Convert moles of silver to mass.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total charge passed through the solution.\nCurrent (I) = 2 A\nTime (t) = 2 hours = 2 × 3600 seconds = 7200 seconds\nTotal charge (Q) = Current × Time = 2 A × 7200 s = 14,400 Coulombs\n\nStep 2: Determine the number of moles of electrons transferred.\nFaraday constant (F) = 96,485 C/mol\nMoles of electrons (n) = Total charge / Faraday constant = 14,400 C / 96,485 C/mol = 0.1492 mol\n\nStep 3: Calculate the number of moles of silver deposited.\nThe reaction occurring at the cathode is Ag+ + e- → Ag. This means that one mole of electrons will deposit one mole of silver.\nMoles of silver (n_Ag) = Moles of electrons = 0.1492 mol\n\nStep 4: Convert moles of silver to mass.\nMolar mass of silver (M_Ag) = 107.9 g/mol\nMass of silver (m_Ag) = Moles of silver × Molar mass of silver = 0.1492 mol × 107.9 g/mol = 16.10 g\n\nSo, the mass of silver deposited on the cathode is 16.10 grams."
