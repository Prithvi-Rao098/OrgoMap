    "message_2": "To determine the vibrational frequency and the corresponding IR spectrum for the molecule CH4 (methane) in its ground state using quantum chemistry calculations, we need to perform a vibrational analysis using computational chemistry software. Here, I will provide a general outline of the process.\n\n1. Choose a suitable computational chemistry software package, such as Gaussian, ORCA, or NWChem.\n\n2. Set up the input file for the software, specifying the molecule's geometry (coordinates of the atoms), the level of theory (e.g., Hartree-Fock, DFT, or post-Hartree-Fock methods), and the basis set (e.g., 6-31G, cc-pVDZ).\n\n3. Request a frequency calculation in the input file. This will calculate the vibrational frequencies and normal modes of the molecule.\n\n4. Run the calculation using the software.\n\n5. Analyze the output file. The vibrational frequencies will be reported in units of wavenumbers (cm⁻¹). Methane (CH4) has 12 vibrational modes in total, but due to its symmetry (T_d), only 4 unique modes are present: 2A1, 2E, and 1T2. The IR-active modes are 2A1 and 2E.\n\nThe vibrational frequencies for methane typically fall within the following ranges:\n\n- The 2A1 symmetric stretching mode is around 2910 cm⁻¹.\n- The 2E asymmetric stretching mode is around 3010 cm⁻¹.\n- The 1T2 bending mode is around 1300 cm⁻¹.\n\nThese values can vary slightly depending on the level of theory and basis set used in the calculation.\n\nThe corresponding IR spectrum will show two main peaks corresponding to the IR-active modes (2A1 and 2E) in the regions mentioned above. The exact positions and intensities of these peaks will depend on the specific computational method and basis set used."
