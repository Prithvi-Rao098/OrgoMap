    "message_1": "What mass of uranium-235 is required to produce 1 GW of power continuously for 1 year if the energy released per fission is 200 MeV and the efficiency of power plants is 33%?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the mass of uranium-235 required, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert 1 GW of power to energy in joules.\n2. Calculate the energy produced by uranium-235 in one year considering the efficiency of the power plant.\n3. Convert the energy released per fission from MeV to joules.\n4. Calculate the number of fissions required to produce the energy in one year.\n5. Calculate the mass of uranium-235 required for the number of fissions.\n\nStep 1: Convert 1 GW of power to energy in joules\n1 GW = 1 × 10^9 W\n1 year = 365 days × 24 hours/day × 60 minutes/hour × 60 seconds/minute = 31,536,000 seconds\n\nEnergy = Power × Time\nEnergy = 1 × 10^9 W × 31,536,000 s\nEnergy = 3.1536 × 10^16 J\n\nStep 2: Calculate the energy produced by uranium-235 in one year considering the efficiency of the power plant\nEfficiency = 33% = 0.33\nEnergy produced by uranium-235 = Energy / Efficiency\nEnergy produced by uranium-235 = 3.1536 × 10^16 J / 0.33\nEnergy produced by uranium-235 = 9.5576 × 10^16 J\n\nStep 3: Convert the energy released per fission from MeV to joules\n1 MeV = 1 × 10^6 eV\n1 eV = 1.602 × 10^(-19) J\n\nEnergy released per fission = 200 MeV × 1 × 10^6 eV/MeV × 1.602 × 10^(-19) J/eV\nEnergy released per fission = 3.204 × 10^(-11) J\n\nStep 4: Calculate the number of fissions required to produce the energy in one year\nNumber of fissions = Energy produced by uranium-235 / Energy released per fission\nNumber of fissions = 9.5576 × 10^16 J / 3.204 × 10^(-11) J\nNumber of fissions = 2.984 × 10^27\n\nStep 5: Calculate the mass of uranium-235 required for the number of fissions\n1 mole of uranium-235 = 235 g\n1 mole of uranium-235 = 6.022 × 10^23 atoms\n\nMass of uranium-235 = (Number of fissions × 235 g) / (6.022 × 10^23 atoms)\nMass of uranium-235 = (2.984 × 10^27 × 235) / (6.022 × 10^23)\nMass of uranium-235 = 1.163 × 10^4 g\n\nSo, the mass of uranium-235 required to produce 1 GW of power continuously for 1 year with 33% efficiency is approximately 11,630 kg."
