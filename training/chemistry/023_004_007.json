    "message_2": "To determine the maximum yield of acetylsalicylic acid, we need to use stoichiometry. First, we need to know the balanced chemical equation for the synthesis of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) from salicylic acid and acetic anhydride:\n\nC7H6O3 (salicylic acid) + C4H6O3 (acetic anhydride) â†’ C9H8O4 (acetylsalicylic acid) + C2H4O2 (acetic acid)\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of salicylic acid reacts with 1 mole of acetic anhydride to produce 1 mole of acetylsalicylic acid.\n\nNow, we need to find the molar mass of salicylic acid and acetylsalicylic acid:\n\nSalicylic acid (C7H6O3): (12.01 * 7) + (1.01 * 6) + (16.00 * 3) = 138.12 g/mol\nAcetylsalicylic acid (C9H8O4): (12.01 * 9) + (1.01 * 8) + (16.00 * 4) = 180.16 g/mol\n\nNext, we need to convert the given mass of salicylic acid (2 grams) to moles:\n\n2 g salicylic acid * (1 mol salicylic acid / 138.12 g salicylic acid) = 0.01448 mol salicylic acid\n\nSince the reaction proceeds to completion and the final product is pure, we can assume that all of the salicylic acid is converted to acetylsalicylic acid. Therefore, we can convert the moles of salicylic acid to moles of acetylsalicylic acid:\n\n0.01448 mol salicylic acid * (1 mol acetylsalicylic acid / 1 mol salicylic acid) = 0.01448 mol acetylsalicylic acid\n\nFinally, we can convert the moles of acetylsalicylic acid to grams:\n\n0.01448 mol acetylsalicylic acid * (180.16 g acetylsalicylic acid / 1 mol acetylsalicylic acid) = 2.607 g acetylsalicylic acid\n\nThe maximum yield of acetylsalicylic acid that can be obtained from 2 grams of salicylic acid and excess acetic anhydride is approximately 2.607 grams."
