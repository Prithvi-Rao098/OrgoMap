    "message_2": "To find the density of potassium chloride (KCl), we can use the formula:\n\nDensity = mass/volume\n\nGiven that the mass of the sample is 35.5 g and the volume is 25.0 mL, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nDensity = 35.5 g / 25.0 mL = 1.42 g/mL\n\nSo, the density of potassium chloride (KCl) is 1.42 g/mL."
