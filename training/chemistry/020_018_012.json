    "message_1": "What is the new equilibrium concentration of the complex ion [Ag(NH3)2]Cl when 10 mL of 0.1 M AgNO3 solution is mixed with 20 mL of 0.05 M NH3 solution? The formation constant of [Ag(NH3)2]+ is 1.5 x 10^7.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first determine the initial concentrations of the reactants and then use the formation constant to find the equilibrium concentration of the complex ion [Ag(NH3)2]Cl.\n\n1. Determine the initial concentrations of the reactants:\n\nAgNO3: \nInitial moles = volume (L) × concentration (M)\nInitial moles = 0.010 L × 0.1 M = 0.001 mol\n\nNH3:\nInitial moles = volume (L) × concentration (M)\nInitial moles = 0.020 L × 0.05 M = 0.001 mol\n\n2. Determine the total volume of the solution:\nTotal volume = volume of AgNO3 + volume of NH3\nTotal volume = 0.010 L + 0.020 L = 0.030 L\n\n3. Calculate the initial concentrations in the mixed solution:\n\n[Ag+] initial = moles of AgNO3 / total volume\n[Ag+] initial = 0.001 mol / 0.030 L = 0.0333 M\n\n[NH3] initial = moles of NH3 / total volume\n[NH3] initial = 0.001 mol / 0.030 L = 0.0333 M\n\n4. Write the reaction and the formation constant expression:\n\nAg+ + 2NH3 <=> [Ag(NH3)2]+\n\nKf = [Ag(NH3)2+] / ([Ag+][NH3]^2)\n\n5. Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:\n\n|          | Ag+ | NH3 | [Ag(NH3)2]+ |\n|----------|-----|-----|------------|\n| Initial  |0.0333|0.0333|      0      |\n| Change   |-x   |-2x  |      x      |\n| Equilibrium |0.0333-x|0.0333-2x|    x    |\n\n6. Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n\nKf = (x) / ((0.0333-x)(0.0333-2x)^2)\n\n1.5 x 10^7 = (x) / ((0.0333-x)(0.0333-2x)^2)\n\n7. Since Kf is large, we can assume that x is small compared to 0.0333. Therefore, we can simplify the equation:\n\n1.5 x 10^7 = (x) / ((0.0333)(0.0333-2x)^2)\n\n8. Solve for x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of [Ag(NH3)2]+:\n\nx = 1.5 x 10^7 * (0.0333)(0.0333-2x)^2\n\nBy solving this equation, we get:\n\nx ≈ 0.0276 M\n\nSo, the new equilibrium concentration of the complex ion [Ag(NH3)2]Cl is approximately 0.0276 M."
