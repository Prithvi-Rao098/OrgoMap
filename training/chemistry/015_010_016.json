    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic susceptibility (χ) of a molecule, we need to determine the magnetic moment (μ) of the molecule and then use the Curie law. The magnetic moment can be calculated using the formula:\n\nμ = gJ * μB * √(J(J+1))\n\nwhere gJ is the Landé g-factor, μB is the Bohr magneton (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T), and J is the total angular momentum quantum number.\n\nThe Landé g-factor (gJ) can be calculated using the formula:\n\ngJ = (3J(J+1) + S(S+1) - L(L+1)) / 2J(J+1)\n\nPlugging in the given quantum numbers (S=1, L=2, and J=3/2):\n\ngJ = (3(3/2)(5/2) + 1(2) - 2(3)) / 2(3/2)(5/2)\ngJ = (15/2 + 2 - 6) / 15\ngJ = 1/2\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic moment (μ):\n\nμ = (1/2) * (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T) * √((3/2)(5/2))\nμ = 0.5 * (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T) * √(15/4)\nμ = 4.637 x 10^-24 J/T\n\nNow, we can use the Curie law to calculate the magnetic susceptibility (χ):\n\nχ = (n * μ^2) / (3 * k * T)\n\nwhere n is the number of molecules per unit volume, k is the Boltzmann constant (1.381 x 10^-23 J/K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin. However, we are asked to find the magnetic susceptibility in cm^3 mol^-1, so we need to modify the formula to:\n\nχ = (N_A * μ^2) / (3 * k * T)\n\nwhere N_A is Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23 mol^-1).\n\nAssuming room temperature (T = 298 K):\n\nχ = (6.022 x 10^23 mol^-1 * (4.637 x 10^-24 J/T)^2) / (3 * 1.381 x 10^-23 J/K * 298 K)\nχ = (6.022 x 10^23 mol^-1 * 2.149 x 10^-47 J^2/T^2) / (1.237 x 10^-20 J K^-1)\nχ = 1.293 x 10^-27 cm^3 mol^-1\n\nSo, the magnetic susceptibility of the molecule in the presence of an external magnetic field of 0.5 T is approximately 1.293 x 10^-27 cm^3 mol^-1."
