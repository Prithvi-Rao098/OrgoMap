    "message_2": "To determine the standard enthalpy change for the precipitation reaction between aqueous solutions of lead(II) nitrate and potassium iodide, we first need the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nPb(NO₃)₂(aq) + 2 KI(aq) → PbI₂(s) + 2 KNO₃(aq)\n\nNext, we need the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) for each of the compounds involved in the reaction. These values can be found in a standard thermodynamic table. The values are:\n\nΔHf° [Pb(NO₃)₂(aq)] = -437 kJ/mol\nΔHf° [KI(aq)] = -327 kJ/mol\nΔHf° [PbI₂(s)] = -288 kJ/mol\nΔHf° [KNO₃(aq)] = -494 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can use Hess's Law to calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nΔH° = Σ [ΔHf°(products)] - Σ [ΔHf°(reactants)]\n\nΔH° = [(1 × -288 kJ/mol) + (2 × -494 kJ/mol)] - [(1 × -437 kJ/mol) + (2 × -327 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH° = (-288 - 988) - (-437 - 654)\nΔH° = -1276 + 1091\nΔH° = -185 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the precipitation reaction between aqueous solutions of lead(II) nitrate and potassium iodide that produces solid lead(II) iodide and aqueous potassium nitrate is -185 kJ/mol."
