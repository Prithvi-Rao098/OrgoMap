    "message_2": "The optimal reaction conditions for synthesizing high molecular weight polyacrylonitrile (PAN) from acrylonitrile monomer with maximum yield and purity are as follows:\n\n1. Temperature: The optimal temperature for PAN synthesis is typically in the range of 60-70°C. This temperature range allows for a controlled polymerization rate, ensuring a high molecular weight product without causing premature termination or side reactions.\n\n2. Pressure: The polymerization of acrylonitrile is usually carried out under atmospheric pressure. However, if the reaction is performed in a closed system, a slight positive pressure (e.g., 1-2 bar) can be applied to prevent the ingress of air and moisture, which could lead to impurities in the final product.\n\n3. Catalyst: The most common catalysts used for the synthesis of PAN are redox initiators, such as ammonium persulfate (APS) and sodium metabisulfite (SMBS). The optimal catalyst concentration depends on the desired molecular weight and reaction rate, but typically falls in the range of 0.1-1.0 wt% relative to the monomer.\n\n4. Reaction time: The reaction time for PAN synthesis depends on the desired molecular weight and reaction conditions. Generally, higher molecular weight PAN requires longer reaction times. For a high molecular weight PAN, the reaction time can range from several hours to a couple of days. It is essential to monitor the reaction progress by analyzing the molecular weight and conversion of the polymer at regular intervals.\n\n5. Solvent: The polymerization of acrylonitrile is often carried out in an aqueous medium, as water-soluble initiators can be used, and the heat generated during the reaction can be easily dissipated. However, other solvents, such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or dimethylformamide (DMF), can also be used to control the reaction rate and achieve higher molecular weights.\n\n6. Inhibitors: To prevent premature polymerization and ensure maximum yield and purity, inhibitors such as hydroquinone or methyl hydroquinone can be added to the reaction mixture at a concentration of around 10-50 ppm.\n\nIn summary, the optimal reaction conditions for synthesizing high molecular weight PAN from acrylonitrile monomer with maximum yield and purity involve a temperature of 60-70°C, atmospheric pressure, redox initiators as catalysts, reaction times ranging from several hours to a couple of days, and the use of appropriate solvents and inhibitors."
