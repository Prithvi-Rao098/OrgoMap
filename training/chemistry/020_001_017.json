    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction, we first need to determine the equilibrium concentrations of all species involved in the reaction. We are given the equilibrium concentrations of H2 and I2, but we need to find the equilibrium concentration of HI.\n\nInitial moles of H2 = 0.05 moles\nInitial moles of I2 = 0.035 moles\n\nInitial concentration of H2 = moles/volume = 0.05/2.5 = 0.02 M\nInitial concentration of I2 = moles/volume = 0.035/2.5 = 0.014 M\n\nSince the balanced equation shows that 1 mole of H2 reacts with 1 mole of I2 to produce 2 moles of HI, we can set up a reaction table to find the equilibrium concentration of HI:\n\n          H2(g) + I2(g) ⇌ 2HI(g)\nInitial:  0.02 M    0.014 M      0 M\nChange:  -x         -x          +2x\nEquilibrium: 0.014 M  0.007 M     2x\n\nNow we can solve for x:\n\n0.02 - x = 0.014\nx = 0.006\n\nSince the change in HI is +2x, the equilibrium concentration of HI is:\n\n2x = 2(0.006) = 0.012 M\n\nNow we can find the equilibrium constant (Kc) using the equilibrium concentrations:\n\nKc = [HI]^2 / ([H2][I2])\nKc = (0.012)^2 / (0.014 * 0.007)\nKc ≈ 12.245\n\nThe equilibrium constant for the reaction is approximately 12.245."
