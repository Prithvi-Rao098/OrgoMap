    "message_2": "In KMnO4, the oxidation state of Manganese (Mn) is +7.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the oxidation states for each element in the compound:\n\n1. Potassium (K) has an oxidation state of +1.\n2. Manganese (Mn) has an unknown oxidation state, which we'll represent as x.\n3. Oxygen (O) has an oxidation state of -2, and there are four oxygen atoms, so the total oxidation state for oxygen is -8.\n\nNow, we can set up an equation to find the oxidation state of Manganese:\n\n(+1) + x + (-8) = 0\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx = 8 - 1\nx = 7\n\nSo, the oxidation state of Manganese in KMnO4 is +7."
