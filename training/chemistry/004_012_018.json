    "message_2": "To determine the percent composition of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen in a sample of caffeine, we first need to know the molecular formula of caffeine. The molecular formula for caffeine is C8H10N4O2.\n\nNow, we can calculate the molar mass of caffeine:\nCarbon (C): 8 atoms × 12.01 g/mol = 96.08 g/mol\nHydrogen (H): 10 atoms × 1.01 g/mol = 10.10 g/mol\nNitrogen (N): 4 atoms × 14.01 g/mol = 56.04 g/mol\nOxygen (O): 2 atoms × 16.00 g/mol = 32.00 g/mol\n\nTotal molar mass of caffeine: 96.08 + 10.10 + 56.04 + 32.00 = 194.22 g/mol\n\nNow, we can determine the percent composition of each element in caffeine:\nCarbon (C): (96.08 g/mol / 194.22 g/mol) × 100% = 49.48%\nHydrogen (H): (10.10 g/mol / 194.22 g/mol) × 100% = 5.20%\nNitrogen (N): (56.04 g/mol / 194.22 g/mol) × 100% = 28.85%\nOxygen (O): (32.00 g/mol / 194.22 g/mol) × 100% = 16.47%\n\nSince the problem only asks for the percent composition of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen, we have:\nCarbon: 49.48%\nHydrogen: 5.20%\nNitrogen: 28.85%\n\nNow, let's calculate the empirical formula for caffeine using the elemental analysis data. We will assume that we have 100 g of caffeine, so the mass of each element will be equal to its percentage:\n\nCarbon: 49.48 g\nHydrogen: 5.20 g\nNitrogen: 28.85 g\n\nNext, we will convert these masses to moles:\nCarbon: 49.48 g / 12.01 g/mol = 4.12 mol\nHydrogen: 5.20 g / 1.01 g/mol = 5.15 mol\nNitrogen: 28.85 g / 14.01 g/mol = 2.06 mol\n\nNow, we will divide each mole value by the smallest mole value to get the mole ratio:\nCarbon: 4.12 mol / 2.06 mol = 2.00\nHydrogen: 5.15 mol / 2.06 mol = 2.50\nNitrogen: 2.06 mol / 2.06 mol = 1.00\n\nSince the mole ratio for hydrogen is not a whole number, we can multiply all the mole ratios by 2 to get whole numbers:\nCarbon: 2.00 × 2 = 4\nHydrogen: 2.50 × 2 = 5\nNitrogen: 1.00 × 2 = 2\n\nSo, the empirical formula for caffeine is C4H5N2. However, this empirical formula does not match the molecular formula of caffeine (C8H10N4O2). This is because the empirical formula represents the simplest whole number ratio of elements in a compound, while the molecular formula represents the actual number of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. In this case, the empirical formula is a simplified version of the molecular formula."
