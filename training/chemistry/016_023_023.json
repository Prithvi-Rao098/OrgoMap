    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of magnesium bromide, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nMgBr2 (s) + 2H2O (l) → MgO (s) + 2HBr (aq)\n\nNext, we will use Hess's Law, which states that the enthalpy change of a reaction is the sum of the enthalpy changes of formation of the products minus the sum of the enthalpy changes of formation of the reactants.\n\nΔH(reaction) = Σ ΔHf(products) - Σ ΔHf(reactants)\n\nFor this reaction, the enthalpy change of formation for MgO is given as -601.6 kJ/mol, and for HBr, it is -36.3 kJ/mol. Since there is no enthalpy change of formation for elements in their standard state (MgBr2 and H2O), we can calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction as follows:\n\nΔH(reaction) = [1 × (-601.6) + 2 × (-36.3)] - [0 + 0]\nΔH(reaction) = (-601.6 - 72.6) kJ/mol\nΔH(reaction) = -674.2 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we need to find the enthalpy change for 2 moles of MgBr2:\n\nΔH(2 moles) = 2 × (-674.2) kJ\nΔH(2 moles) = -1348.4 kJ\n\nSo, the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 2 moles of magnesium bromide in water is -1348.4 kJ."
