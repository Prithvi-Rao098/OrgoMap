    "message_2": "One surface modification technique that can be utilized to enhance the biocompatibility of titanium implants for bone tissue engineering applications is the incorporation of bioactive coatings. These coatings can be composed of materials such as hydroxyapatite (HA), calcium phosphate, or bioactive glass. These materials promote osseointegration, which is the direct structural and functional connection between living bone and the surface of the implant. This can be achieved through various methods, including plasma spraying, electrochemical deposition, sol-gel techniques, and biomimetic deposition. By modifying the surface of titanium implants with these bioactive coatings, the biocompatibility and overall performance of the implant can be significantly improved, leading to better clinical outcomes in bone tissue engineering applications."
