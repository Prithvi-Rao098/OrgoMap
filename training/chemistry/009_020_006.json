    "message_2": "Isotopic labeling is a technique used in organic chemistry to study reaction mechanisms by replacing specific atoms in a molecule with their isotopes. These isotopes have the same chemical properties as their non-isotopic counterparts but differ in mass. This difference in mass allows chemists to track the movement of atoms during a reaction using various analytical techniques such as mass spectrometry or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.\n\nBy comparing the products formed from reactions with isotopically labeled reactants to those formed from non-labeled reactants, chemists can gain insights into the reaction mechanism, including the order of bond formation and cleavage, the intermediates involved, and the overall reaction pathway.\n\nOne classic example of using isotopic labeling to determine a reaction mechanism is the study of the SN1 and SN2 mechanisms in nucleophilic substitution reactions. In these reactions, a nucleophile attacks a substrate containing a leaving group, resulting in the substitution of the leaving group with the nucleophile.\n\nFor example, consider the reaction between bromoethane (CH3CH2Br) and a nucleophile (Nu). If the bromine atom in bromoethane is replaced with its isotope, 81Br, the isotopically labeled compound CH3CH281Br can be used to study the reaction mechanism.\n\nIn an SN1 reaction, the reaction proceeds through a carbocation intermediate, and the rate-determining step involves the cleavage of the C-Br bond. If the reaction follows the SN1 mechanism, the isotopic label (81Br) will be found in the leaving group (Br-) and not in the product (CH3CH2Nu).\n\nIn an SN2 reaction, the reaction proceeds through a concerted mechanism, with the nucleophile attacking the substrate simultaneously as the leaving group departs. If the reaction follows the SN2 mechanism, the isotopic label (81Br) will be found in the leaving group (Br-) and the product (CH3CH2Nu) will also contain the isotopic label, as the nucleophile directly replaces the labeled leaving group.\n\nBy analyzing the products and comparing the distribution of the isotopic label, chemists can determine whether the reaction proceeds through an SN1 or SN2 mechanism. In this example, if the isotopic label is found only in the leaving group and not in the product, it suggests an SN1 mechanism. If the isotopic label is found in both the leaving group and the product, it suggests an SN2 mechanism."
