    "message_2": "To determine the optimum amount of chlorine gas required for the preparation of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nC6H5COOH + 2Cl2 → C6H3Cl2COOH + 2HCl\n\nNow, we need to calculate the moles of benzoic acid and chlorine gas:\n\nBenzoic acid (C6H5COOH) has a molar mass of 122.12 g/mol.\n10 g of benzoic acid / 122.12 g/mol = 0.0819 moles of benzoic acid\n\nAccording to the balanced equation, 1 mole of benzoic acid reacts with 2 moles of chlorine gas. So, we need:\n\n0.0819 moles of benzoic acid × 2 moles of Cl2 / 1 mole of benzoic acid = 0.1638 moles of Cl2\n\nNow, we can convert moles of Cl2 to grams:\n\nChlorine gas (Cl2) has a molar mass of 70.90 g/mol.\n0.1638 moles of Cl2 × 70.90 g/mol = 11.62 g of Cl2\n\nSo, the optimum amount of chlorine gas required for the preparation of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid when starting with 10 grams of benzoic acid is 11.62 grams.\n\nTo determine the percentage yield of the reaction, we need to know the actual yield of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid obtained from the reaction. Let's assume the actual yield is 'x' grams.\n\nPercentage yield = (Actual yield / Theoretical yield) × 100\n\nThe theoretical yield can be calculated by finding the moles of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid produced and converting it to grams:\n\n0.0819 moles of benzoic acid × 1 mole of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid / 1 mole of benzoic acid = 0.0819 moles of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid\n\n2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid (C6H3Cl2COOH) has a molar mass of 191.00 g/mol.\n0.0819 moles of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid × 191.00 g/mol = 15.64 g of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid (theoretical yield)\n\nPercentage yield = (x / 15.64) × 100\n\nWithout the actual yield, we cannot determine the percentage yield of the reaction."
