    "message_2": "To predict which substance would have a higher boiling point, we need to consider the intermolecular forces present in each substance. The primary intermolecular force in both methane (CH4) and ethane (C2H6) is London dispersion forces, which are temporary attractive forces due to the random movement of electrons.\n\nIn general, the strength of London dispersion forces increases with the size and mass of the molecule. Since ethane (C2H6) is larger and has a greater molecular mass than methane (CH4), it will have stronger London dispersion forces. As a result, more energy is required to overcome these forces in ethane, leading to a higher boiling point compared to methane."
