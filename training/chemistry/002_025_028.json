    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic moment of a tetrahedral complex with four ligands, each containing one unpaired electron, coordinated to a central transition metal ion with a d⁴ electron configuration, we first need to determine the total number of unpaired electrons in the complex.\n\nFor the central transition metal ion with a d⁴ electron configuration, there are 4 unpaired electrons.\n\nFor the four ligands, each containing one unpaired electron, there are 4 unpaired electrons in total.\n\nSo, the total number of unpaired electrons in the complex is 4 (from the central metal ion) + 4 (from the ligands) = 8 unpaired electrons.\n\nThe magnetic moment (μ) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nμ = √(n(n+2))\n\nwhere n is the number of unpaired electrons.\n\nIn this case, n = 8, so:\n\nμ = √(8(8+2))\nμ = √(8(10))\nμ = √(80)\n\nThe magnetic moment of the tetrahedral complex is √80 Bohr magnetons."
