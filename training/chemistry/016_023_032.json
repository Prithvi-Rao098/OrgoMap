    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of sucrose, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nC12H22O11 (s) + H2O (l) → C6H12O6 (s) + C6H12O6 (s)\n\nSucrose + Water → Glucose + Fructose\n\nNext, we need the standard enthalpy of formation values for each compound involved in the reaction:\n\nΔHf° (C12H22O11) = -2221 kJ/mol\nΔHf° (H2O) = -285.8 kJ/mol\nΔHf° (C6H12O6) = -1273.3 kJ/mol (both glucose and fructose have the same value)\n\nNow, we can use Hess's Law to calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nΔH° = Σ [ΔHf° (products)] - Σ [ΔHf° (reactants)]\n\nΔH° = [(2 × -1273.3) - (-2221 + (-285.8))]\n\nΔH° = -2546.6 + 2506.8\n\nΔH° = -39.8 kJ/mol\n\nNow that we have the enthalpy change per mole of sucrose, we need to determine the number of moles of sucrose in 5.5 grams:\n\nMolar mass of sucrose (C12H22O11) = 12(12.01) + 22(1.01) + 11(16.00) = 342.3 g/mol\n\nmoles of sucrose = 5.5 g / 342.3 g/mol = 0.0161 mol\n\nFinally, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 5.5 grams of sucrose:\n\nΔH = ΔH° × moles of sucrose\n\nΔH = -39.8 kJ/mol × 0.0161 mol\n\nΔH = -0.641 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 5.5 grams of sucrose is approximately -0.641 kJ."
