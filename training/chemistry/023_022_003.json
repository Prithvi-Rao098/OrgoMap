    "message_2": "To prepare 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid from benzoic acid and nitric acid, you can follow the following step-by-step procedure:\n\n1. Reagents and materials:\n   - Benzoic acid (starting material)\n   - Concentrated nitric acid (HNO3, nitrating agent)\n   - Concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4, catalyst)\n   - Ice bath\n   - Round-bottom flask\n   - Separatory funnel\n   - Vacuum filtration apparatus\n   - Recrystallization solvent (e.g., hot ethanol)\n\n2. Reaction setup:\n   - Set up a round-bottom flask in an ice bath to keep the reaction temperature low.\n   - Add benzoic acid to the flask.\n\n3. Nitrating mixture preparation:\n   - In a separate container, slowly mix equal volumes of concentrated nitric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid. This mixture is highly corrosive and should be prepared carefully.\n\n4. Nitration reaction:\n   - Slowly add the nitrating mixture to the benzoic acid in the round-bottom flask while stirring. The reaction is exothermic, so it is essential to maintain the temperature below 10Â°C to avoid side reactions and decomposition of the nitro groups.\n   - After the addition is complete, continue stirring the reaction mixture for an additional 30 minutes to ensure complete nitration.\n\n5. Quenching and extraction:\n   - Carefully pour the reaction mixture into a separatory funnel containing ice-cold water to quench the reaction and dilute the acids.\n   - Shake the separatory funnel to mix the organic and aqueous layers. Allow the layers to separate, and then drain the aqueous layer.\n   - Extract the organic layer with a suitable solvent, such as ethyl acetate or dichloromethane, to remove any unreacted benzoic acid and other impurities.\n\n6. Purification:\n   - Collect the crude 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid by vacuum filtration.\n   - Recrystallize the crude product from hot ethanol to obtain pure 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid. Allow the solution to cool slowly to room temperature and then cool further in an ice bath to promote crystal formation. Collect the purified product by vacuum filtration and allow it to dry.\n\n7. Analytical techniques to confirm identity and purity:\n   - Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) can be used to check the purity of the product and monitor the progress of the reaction.\n   - Melting point determination can be used to assess the purity and confirm the identity of the synthesized compound by comparing it to the known melting point of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid.\n   - Infrared (IR) spectroscopy can be used to confirm the presence of nitro groups and the aromatic ring in the product.\n   - Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) and carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR) spectroscopy can be used to confirm the structure of the synthesized compound.\n   - Elemental analysis or high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) can be used to determine the molecular formula and confirm the identity of the product."
