    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the dissolution of 5 g of sodium chloride (NaCl) in water, we first need to determine the number of moles of NaCl in 5 g.\n\nThe molar mass of NaCl is approximately 58.44 g/mol (22.99 g/mol for Na + 35.45 g/mol for Cl).\n\nNumber of moles of NaCl = (mass of NaCl) / (molar mass of NaCl)\nNumber of moles of NaCl = 5 g / 58.44 g/mol ≈ 0.0856 mol\n\nNow, we can use the enthalpy of dissolution of NaCl in water to find the standard enthalpy change for the dissolution of 5 g of NaCl.\n\nStandard enthalpy change = (number of moles of NaCl) × (enthalpy of dissolution of NaCl)\nStandard enthalpy change = 0.0856 mol × (-3.9 kJ/mol) ≈ -0.333 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the dissolution of 5 g of sodium chloride (NaCl) in water is approximately -0.333 kJ."
