    "message_2": "The vibrational frequency of the C-H bonds in methane (CH4) is approximately 3000 cm⁻¹ (wavenumbers). This value can vary slightly depending on the specific sample and measurement conditions. Infrared spectroscopy is used to study the vibrational frequencies of molecules, as these frequencies correspond to the energy levels that can be absorbed by the molecule when it interacts with infrared radiation.\n\nTo relate the vibrational frequency to the wavelength of the radiation absorbed, we can use the following equation:\n\nv = c / λ\n\nwhere v is the vibrational frequency, c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^10 cm/s in vacuum), and λ is the wavelength of the radiation absorbed.\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for λ, we get:\n\nλ = c / v\n\nPlugging in the values for the vibrational frequency of the C-H bond in methane (3000 cm⁻¹) and the speed of light, we get:\n\nλ = (2.998 x 10^10 cm/s) / (3000 cm⁻¹) = 9.993 x 10^6 cm\n\nConverting this value to micrometers (µm), we get:\n\nλ = 9.993 x 10^6 cm * (1 µm / 10^4 cm) = 999.3 µm\n\nSo, the wavelength of the radiation absorbed by the C-H bonds in methane during infrared spectroscopy is approximately 999.3 µm."
