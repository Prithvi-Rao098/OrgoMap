    "message_2": "In a molecule of ethane (C2H6), a single covalent bond is formed between the two carbon atoms. This bond is determined by the sharing of a pair of electrons between the carbon atoms. Each carbon atom contributes one electron to the shared pair, resulting in a stable electron configuration for both atoms. Additionally, each carbon atom forms three single covalent bonds with three hydrogen atoms, completing the molecular structure of ethane."
