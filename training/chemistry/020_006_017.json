    "message_1": "What is the effect of increasing the temperature on the equilibrium constant of the reaction N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g)? If the initial concentration of N2 is 0.2 M and H2 is 0.1 M, calculate the new concentration of NH3 after increasing the temperature of the system from 25°C to 35°C. The equilibrium constant at 25°C is 4x10^3. (Assume that the reaction is exothermic and that the activation energy of the forward reaction is greater than that of the reverse reaction.)",
    "message_2": "For an exothermic reaction, increasing the temperature will shift the equilibrium position to favor the reverse reaction (endothermic direction). This means that the equilibrium constant (K) will decrease as the temperature increases.\n\nTo calculate the new concentration of NH3 after increasing the temperature, we first need to find the new equilibrium constant (K') at 35°C. We can use the Van't Hoff equation to relate the change in temperature to the change in the equilibrium constant:\n\nln(K'/K) = -ΔH°/R * (1/T' - 1/T)\n\nHowever, we don't have the enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the reaction. Without this information, we cannot directly calculate the new equilibrium constant (K') at 35°C.\n\nIf we had the new equilibrium constant, we could then use the initial concentrations of N2 and H2 and the stoichiometry of the reaction to set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the new concentration of NH3 at equilibrium."
