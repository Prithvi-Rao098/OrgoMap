    "message_2": "The reaction between copper (II) sulfate (CuSO₄) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is a double displacement reaction, resulting in the formation of copper (II) hydroxide (Cu(OH)₂) and sodium sulfate (Na₂SO₄). The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nCuSO₄ (aq) + 2 NaOH (aq) → Cu(OH)₂ (s) + Na₂SO₄ (aq)"
