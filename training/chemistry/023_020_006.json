    "message_2": "To determine the maximum yield of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid, we first need to find the limiting reactant in the reaction. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nC6H5COOH + 2 Cl2 → C6H3Cl2COOH + 2 HCl\n\nFirst, let's find the moles of benzoic acid (C6H5COOH) and chlorine gas (Cl2) used in the reaction.\n\nMolar mass of benzoic acid (C6H5COOH) = 12.01 * 7 + 1.01 * 6 + 16.00 * 2 = 122.12 g/mol\nMoles of benzoic acid = (10 g) / (122.12 g/mol) = 0.0819 mol\n\nSince the reaction flask has a volume of 500 mL, we need to find the moles of chlorine gas (Cl2) that can be present in the flask. Assuming the reaction is carried out at room temperature (25°C) and atmospheric pressure (1 atm), we can use the ideal gas law to find the moles of Cl2:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nwhere P = pressure (1 atm), V = volume (0.5 L), n = moles of Cl2, R = ideal gas constant (0.0821 L atm/mol K), and T = temperature (298 K).\n\nn = PV / RT = (1 atm * 0.5 L) / (0.0821 L atm/mol K * 298 K) = 0.0204 mol\n\nNow, we need to determine the limiting reactant. The stoichiometry of the reaction shows that 1 mole of benzoic acid reacts with 2 moles of Cl2. Therefore, we need 0.0819 * 2 = 0.1638 mol of Cl2 to react with all the benzoic acid. Since we only have 0.0204 mol of Cl2, Cl2 is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow, we can calculate the maximum yield of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid (C6H3Cl2COOH) using the stoichiometry of the reaction:\n\nMoles of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid = (0.0204 mol Cl2) * (1 mol C6H3Cl2COOH / 2 mol Cl2) = 0.0102 mol\n\nMolar mass of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid (C6H3Cl2COOH) = 12.01 * 7 + 1.01 * 3 + 16.00 * 2 + 35.45 * 2 = 197.02 g/mol\nMaximum yield of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid = (0.0102 mol) * (197.02 g/mol) = 2.01 g\n\nTherefore, the maximum yield of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid that can be obtained when preparing it from benzoic acid and chlorine gas using a reaction flask with a volume of 500 mL and a starting amount of 10 g of benzoic acid is 2.01 g."
