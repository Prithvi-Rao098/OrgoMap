    "message_1": "A sealed vessel contains a mixture of nitrogen dioxide and dinitrogen tetraoxide gases in equilibrium. If the volume of the container is increased, would the equilibrium shift towards more or less NO2? Calculate the new equilibrium constant at the new volume assuming the pressure and temperature remain constant.",
    "message_2": "The equilibrium reaction between nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4) can be represented as follows:\n\n2 NO2 (g) â‡Œ N2O4 (g)\n\nTo determine the direction of the equilibrium shift when the volume of the container is increased, we can use Le Chatelier's principle. According to this principle, if a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in conditions, the system will adjust itself to counteract the change and restore a new equilibrium.\n\nIn this case, when the volume of the container is increased, the pressure of the system decreases. Since there are more moles of gas on the left side of the equation (2 moles of NO2) than on the right side (1 mole of N2O4), the equilibrium will shift towards the side with more moles of gas to counteract the decrease in pressure. Therefore, the equilibrium will shift towards more NO2.\n\nNow, let's calculate the new equilibrium constant at the new volume. Since the temperature remains constant, the equilibrium constant (K) will not change. This is because the equilibrium constant is only affected by changes in temperature.\n\nIn conclusion, when the volume of the container is increased, the equilibrium will shift towards more NO2, but the equilibrium constant will remain the same as long as the temperature remains constant."
