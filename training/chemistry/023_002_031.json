    "message_2": "To calculate the theoretical yield of benzocaine, we need to first determine the limiting reagent in the reaction. We will do this by calculating the moles of each reactant and comparing their mole ratios.\n\n1. Calculate the moles of p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) and ethanol:\n\nMolecular weight of PABA = 137.14 g/mol (C7H7NO2)\nMolecular weight of ethanol = 46.07 g/mol (C2H5OH)\n\nGiven: 5 grams of PABA and 25 mL of ethanol\nDensity of ethanol = 0.789 g/mL\n\nMass of ethanol = volume × density = 25 mL × 0.789 g/mL = 19.725 g\n\nNow, we can calculate the moles of each reactant:\n\nMoles of PABA = mass / molecular weight = 5 g / 137.14 g/mol = 0.0364 mol\nMoles of ethanol = mass / molecular weight = 19.725 g / 46.07 g/mol = 0.428 mol\n\n2. Determine the limiting reagent:\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the synthesis of benzocaine from PABA and ethanol is:\n\nPABA + C2H5OH → C9H11NO2 + H2O\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that the mole ratio of PABA to ethanol is 1:1.\n\nMole ratio of PABA to ethanol in the reaction mixture = 0.0364 mol / 0.428 mol = 0.085\n\nSince the mole ratio is less than 1, PABA is the limiting reagent.\n\n3. Calculate the theoretical yield of benzocaine:\n\nMolecular weight of benzocaine = 165.19 g/mol (C9H11NO2)\n\nUsing the moles of the limiting reagent (PABA), we can calculate the moles of benzocaine produced:\n\nMoles of benzocaine = moles of PABA = 0.0364 mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the theoretical yield of benzocaine:\n\nTheoretical yield = moles of benzocaine × molecular weight of benzocaine\nTheoretical yield = 0.0364 mol × 165.19 g/mol = 6.01 g\n\nTherefore, the theoretical yield of benzocaine that can be obtained from the reaction is 6.01 grams, assuming a complete reaction and 100% yield."
