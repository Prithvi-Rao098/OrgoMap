    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the electrochemical reduction of 1 mol of Au3+ to Au, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG = -nFE\n\nwhere:\n- n is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the redox reaction (in this case, 3 moles of electrons, as Au3+ gains 3 electrons to become Au)\n- F is the Faraday constant (approximately 96,485 C/mol)\n- E is the cell potential (1.42 V)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate ΔG:\n\nΔG = -(3 mol)(96,485 C/mol)(1.42 V)\n\nΔG = -411,293.62 J/mol\n\nSince the value is negative, the reaction is spontaneous under standard conditions. The Gibbs free energy change for the electrochemical reduction of 1 mol of Au3+ to Au in a standard electrochemical cell with a cell potential of 1.42 V at 298 K is approximately -411,293.62 J/mol."
