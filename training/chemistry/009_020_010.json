    "message_2": "Isotopic labeling in chemistry is a technique that involves the substitution of one or more atoms in a molecule with their isotopes, which are atoms of the same element but with a different number of neutrons. This allows chemists to track the movement of atoms during a chemical reaction, providing valuable information about the reaction mechanism, intermediates, and transition states.\n\nAn example of a specific reaction that can be studied using isotopic labeling is the SN2 reaction between bromoethane (CH3CH2Br) and the cyanide ion (CN-). In this reaction, the cyanide ion attacks the carbon atom bonded to the bromine atom, leading to the formation of ethanenitrile (CH3CH2CN) and a bromide ion (Br-).\n\nTo study the mechanism of this reaction, we can use isotopic labeling by replacing the hydrogen atoms in bromoethane with deuterium atoms (D), a heavier isotope of hydrogen. This results in the labeled compound CD3CD2Br. When the labeled bromoethane reacts with the cyanide ion, we can analyze the products to determine the distribution of deuterium atoms.\n\nIf the reaction proceeds through an SN2 mechanism, we would expect the cyanide ion to attack the carbon atom bonded to the bromine atom directly, resulting in the formation of CD3CD2CN with the deuterium atoms remaining on the carbon atoms. If the reaction proceeds through an SN1 mechanism, we would expect the bromine atom to leave first, forming a carbocation intermediate, followed by the attack of the cyanide ion. In this case, we might observe a mixture of products with different distributions of deuterium atoms due to the possibility of rearrangement of the carbocation intermediate.\n\nBy analyzing the products of the reaction and determining the distribution of deuterium atoms, we can gain valuable information about the mechanism of the reaction. If the products show that the deuterium atoms remain on the carbon atoms as in the case of CD3CD2CN, this would support the SN2 mechanism. If the products show a mixture of different distributions of deuterium atoms, this would suggest an SN1 mechanism or other possible pathways.\n\nIn summary, isotopic labeling is a powerful tool in chemistry that allows us to track the movement of atoms during a reaction, providing valuable information about reaction mechanisms and helping us to better understand the underlying processes involved in chemical reactions."
