    "message_2": "The balanced chemical equation for the reaction between nitrogen gas (N2) and hydrogen gas (H2) to form ammonia (NH3) is:\n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g)\n\nGiven the initial moles of N2 and H2, we can calculate the initial concentrations:\n\n[N2] = 0.50 moles / 1.00 L = 0.50 M\n[H2] = 0.50 moles / 1.00 L = 0.50 M\n[NH3] = 0 moles / 1.00 L = 0 M (since no NH3 is present initially)\n\nLet x be the change in concentration of N2 and H2 at equilibrium. Then, the change in concentration of NH3 will be 2x. The equilibrium concentrations will be:\n\n[N2] = 0.50 - x\n[H2] = 0.50 - 3x\n[NH3] = 2x\n\nNow, we can use the given Kc value to set up the equilibrium expression:\n\nKc = [NH3]^2 / ([N2] * [H2]^3) = 0.129\n\nSubstitute the equilibrium concentrations into the expression:\n\n0.129 = (2x)^2 / ((0.50 - x) * (0.50 - 3x)^3)\n\nThis is a complex cubic equation that can be solved either by numerical methods or by using a specialized calculator or software. Solving for x, we get:\n\nx ≈ 0.042\n\nNow, we can find the equilibrium concentrations:\n\n[N2] = 0.50 - x ≈ 0.50 - 0.042 ≈ 0.458 M\n[H2] = 0.50 - 3x ≈ 0.50 - 3(0.042) ≈ 0.374 M\n[NH3] = 2x ≈ 2(0.042) ≈ 0.084 M\n\nSo, the equilibrium concentrations are approximately:\n\n[N2] ≈ 0.458 M\n[H2] ≈ 0.374 M\n[NH3] ≈ 0.084 M"
