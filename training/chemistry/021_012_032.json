    "message_2": "The bond strength of a nitrogen molecule (N2) can be represented by its bond dissociation energy, which is the energy required to break the bond between the two nitrogen atoms. The bond dissociation energy of N2 is approximately 941 kJ/mol.\n\nThe nitrogen molecule (N2) consists of two nitrogen atoms that are connected by a triple bond. This triple bond is made up of one sigma (σ) bond and two pi (π) bonds. The presence of a triple bond indicates a strong bond between the two nitrogen atoms, which is why the bond dissociation energy is relatively high.\n\nThe bond strength can be attributed to the bond type present in the molecule. In N2, the triple bond is formed due to the overlapping of atomic orbitals between the two nitrogen atoms. The sigma bond is formed by the end-to-end overlap of the sp-hybridized orbitals, while the two pi bonds are formed by the side-to-side overlap of the unhybridized p orbitals. The presence of these multiple bonds results in a strong bond between the nitrogen atoms, leading to a high bond dissociation energy."
