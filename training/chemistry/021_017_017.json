    "message_2": "In methanol (CH3OH), the primary type of intermolecular force present is hydrogen bonding. This is due to the presence of the highly polar O-H bond, which allows for strong attractive forces between the partially positive hydrogen atom and the partially negative oxygen atom of neighboring molecules. Additionally, there are also weaker London dispersion forces and dipole-dipole interactions present."
