    "message_2": "To determine the percent composition of oxygen in a sample of an unknown compound using elemental analysis, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Obtain the sample of the unknown compound.\n2. Perform elemental analysis on the sample to determine the mass of each element present in the compound.\n3. Calculate the molar mass of the compound using the masses of the elements and their respective molar masses.\n4. Calculate the percent composition of oxygen in the compound.\n\nHowever, without the specific data from the elemental analysis or the identity of the unknown compound, it is impossible to provide the exact percent composition of oxygen. Please provide the necessary information to proceed with the calculations."
