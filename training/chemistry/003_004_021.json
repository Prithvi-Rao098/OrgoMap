    "message_2": "To determine the maximum amount of electrical energy that can be produced by a Daniell cell, we need to calculate the cell potential (E_cell) and use the Nernst equation. The Daniell cell consists of a copper electrode in a CuSO4 solution and a zinc electrode in a ZnSO4 solution.\n\nUnder standard conditions (25°C, 1.0 M concentration, and 1 atm pressure), the half-cell reactions and their standard reduction potentials (E°) are:\n\nCu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Cu(s)    E°(Cu²⁺/Cu) = +0.34 V\nZn²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Zn(s)    E°(Zn²⁺/Zn) = -0.76 V\n\nThe overall cell reaction is obtained by combining the two half-cell reactions:\n\nCu²⁺(aq) + Zn(s) → Cu(s) + Zn²⁺(aq)\n\nTo calculate the cell potential (E_cell) under standard conditions, we use the following equation:\n\nE_cell = E°(cathode) - E°(anode)\n\nIn this case, the copper half-cell acts as the cathode, and the zinc half-cell acts as the anode. Therefore:\n\nE_cell = E°(Cu²⁺/Cu) - E°(Zn²⁺/Zn) = (+0.34 V) - (-0.76 V) = +1.10 V\n\nSince the concentrations of CuSO4 and ZnSO4 are both 1.0 M, which are the standard conditions, we don't need to use the Nernst equation to adjust the cell potential.\n\nNow, to find the maximum amount of electrical energy that can be produced by the Daniell cell, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG = -nFE_cell\n\nwhere ΔG is the Gibbs free energy, n is the number of moles of electrons transferred, F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol), and E_cell is the cell potential.\n\nIn the Daniell cell, the number of moles of electrons transferred (n) is 2, as seen in the half-cell reactions. Therefore:\n\nΔG = -2 * 96,485 C/mol * 1.10 V = -212,267 J/mol\n\nThe maximum amount of electrical energy that can be produced by the Daniell cell under the given conditions is 212,267 J/mol."
