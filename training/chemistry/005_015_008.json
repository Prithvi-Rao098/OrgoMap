    "message_2": "The net gain of ATP molecules produced during one turn of the Citric Acid Cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle) and through oxidative phosphorylation in eukaryotic cells is approximately 12 ATP molecules. Here's a breakdown of how each step contributes to the overall production of ATP:\n\n1. During one turn of the Citric Acid Cycle, one molecule of Acetyl-CoA is oxidized, producing 3 molecules of NADH, 1 molecule of FADH2, and 1 molecule of GTP (which can be converted to ATP). So, the direct production of ATP in the Citric Acid Cycle is 1 ATP molecule.\n\n2. The 3 NADH molecules produced in the Citric Acid Cycle are used in the electron transport chain (ETC) during oxidative phosphorylation. Each NADH molecule generates approximately 2.5 ATP molecules through the ETC, resulting in a total of 7.5 ATP molecules (3 NADH x 2.5 ATP/NADH).\n\n3. The 1 FADH2 molecule produced in the Citric Acid Cycle also participates in the ETC during oxidative phosphorylation. Each FADH2 molecule generates approximately 1.5 ATP molecules through the ETC, resulting in a total of 1.5 ATP molecules (1 FADH2 x 1.5 ATP/FADH2).\n\n4. Adding the ATP molecules produced directly in the Citric Acid Cycle (1 ATP) and those generated through oxidative phosphorylation (7.5 ATP from NADH + 1.5 ATP from FADH2), the net gain of ATP molecules during one turn of the Citric Acid Cycle and through oxidative phosphorylation in eukaryotic cells is approximately 12 ATP molecules."
