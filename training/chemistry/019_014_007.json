    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the precipitation reaction, we can use the following formula:\n\nΔH_reaction = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nAgNO3(aq) + NaCl(aq) → AgCl(s) + NaNO3(aq)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for the molar enthalpy of formation for each compound:\n\nΔH_reaction = [(-127.01 kJ/mol) + (-468.35 kJ/mol)] - [(-123.61 kJ/mol) + (-407.33 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH_reaction = (-595.36 kJ/mol) - (-530.94 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH_reaction = -64.42 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the precipitation reaction between silver nitrate and sodium chloride to form silver chloride and sodium nitrate is -64.42 kJ/mol."
