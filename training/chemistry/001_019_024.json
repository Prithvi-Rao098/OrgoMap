    "message_2": "The reaction between 2-bromo-2-methylpropane (tert-butyl bromide) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in ethanol is a nucleophilic substitution reaction. Since 2-bromo-2-methylpropane is a tertiary alkyl halide, the reaction follows an SN1 (Substitution Nucleophilic Unimolecular) mechanism.\n\nHere's a step-by-step description of the mechanism:\n\n1. Ionization: The bond between the carbon and bromine in 2-bromo-2-methylpropane breaks, resulting in the formation of a tertiary carbocation (tert-butyl cation) and a bromide ion (Br-). This step is the slow, rate-determining step of the reaction.\n\n2. Nucleophilic attack: The hydroxide ion (OH-) from sodium hydroxide acts as a nucleophile and attacks the positively charged carbon in the tert-butyl cation. This step is relatively fast.\n\n3. Formation of the product: The nucleophilic attack results in the formation of 2-methyl-2-propanol (tert-butyl alcohol) as the major product.\n\nOverall, the reaction can be summarized as:\n\n(CH3)3C-Br + NaOH â†’ (CH3)3C-OH + NaBr\n\nThe product of the substitution reaction between 2-bromo-2-methylpropane and sodium hydroxide in ethanol is 2-methyl-2-propanol (tert-butyl alcohol)."
