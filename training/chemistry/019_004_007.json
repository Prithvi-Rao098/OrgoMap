    "message_2": "To find the standard molar entropy change (ΔS°) for the reaction, we need to subtract the sum of the entropies of the reactants from the sum of the entropies of the products:\n\nΔS° = ΣS°(products) - ΣS°(reactants)\n\nFor the given reaction, H2(g) + O2(g) → H2O(l), the entropies of the reactants and products are given as:\n\nS°[H2(g)] = 130.7 J/mol K\nS°[O2(g)] = 205.0 J/mol K\nS°[H2O(l)] = 69.9 J/mol K\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard molar entropy change:\n\nΔS° = S°[H2O(l)] - (S°[H2(g)] + S°[O2(g)])\nΔS° = 69.9 J/mol K - (130.7 J/mol K + 205.0 J/mol K)\nΔS° = 69.9 J/mol K - 335.7 J/mol K\nΔS° = -265.8 J/mol K\n\nSo, the standard molar entropy change for the reaction at 298 K is -265.8 J/mol K."
