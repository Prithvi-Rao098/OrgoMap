    "message_1": "A chemistry student wants to determine the percentage of ethanol in a sample of wine. The student takes a 50 mL aliquot of the wine, dries it, and finds the weight of the residual solids to be 0.325 g. The student then distills the rest of the wine, evaporates the distillate to dryness, and finds the weight of the residue to be 2.324 g. Using mass balance calculations, what is the percentage of ethanol in the wine sample?",
    "message_2": "To determine the percentage of ethanol in the wine sample, we need to calculate the mass of ethanol and then divide it by the total mass of the wine sample.\n\nFirst, let's find the mass of the wine sample. We know the mass of the residual solids (0.325 g) and the mass of the residue after distillation (2.324 g). The mass of the wine sample can be calculated as follows:\n\nMass of wine sample = Mass of residual solids + Mass of residue after distillation\nMass of wine sample = 0.325 g + 2.324 g\nMass of wine sample = 2.649 g\n\nNow, we need to find the mass of ethanol in the wine sample. Since the residue after distillation is the mass of the ethanol, we can use this value:\n\nMass of ethanol = 2.324 g\n\nFinally, we can calculate the percentage of ethanol in the wine sample:\n\nPercentage of ethanol = (Mass of ethanol / Mass of wine sample) * 100\nPercentage of ethanol = (2.324 g / 2.649 g) * 100\nPercentage of ethanol â‰ˆ 87.7%\n\nTherefore, the percentage of ethanol in the wine sample is approximately 87.7%."
