    "message_2": "To calculate the rate of electroplating, we can use the formula:\n\nRate of electroplating = (Mass of metal deposited) / (Current × Time)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the time to seconds:\n\n1 hour = 60 minutes × 60 seconds/minute = 3600 seconds\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nRate of electroplating = (0.456 g) / (2.5 A × 3600 s)\n\nRate of electroplating = 0.456 g / 9000 As\n\nRate of electroplating = 0.00005067 g/As\n\nThe rate of electroplating in the cell is 0.00005067 g/As."
