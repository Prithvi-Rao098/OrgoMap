    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant (K) for the given electrochemical reaction, we can use the Nernst equation. The Nernst equation relates the reduction potential of a half-cell (E) to the standard reduction potential (E°), temperature (T), and concentrations of the species involved in the reaction. The equation is:\n\n$$E = E° - \\frac{RT}{nF} \\ln Q$$\n\nWhere:\n- E is the reduction potential of the half-cell\n- E° is the standard reduction potential (-0.28 V in this case)\n- R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\n- T is the temperature in Kelvin (25°C = 298.15 K)\n- n is the number of electrons transferred in the half-reaction (2 in this case)\n- F is the Faraday constant (96485 C/mol)\n- Q is the reaction quotient, which is equal to the equilibrium constant (K) at equilibrium\n\nAt equilibrium, the reduction potential (E) is zero. Therefore, we can rearrange the Nernst equation to solve for K:\n\n$$0 = -0.28 - \\frac{8.314 \\times 298.15}{2 \\times 96485} \\ln K$$\n\nSolving for K:\n\n$$\\ln K = \\frac{-0.28 \\times 2 \\times 96485}{8.314 \\times 298.15}$$\n$$K = e^{\\frac{-0.28 \\times 2 \\times 96485}{8.314 \\times 298.15}}$$\n$$K \\approx 1.1 \\times 10^6$$\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant for the given electrochemical reaction is approximately $1.1 \\times 10^6$."
