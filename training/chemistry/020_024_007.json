    "message_1": "What effect will the addition of a catalyst have on the equilibrium position of a redox reaction between iron (Fe) and copper (Cu)? Calculate the change in the equilibrium constant (Kc) when a catalyst is added to the reaction mixture at constant temperature and pressure.",
    "message_2": "The addition of a catalyst to a reaction does not affect the equilibrium position or the equilibrium constant (Kc) of the reaction. Catalysts work by lowering the activation energy of a reaction, which speeds up both the forward and reverse reactions equally. As a result, the reaction reaches equilibrium faster, but the equilibrium position and Kc remain unchanged.\n\nIn the case of the redox reaction between iron (Fe) and copper (Cu), adding a catalyst will not change the equilibrium constant (Kc) or the equilibrium position. The reaction will simply reach equilibrium more quickly."
