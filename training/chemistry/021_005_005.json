    "message_2": "To determine the polarity of the carbon-oxygen bond in a carbon dioxide (CO2) molecule, we need to consider the electronegativity values of carbon and oxygen atoms.\n\nElectronegativity is a measure of the tendency of an atom to attract a bonding pair of electrons. The Pauling scale is the most commonly used scale for electronegativity values. On this scale, the electronegativity values for carbon and oxygen are:\n\n- Carbon (C): 2.55\n- Oxygen (O): 3.44\n\nThe difference in electronegativity values between carbon and oxygen is:\n\nΔEN = |3.44 - 2.55| = 0.89\n\nA bond is considered polar if the electronegativity difference (ΔEN) is between 0.5 and 1.7. Since the electronegativity difference between carbon and oxygen in CO2 is 0.89, the carbon-oxygen bond is polar.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the CO2 molecule as a whole is nonpolar. This is because CO2 has a linear molecular geometry, with two oxygen atoms symmetrically bonded to the central carbon atom. The polarities of the two carbon-oxygen bonds cancel each other out, resulting in a nonpolar molecule."
