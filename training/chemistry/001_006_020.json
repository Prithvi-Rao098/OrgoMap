    "message_2": "When 1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane is treated with sodium ethoxide, the product obtained is 1-ethoxy-2-methylcyclohexane. This reaction occurs through an SN2 mechanism.\n\nHere's why it forms that product:\n\n1. Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) is a strong base and a good nucleophile. In this reaction, it acts as a nucleophile.\n\n2. The nucleophile (ethoxide ion) attacks the electrophilic carbon (the one bonded to the bromine) in the 1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane molecule. This carbon is electrophilic because the carbon-bromine bond is polar, with the carbon being partially positive and the bromine being partially negative.\n\n3. The attack of the nucleophile leads to the formation of a new carbon-oxygen bond between the ethoxide ion and the electrophilic carbon. At the same time, the carbon-bromine bond breaks, and the bromide ion leaves as a leaving group.\n\n4. The final product, 1-ethoxy-2-methylcyclohexane, is formed as a result of this nucleophilic substitution reaction.\n\nThe SN2 mechanism is favored in this reaction because the substrate is a secondary alkyl halide, and the nucleophile is strong and not sterically hindered."
