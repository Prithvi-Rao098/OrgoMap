    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant Kc for the reaction, we first need to determine the change in concentration of each species during the reaction. \n\nInitial concentrations:\n[NO2] = 0.20 M\n[N2O4] = 0.10 M\n\nAt equilibrium:\n[NO2] = 0.12 M\n\nSince the balanced equation shows that 2 moles of NO2 are converted to 1 mole of N2O4, we can determine the change in concentration of N2O4 based on the change in concentration of NO2.\n\nChange in [NO2] = 0.20 M - 0.12 M = 0.08 M\n\nSince the stoichiometry is 2:1, the change in [N2O4] will be half of the change in [NO2]:\n\nChange in [N2O4] = 0.08 M / 2 = 0.04 M\n\nNow we can find the equilibrium concentration of N2O4:\n\n[N2O4] at equilibrium = Initial [N2O4] + Change in [N2O4] = 0.10 M + 0.04 M = 0.14 M\n\nNow we can calculate the equilibrium constant Kc using the equilibrium concentrations:\n\nKc = [N2O4] / [NO2]^2\n\nKc = (0.14 M) / (0.12 M)^2\n\nKc = 0.14 / 0.0144\n\nKc ≈ 9.72\n\nThe equilibrium constant Kc for the reaction at 25°C is approximately 9.72."
