    "message_2": "To calculate the efficiency of an electrochemical cell, we need to determine the theoretical maximum work output and compare it to the actual work output.\n\nFirst, let's find the theoretical maximum work output (Wmax). We can use the formula:\n\nWmax = n * F * E\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of electrons transferred (10 moles), F is Faraday's constant (96485 C/mol), and E is the potential difference (1.5 V).\n\nWmax = 10 moles * 96485 C/mol * 1.5 V\nWmax = 1447275 J\n\nNow that we have the theoretical maximum work output, we can calculate the efficiency of the electrochemical cell using the formula:\n\nEfficiency = (Actual work output / Theoretical maximum work output) * 100%\n\nThe actual work output is given as 2500 J.\n\nEfficiency = (2500 J / 1447275 J) * 100%\nEfficiency â‰ˆ 0.1727%\n\nThe efficiency of the electrochemical cell is approximately 0.1727%."
