    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the following formula:\n\nΔH = ΣnΔHf(products) - ΣnΔHf(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH is the enthalpy change for the reaction, n is the stoichiometric coefficient, and ΔHf is the standard enthalpy of formation.\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\n2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(l)\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation for the reactants are:\nΔHf(H2) = 0 kJ/mol\nΔHf(O2) = 0 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation for the product is:\nΔHf(H2O) = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nΔH = [2 × (-285.8)] - [2 × 0 + 1 × 0]\nΔH = (-571.6) - 0\nΔH = -571.6 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change for the reaction is -571.6 kJ."
