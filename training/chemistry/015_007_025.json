    "message_2": "Varying the molecular geometry can significantly impact the calculated electronic excited states and optical properties of a molecule using quantum chemistry methods. Molecular geometry plays a crucial role in determining the distribution of electron density, which in turn affects the electronic structure and optical properties of the molecule. Some of the effects of varying molecular geometry include:\n\n1. Changes in electronic excited states: The energy levels of the molecular orbitals and the corresponding electronic transitions can be affected by changes in molecular geometry. This is because the spatial arrangement of atoms influences the overlap of atomic orbitals, which determines the molecular orbital energies. As a result, the excitation energies and the nature of the excited states can change with varying molecular geometry.\n\n2. Alteration of optical properties: Optical properties, such as absorption and emission spectra, are directly related to the electronic transitions between molecular orbitals. As the molecular geometry changes, the energy levels and the nature of the electronic transitions can change, leading to shifts in the absorption and emission wavelengths. This can result in changes in the color of the molecule or its fluorescence properties.\n\n3. Impact on non-linear optical properties: Non-linear optical properties, such as two-photon absorption and second harmonic generation, are highly sensitive to the molecular geometry. Changes in the geometry can lead to significant variations in these properties, which can be crucial for applications in areas like photonics and optoelectronics.\n\n4. Influence on charge transfer states: Molecular geometry can also affect the charge transfer states, which are crucial for processes like photoinduced electron transfer and energy transfer. Variations in the geometry can alter the spatial distribution of electron density, leading to changes in the charge transfer rates and efficiencies.\n\n5. Changes in conformational dynamics: Varying molecular geometry can lead to changes in the conformational dynamics of the molecule, which can affect the excited state dynamics and relaxation pathways. This can have implications for processes like internal conversion, intersystem crossing, and fluorescence.\n\nIn summary, varying the molecular geometry can have significant effects on the calculated electronic excited states and optical properties of a molecule using quantum chemistry methods. Understanding these effects is essential for designing molecules with desired electronic and optical properties for various applications."
