    "message_2": "The addition of a catalyst does not affect the equilibrium position of the exothermic reaction at constant temperature and pressure. Catalysts work by lowering the activation energy of a reaction, which allows the reaction to proceed at a faster rate. However, catalysts do not change the thermodynamics of the reaction, meaning that the equilibrium constant (K) and the equilibrium position remain the same.\n\nIn the given reaction:\n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g) + heat\n\nA catalyst would increase the rate at which the reaction reaches equilibrium, but it would not change the equilibrium concentrations of N2, H2, and NH3. The role of the catalyst is to provide an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy, allowing the reactants to be converted into products more quickly and vice versa. This results in a faster approach to the equilibrium state, but the final equilibrium position remains unchanged."
