The enthalpy change for the combustion of 1 mole of methane gas is -890.4 kJ/mol.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of 4 moles of methane gas, we can use the given enthalpy change for the combustion of 1 mole of methane gas and multiply it by the number of moles.\n\nEnthalpy change for 1 mole of methane gas = -890.4 kJ/mol\n\nNumber of moles of methane gas = 4 moles\n\nEnthalpy change for 4 moles of methane gas = (-890.4 kJ/mol) Ã— 4 moles = -3561.6 kJ\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy change for the combustion of 4 moles of methane gas at standard conditions is -3561.6 kJ."
