    "message_2": "In the molecule CH3OH (methanol), the carbon atom is bonded to three hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. To determine the hybridization of the carbon atom, we need to consider the number of electron domains around it.\n\nAn electron domain is a region where electrons are most likely to be found. In this case, the carbon atom has four electron domains: three single bonds to hydrogen atoms and one single bond to the oxygen atom.\n\nAccording to the VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) theory, the electron domains will arrange themselves to minimize repulsion. In this case, the four electron domains will form a tetrahedral arrangement.\n\nTo achieve this tetrahedral geometry, the carbon atom's orbitals must hybridize. The carbon atom has the electron configuration 1s²2s²2p². One of the 2s electrons is promoted to the empty 2p orbital, resulting in the electron configuration 1s²2s¹2p³. The 2s and three 2p orbitals then hybridize to form four sp³ hybrid orbitals.\n\nSo, the hybridization of the carbon atom in CH3OH is sp³."
