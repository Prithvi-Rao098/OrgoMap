    "message_2": "To determine the molecular orbital diagram and electronic configuration of a carbon monoxide (CO) molecule using quantum mechanics, we first need to consider the atomic orbitals of carbon (C) and oxygen (O) and their respective electron configurations.\n\nCarbon (C) has an atomic number of 6, and its electron configuration is 1s² 2s² 2p².\nOxygen (O) has an atomic number of 8, and its electron configuration is 1s² 2s² 2p⁴.\n\nFor the molecular orbital diagram, we will focus on the valence orbitals (2s and 2p) of both atoms. The 2s orbitals of C and O can combine to form two molecular orbitals: one bonding (σ2s) and one antibonding (σ2s*). Similarly, the 2p orbitals can combine to form three bonding (σ2p, π2p, π2p) and three antibonding (σ2p*, π2p*, π2p*) molecular orbitals.\n\nThe molecular orbital diagram for CO is as follows:\n\n1. σ2s (bonding)\n2. σ2s* (antibonding)\n3. σ2p (bonding)\n4. π2p (bonding, degenerate with π2p)\n5. π2p (bonding, degenerate with π2p)\n6. σ2p* (antibonding)\n7. π2p* (antibonding, degenerate with π2p*)\n8. π2p* (antibonding, degenerate with π2p*)\n\nNow, we will fill the molecular orbitals with the 10 valence electrons from C and O (4 from C and 6 from O).\n\n1. σ2s: 2 electrons (↑↓)\n2. σ2s*: 0 electrons\n3. σ2p: 2 electrons (↑↓)\n4. π2p: 2 electrons (↑ in one orbital)\n5. π2p: 2 electrons (↑ in the other orbital)\n6. σ2p*: 0 electrons\n7. π2p*: 0 electrons\n8. π2p*: 0 electrons\n\nThe electronic configuration of CO using molecular orbitals is: σ2s² σ2p² π2p⁴.\n\nIt's important to note that CO has a triple bond, consisting of one sigma bond (σ) and two pi bonds (π). The bond order can be calculated as (number of electrons in bonding orbitals - number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2 = (8 - 0) / 2 = 4. This indicates a strong bond between the carbon and oxygen atoms in the CO molecule."
