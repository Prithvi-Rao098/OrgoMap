    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic moment of Co(NH₃)₆³⁺ complex ion, we need to find out the number of unpaired electrons in the cobalt ion.\n\nThe Co(NH₃)₆³⁺ complex ion has a central cobalt ion (Co³⁺) surrounded by six ammonia (NH₃) ligands. The oxidation state of cobalt in this complex is +3.\n\nThe electronic configuration of cobalt (Co) is [Ar] 3d⁷ 4s². When cobalt loses three electrons to form Co³⁺, its electronic configuration becomes [Ar] 3d⁶.\n\nNow, we need to determine the nature of the complex, whether it is high-spin or low-spin. Since ammonia (NH₃) is a strong field ligand, it causes the pairing of electrons in the d orbitals. Therefore, the complex is a low-spin complex.\n\nThe d-orbital splitting in an octahedral complex (like Co(NH₃)₆³⁺) is such that three orbitals (t₂g) are lower in energy than the other two orbitals (e_g). In a low-spin complex, the electrons will fill the lower energy orbitals (t₂g) before occupying the higher energy orbitals (e_g).\n\nSo, the electronic configuration of Co³⁺ in the Co(NH₃)₆³⁺ complex will be:\n\nt₂g ↑↓ ↑↓ ↑↓\ne_g ↑↑\n\nAs we can see, there are no unpaired electrons in the Co³⁺ ion in this complex. Therefore, the magnetic moment of the Co(NH₃)₆³⁺ complex ion is 0. This complex is diamagnetic."
