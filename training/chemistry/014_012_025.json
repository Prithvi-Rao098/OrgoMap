    "message_2": "Metallofullerenes and metalloclusters are complex structures that consist of metal atoms encapsulated within or coordinated to carbon-based fullerene cages or clusters. They have attracted significant interest due to their unique properties and potential applications in materials science and biomedicine. \n\nSynthesis methods of metallofullerenes and metalloclusters:\n\n1. Arc-discharge method: This is the most common method for synthesizing metallofullerenes. It involves the evaporation of a graphite rod containing metal atoms (such as lanthanides or transition metals) under an inert atmosphere. The metal atoms become trapped within the forming fullerene cages, resulting in the formation of metallofullerenes.\n\n2. Laser vaporization: In this method, a metal-containing graphite target is vaporized using a high-power laser, leading to the formation of metallofullerenes in the resulting plasma.\n\n3. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD): Metallofullerenes can also be synthesized by introducing metal-containing precursors into a CVD reactor, where they decompose and react with carbon species to form metallofullerenes.\n\n4. Template-assisted synthesis: Metalloclusters can be synthesized using templates, such as porous materials or self-assembled structures, which direct the growth and organization of metal atoms into specific cluster geometries.\n\nStructural properties of metallofullerenes and metalloclusters:\n\n1. Metallofullerenes typically consist of a metal atom or a cluster of metal atoms encapsulated within a fullerene cage, such as C60, C70, or larger fullerenes. The metal atoms can be single atoms, dimers, or larger clusters, and they can be of the same or different elements.\n\n2. Metalloclusters are formed by the coordination of metal atoms to each other or to ligands, such as organic molecules or other metal atoms. They can have various shapes and sizes, ranging from simple tetrahedra to more complex polyhedra.\n\nThe unique structural properties of metallofullerenes and metalloclusters lead to several potential applications in materials science and biomedicine:\n\n1. Electronics and optoelectronics: Due to their electronic properties, metallofullerenes can be used as components in organic solar cells, field-effect transistors, and light-emitting diodes.\n\n2. Catalysis: Metalloclusters can act as catalysts for various chemical reactions, such as hydrogenation, oxidation, and carbon-carbon bond formation, due to their unique electronic and geometric properties.\n\n3. Biomedical applications: Metallofullerenes have been explored as drug delivery vehicles, MRI contrast agents, and radiosensitizers for cancer therapy. Their ability to encapsulate metal atoms allows for the incorporation of therapeutic or diagnostic agents, while the fullerene cage can protect the payload from degradation and control its release.\n\n4. Magnetic materials: Metalloclusters with specific magnetic properties can be used to create new magnetic materials for data storage and other applications.\n\nIn summary, the synthesis methods and structural properties of metallofullerenes and metalloclusters play a crucial role in determining their potential applications in materials science and biomedicine. Their unique electronic, magnetic, and catalytic properties make them promising candidates for a wide range of applications, from electronics to drug delivery."
