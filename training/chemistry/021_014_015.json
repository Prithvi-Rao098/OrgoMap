    "message_2": "The VSEPR geometry of the molecule CH4 (methane) is tetrahedral. In this molecule, the central carbon atom is bonded to four hydrogen atoms. According to the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory, the electron pairs around the central atom will arrange themselves to minimize repulsion, resulting in a tetrahedral geometry with bond angles of approximately 109.5 degrees."
