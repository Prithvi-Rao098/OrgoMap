    "message_2": "In solid sodium chloride (NaCl), the type of bonding that exists is ionic bonding. This occurs between the positively charged sodium ions (Na+) and the negatively charged chloride ions (Cl-). The electrostatic attraction between these oppositely charged ions forms a three-dimensional lattice structure, resulting in a stable crystalline solid."
