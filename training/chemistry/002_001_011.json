    "message_2": "To balance the chemical equation, we need to make sure that the number of atoms for each element is the same on both sides of the equation. Here's the balanced equation:\n\nMgSO4 + 2 NaOH -> Mg(OH)2 + Na2SO4\n\nThe coefficients for each compound are:\n- MgSO4: 1\n- NaOH: 2\n- Mg(OH)2: 1\n- Na2SO4: 1"
