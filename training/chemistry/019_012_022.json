    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change (∆H°) for the dissolution of NaCl in water, we need to know the standard enthalpy of solution for NaCl. The standard enthalpy of solution is the amount of heat absorbed or released when one mole of solute dissolves in a solvent to form a solution under standard conditions (298 K and 1 atm pressure). \n\nThe standard enthalpy of solution for NaCl is -3.88 kJ/mol.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of NaCl in 5 grams:\n\nmoles = mass / molar mass\nmoles = 5 g / 58.44 g/mol\nmoles = 0.0856 mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the dissolution of 5 grams of NaCl:\n\n∆H = moles × standard enthalpy of solution\n∆H = 0.0856 mol × (-3.88 kJ/mol)\n∆H = -0.332 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the dissolution of 5 grams of NaCl in water at 298 K is -0.332 kJ."
