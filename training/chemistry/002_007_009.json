    "message_2": "When sodium chloride (NaCl) reacts with silver nitrate (AgNO3), a double displacement reaction occurs, also known as a metathesis reaction. The expected products of this reaction are silver chloride (AgCl) and sodium nitrate (NaNO3). The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nNaCl (aq) + AgNO3 (aq) â†’ AgCl (s) + NaNO3 (aq)\n\nIn this reaction, the sodium (Na) and silver (Ag) ions switch places, forming new compounds. Silver chloride (AgCl) is an insoluble solid that precipitates out of the solution, while sodium nitrate (NaNO3) remains dissolved in the solution."
