    "message_2": "To optimize the process for the production of adhesives while reducing the use of harmful chemicals and increasing the efficiency of the reaction, the following steps can be taken:\n\n1. Selection of raw materials: Choose raw materials that are less harmful and more environmentally friendly. For example, using bio-based materials such as starch, cellulose, or lignin can help reduce the use of harmful chemicals.\n\n2. Green chemistry principles: Implement green chemistry principles in the production process. These principles focus on reducing waste, using renewable feedstocks, designing safer chemicals, and increasing energy efficiency.\n\n3. Use of catalysts: Employing catalysts in the reaction can help increase the efficiency of the process. Catalysts can speed up the reaction, reduce the amount of energy required, and lower the production of unwanted by-products.\n\n4. Process optimization: Optimize the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and pH, to achieve the highest yield and selectivity. This can be done through experimentation or using computational methods to model and predict the best conditions.\n\n5. Recycling and waste reduction: Implement recycling and waste reduction strategies in the production process. This can include reusing solvents, recovering unreacted raw materials, and finding ways to utilize by-products.\n\n6. Alternative production methods: Explore alternative production methods that are more environmentally friendly and efficient. For example, using enzymatic processes or microwave-assisted synthesis can help reduce the use of harmful chemicals and increase the efficiency of the reaction.\n\n7. Continuous processing: Transition from batch processing to continuous processing, which can help improve efficiency, reduce waste, and minimize the use of harmful chemicals.\n\n8. Monitoring and control: Implement real-time monitoring and control systems to ensure that the production process is operating at optimal conditions. This can help detect any deviations from the desired conditions and make adjustments accordingly.\n\n9. Employee training: Provide training to employees on the importance of sustainability and the proper handling of chemicals to minimize the risk of accidents and exposure to harmful substances.\n\n10. Collaboration with stakeholders: Collaborate with suppliers, customers, and regulatory agencies to ensure that the production process meets environmental and safety standards. This can help identify areas for improvement and drive innovation in the development of safer and more efficient adhesives."
