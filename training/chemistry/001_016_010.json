    "message_2": "The reaction between benzene and HNO3 in the presence of H2SO4 to form nitrobenzene is an example of electrophilic aromatic substitution. The mechanism for this reaction can be described in the following steps:\n\n1. Generation of the electrophile: Nitric acid (HNO3) reacts with sulfuric acid (H2SO4) to form the nitronium ion (NO2+), which is a strong electrophile.\n   HNO3 + H2SO4 → NO2+ + HSO4- + H2O\n\n2. Electrophilic attack: The electrophile, NO2+, attacks the benzene ring, which is rich in electron density due to the delocalized π electrons. This results in the formation of a resonance-stabilized carbocation called the sigma complex or arenium ion.\n\n3. Deprotonation: A base, usually the bisulfate ion (HSO4-) formed in the first step, abstracts a proton from the sigma complex, restoring the aromaticity of the benzene ring and forming nitrobenzene as the final product.\n\nOverall, the reaction can be summarized as:\nBenzene + HNO3 (in the presence of H2SO4) → Nitrobenzene + H2O"
