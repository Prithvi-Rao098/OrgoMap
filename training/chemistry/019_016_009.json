    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the vaporization of 50g of water, we first need to determine the number of moles of water being vaporized. The molecular weight of water (H2O) is 18.015 g/mol.\n\nNumber of moles = mass / molecular weight\nNumber of moles = 50g / 18.015 g/mol = 2.775 moles\n\nNow, we can use the standard enthalpy of vaporization of water (40.79 kJ/mol) to calculate the total enthalpy change.\n\nStandard enthalpy change = number of moles × standard enthalpy of vaporization\nStandard enthalpy change = 2.775 moles × 40.79 kJ/mol = 113.19 kJ\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the vaporization of 50g of water at its boiling point and 1 atm is 113.19 kJ."
