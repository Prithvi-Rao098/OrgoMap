    "message_1": "What is the concentration of an HCl solution if 25.0 ml of the solution requires 35.0 ml of 0.10 M NaOH solution to reach the endpoint of titration?",
    "message_2": "To find the concentration of the HCl solution, we can use the concept of titration and the equation:\n\nM1V1 = M2V2\n\nwhere M1 and V1 are the molarity and volume of the HCl solution, and M2 and V2 are the molarity and volume of the NaOH solution.\n\nWe are given:\nV1 = 25.0 mL (volume of HCl solution)\nM2 = 0.10 M (molarity of NaOH solution)\nV2 = 35.0 mL (volume of NaOH solution)\n\nWe need to find M1 (the concentration of the HCl solution). Rearranging the equation to solve for M1, we get:\n\nM1 = (M2 * V2) / V1\n\nNow, plug in the given values:\n\nM1 = (0.10 M * 35.0 mL) / 25.0 mL\n\nM1 = 3.50 M / 25.0\n\nM1 = 0.14 M\n\nSo, the concentration of the HCl solution is 0.14 M."
