    "message_2": "A bond formed between a chlorine atom and a sodium atom would be an ionic bond. The nature of this bond is that it involves the transfer of one or more electrons from one atom to another, resulting in the formation of oppositely charged ions. In this case, the sodium atom loses an electron to become a positively charged ion (Na+), while the chlorine atom gains an electron to become a negatively charged ion (Cl-). These ions are then attracted to each other due to their opposite charges, forming a stable ionic bond."
