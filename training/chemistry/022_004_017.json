    "message_2": "The balanced chemical equation for the reaction between aluminium and copper (II) sulfate is:\n\n2 Al (s) + 3 CuSO₄ (aq) → Al₂(SO₄)₃ (aq) + 3 Cu (s)\n\nTo identify the type of redox reaction, we need to determine the oxidation states of each element before and after the reaction.\n\nIn the reactants:\n- Aluminium (Al) is in its elemental form, so its oxidation state is 0.\n- Copper (Cu) in copper (II) sulfate has an oxidation state of +2.\n- Sulfur (S) in sulfate ion (SO₄²⁻) has an oxidation state of +6.\n- Oxygen (O) in sulfate ion (SO₄²⁻) has an oxidation state of -2.\n\nIn the products:\n- Aluminium (Al) in aluminium sulfate (Al₂(SO₄)₃) has an oxidation state of +3.\n- Copper (Cu) is in its elemental form, so its oxidation state is 0.\n- Sulfur (S) in sulfate ion (SO₄²⁻) has an oxidation state of +6 (no change).\n- Oxygen (O) in sulfate ion (SO₄²⁻) has an oxidation state of -2 (no change).\n\nComparing the oxidation states before and after the reaction, we can see that:\n- Aluminium (Al) is oxidized from 0 to +3 (loses 3 electrons).\n- Copper (Cu) is reduced from +2 to 0 (gains 2 electrons).\n\nSince one species is oxidized while another is reduced, this reaction is a redox reaction, specifically a single displacement (also known as a single replacement) reaction. In this case, aluminium displaces copper in the copper (II) sulfate compound."
