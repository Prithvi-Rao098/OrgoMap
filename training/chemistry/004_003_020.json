    "message_1": "Identify the unknown compound \"X\" using mass spectrometry data given below. The molecular ion peak of \"X\" is observed at m/z 120 with a relative intensity of 100%. Additionally, the following fragment peaks with their respective relative intensities were also observed: m/z 105 (40%), m/z 92 (15%), m/z 77 (10%), and m/z 65 (5%). What is the molecular formula of \"X\" and what is its structural formula?",
    "message_2": "To identify the unknown compound \"X\" using mass spectrometry data, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the molecular formula of \"X\" based on the molecular ion peak.\n2. Analyze the fragment peaks to deduce the possible structure of \"X\".\n\nStep 1: Determine the molecular formula of \"X\"\nThe molecular ion peak is observed at m/z 120, which indicates the molecular weight of \"X\" is 120. The most common elements in organic compounds are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. We can use the nitrogen rule and the degrees of unsaturation to help narrow down the possibilities.\n\nThe nitrogen rule states that if a compound has an odd mass, it must have an odd number of nitrogen atoms. Since the molecular weight of \"X\" is 120 (an even number), it must have an even number of nitrogen atoms (0 or 2).\n\nThe degrees of unsaturation can be calculated using the formula: U = C - (H/2) + (N/2) + 1, where U is the degrees of unsaturation, C is the number of carbon atoms, H is the number of hydrogen atoms, and N is the number of nitrogen atoms. The degrees of unsaturation can indicate the presence of double bonds, triple bonds, or rings in the molecule.\n\nConsidering the molecular weight of 120 and the possible presence of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, a reasonable molecular formula for \"X\" could be C8H8O (120.15 g/mol).\n\nStep 2: Analyze the fragment peaks\nNow, let's analyze the fragment peaks and their relative intensities:\n\nm/z 105 (40%): Loss of a methyl group (CH3, 15 g/mol) from the molecular ion peak suggests the presence of a methyl group in the molecule.\n\nm/z 92 (15%): Loss of CO (28 g/mol) from the molecular ion peak suggests the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in the molecule.\n\nm/z 77 (10%): Loss of a propyl group (C3H7, 43 g/mol) from the molecular ion peak suggests the presence of a propyl group in the molecule.\n\nm/z 65 (5%): Loss of a phenyl group (C6H5, 77 g/mol) from the molecular ion peak suggests the presence of a phenyl group in the molecule.\n\nBased on the fragment peaks and the molecular formula C8H8O, the structural formula of \"X\" can be deduced as 1-phenyl-1-propanone (also known as propiophenone):\n\nC6H5-C(O)-CH2-CH3\n\nIn conclusion, the molecular formula of \"X\" is C8H8O, and its structural formula is 1-phenyl-1-propanone."
