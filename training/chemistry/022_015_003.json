    "message_1": "What is the percent yield of a reaction if 5.5 grams of product were obtained from the reaction of 7.8 grams of reactant and the theoretical yield of the product is 9.2 grams?",
    "message_2": "The percent yield of a reaction can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nPercent Yield = (Actual Yield / Theoretical Yield) x 100\n\nIn this case, the actual yield is 5.5 grams, and the theoretical yield is 9.2 grams. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nPercent Yield = (5.5 / 9.2) x 100\n\nPercent Yield = 0.5978 x 100\n\nPercent Yield â‰ˆ 59.78%\n\nSo, the percent yield of the reaction is approximately 59.78%."
