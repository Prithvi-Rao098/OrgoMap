    "message_1": "What is the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between aniline and chlorine gas to form 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline? What is the theoretical yield of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline if 10 g of aniline and excess chlorine gas is used in the reaction?",
    "message_2": "The reaction between aniline and chlorine gas to form 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline involves two steps. First, aniline reacts with nitric acid to form 4-nitroaniline. Then, 4-nitroaniline reacts with chlorine gas to form 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline.\n\nStep 1: Aniline + HNO3 → 4-Nitroaniline + H2O\nC6H7N + HNO3 → C6H6N2O2 + H2O\n\nStep 2: 4-Nitroaniline + Cl2 → 2-Chloro-4-nitroaniline\nC6H6N2O2 + Cl2 → C6H4ClN2O2\n\nNow, let's calculate the theoretical yield of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline.\n\n1. Calculate the molar mass of aniline (C6H7N):\n(6 × 12.01) + (7 × 1.01) + 14.01 = 93.13 g/mol\n\n2. Calculate the moles of aniline:\n10 g / 93.13 g/mol = 0.107 moles\n\n3. Calculate the molar mass of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline (C6H4ClN2O2):\n(6 × 12.01) + (4 × 1.01) + 35.45 + (2 × 14.01) + (2 × 16.00) = 157.57 g/mol\n\n4. Since the reaction has a 1:1 stoichiometry, the moles of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline produced will be the same as the moles of aniline used:\n0.107 moles\n\n5. Calculate the theoretical yield of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline:\n0.107 moles × 157.57 g/mol = 16.86 g\n\nThe theoretical yield of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline is 16.86 g."
