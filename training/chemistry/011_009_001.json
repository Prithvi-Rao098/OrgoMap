    "message_2": "To calculate the wavelength of the photon emitted when an electron in a hydrogen atom relaxes from the second excited state to the ground state, we can use the Rydberg formula for hydrogen:\n\n1/λ = R_H * (1/n1² - 1/n2²)\n\nwhere λ is the wavelength of the emitted photon, R_H is the Rydberg constant for hydrogen (approximately 1.097 x 10^7 m⁻¹), n1 is the principal quantum number of the lower energy level (ground state), and n2 is the principal quantum number of the higher energy level (second excited state).\n\nFor hydrogen, the ground state corresponds to n1 = 1, and the second excited state corresponds to n2 = 3.\n\n1/λ = R_H * (1/1² - 1/3²)\n1/λ = 1.097 x 10^7 m⁻¹ * (1 - 1/9)\n1/λ = 1.097 x 10^7 m⁻¹ * (8/9)\n\nNow, we can calculate the wavelength:\n\nλ = 1 / (1.097 x 10^7 m⁻¹ * 8/9)\nλ ≈ 1.215 x 10⁻⁷ m\n\nSo, the wavelength of the photon emitted when an electron in a hydrogen atom relaxes from the second excited state to the ground state is approximately 1.215 x 10⁻⁷ m or 121.5 nm. This photon is in the ultraviolet range of the electromagnetic spectrum."
