    "message_2": "To calculate the bond order and bond length of the nitrate ion (NO3-) in its resonance hybrid form, we first need to understand the resonance structures and the concept of bond order.\n\nThe nitrate ion (NO3-) has three resonance structures, in which the nitrogen atom is double bonded to one of the oxygen atoms and single bonded to the other two oxygen atoms. The three structures are equivalent, and the actual structure of the nitrate ion is a resonance hybrid of these three structures.\n\nBond order is defined as the number of bonding electron pairs shared between two atoms in a molecule. In the case of the nitrate ion, the bond order can be calculated by averaging the bond orders of the three resonance structures.\n\nIn each resonance structure, there is one double bond (bond order = 2) and two single bonds (bond order = 1). So, the total bond order for all three structures is:\n\nTotal bond order = (1 double bond × 2) + (2 single bonds × 1) = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nSince there are three equivalent resonance structures, we need to divide the total bond order by 3 to get the average bond order for the resonance hybrid:\n\nAverage bond order = Total bond order / Number of resonance structures = 4 / 3 ≈ 1.33\n\nNow, let's calculate the bond length. The bond length of a molecule is inversely proportional to the bond order. As the bond order increases, the bond length decreases. We can use the known bond lengths of N=O (double bond) and N-O (single bond) to estimate the bond length in the nitrate ion.\n\nThe typical bond length for a nitrogen-oxygen double bond (N=O) is around 1.21 Å, and for a nitrogen-oxygen single bond (N-O) is around 1.41 Å. Since the nitrate ion has an average bond order of 1.33, its bond length will be between these two values.\n\nTo estimate the bond length, we can use a weighted average based on the bond order:\n\nBond length (NO3-) ≈ (1.33 - 1) / (2 - 1) × (1.21 - 1.41) + 1.41 = 0.33 × (-0.20) + 1.41 ≈ -0.066 + 1.41 ≈ 1.344 Å\n\nSo, the bond length of the nitrate ion (NO3-) in its resonance hybrid form is approximately 1.344 Å, and the bond order is 1.33."
