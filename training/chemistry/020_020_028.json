Calculate the change in equilibrium constant when the temperature is increased from 25°C to 50°C, given that the standard enthalpy of reaction is -50 kJ/mol and the activation energy is 75 kJ/mol.",
    "message_2": "Increasing the temperature generally affects the formation of complex ions by shifting the equilibrium position. In the case of Fe(SCN)2+, since the standard enthalpy of reaction is negative (-50 kJ/mol), the reaction is exothermic. According to Le Chatelier's principle, increasing the temperature will shift the equilibrium to the side that absorbs heat, which is the side with the reactants. Therefore, increasing the temperature will decrease the formation of Fe(SCN)2+.\n\nTo calculate the change in the equilibrium constant (K) when the temperature is increased from 25°C to 50°C, we can use the Van't Hoff equation:\n\nln(K2/K1) = -ΔH°/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere K1 and K2 are the equilibrium constants at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively, ΔH° is the standard enthalpy of reaction, and R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K).\n\nFirst, convert the temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin:\nT1 = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\nT2 = 50°C + 273.15 = 323.15 K\n\nNext, convert the standard enthalpy of reaction from kJ/mol to J/mol:\nΔH° = -50 kJ/mol * 1000 J/kJ = -50000 J/mol\n\nNow, plug the values into the Van't Hoff equation:\nln(K2/K1) = -(-50000 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K) * (1/323.15 K - 1/298.15 K)\n\nln(K2/K1) ≈ 10.15\n\nTo find the change in the equilibrium constant, we can take the exponential of both sides:\nK2/K1 = e^(10.15) ≈ 25600\n\nSince we don't have the initial equilibrium constant (K1), we can't find the exact values of K1 and K2. However, we can conclude that the equilibrium constant at 50°C (K2) is approximately 25600 times smaller than the equilibrium constant at 25°C (K1). This means that the formation of Fe(SCN)2+ is significantly less favorable at the higher temperature."
