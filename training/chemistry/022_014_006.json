    "message_2": "To determine the limiting reactant and the amount of carbon dioxide produced, we need to first write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nCH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O\n\nNow, we need to find the moles of each reactant:\n\nMoles of CH4 = mass / molar mass = 5.0 g / (12.01 g/mol (C) + 4.0 g/mol (H)) = 5.0 g / 16.01 g/mol ≈ 0.312 moles\n\nMoles of O2 = mass / molar mass = 10.0 g / (2 * 16.00 g/mol) = 10.0 g / 32.00 g/mol ≈ 0.3125 moles\n\nNow, we need to determine the limiting reactant by comparing the mole ratios:\n\nMole ratio of CH4 to O2 in the balanced equation is 1:2. \n\n0.312 moles CH4 * (2 moles O2 / 1 mole CH4) = 0.624 moles O2 required\n\nSince we have only 0.3125 moles of O2, O2 is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow, we can determine the amount of CO2 produced using the stoichiometry of the balanced equation:\n\n0.3125 moles O2 * (1 mole CO2 / 2 moles O2) ≈ 0.15625 moles CO2\n\nFinally, we convert the moles of CO2 to grams:\n\nMass of CO2 = moles * molar mass = 0.15625 moles * (12.01 g/mol (C) + 2 * 16.00 g/mol (O)) ≈ 0.15625 moles * 44.01 g/mol ≈ 6.88 g\n\nSo, the limiting reactant is oxygen (O2), and 6.88 grams of carbon dioxide (CO2) can be produced."
