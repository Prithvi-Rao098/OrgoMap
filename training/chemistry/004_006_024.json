    "message_1": "What is the purity of a sample of acetanilide that has a melting point range of 112-114°C when the literature melting point range for pure acetanilide is 114-115°C?",
    "message_2": "Determining the exact purity of a sample based on its melting point range is not possible. However, we can infer that the sample is impure because its melting point range is lower than the literature value for pure acetanilide (114-115°C). Impurities in a sample typically cause the melting point to decrease and the range to widen.\n\nTo obtain a more accurate estimation of the purity, other analytical techniques such as chromatography, spectroscopy, or elemental analysis would be necessary."
