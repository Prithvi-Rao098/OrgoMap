    "message_2": "To purify chemical X from impurities A, B, and C using the least possible amount of solvent and equipment, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose a suitable solvent: Select a solvent in which chemical X has good solubility, while impurities A, B, and C have poor solubility. This will help in the separation process.\n\n2. Recrystallization: Dissolve chemical X in the chosen solvent at a high temperature, close to the solvent's boiling point. At this temperature, impurities A, B, and C should remain insoluble or have very low solubility. Filter the hot solution to remove the insoluble impurities.\n\n3. Cooling: Allow the hot solution to cool down slowly to room temperature. As the temperature decreases, chemical X will start to crystallize out of the solution, while impurities A, B, and C remain dissolved.\n\n4. Filtration: Once the solution has reached room temperature, filter it to separate the purified chemical X crystals from the remaining liquid containing impurities A, B, and C.\n\n5. Washing and drying: Wash the purified chemical X crystals with a small amount of cold solvent to remove any traces of impurities A, B, and C. Then, let the crystals air-dry or use a vacuum desiccator to remove the remaining solvent.\n\nBy using this recrystallization method, you can purify chemical X from impurities A, B, and C with minimal use of solvent and equipment. The key to success is choosing an appropriate solvent and optimizing the recrystallization conditions to maximize the separation of chemical X from the impurities."
