    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the formula:\n\nΔH_reaction = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH_f is the enthalpy of formation.\n\nFor the products:\n2 moles of H2O(g): 2 × (-241.8 kJ/mol) = -483.6 kJ\n2 moles of SO2(g): 2 × (-296.8 kJ/mol) = -593.6 kJ\n\nFor the reactants:\n2 moles of H2S(g): 2 × (-20.2 kJ/mol) = -40.4 kJ\n3 moles of O2(g): 3 × 0 kJ/mol (since O2 is in its standard state) = 0 kJ\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nΔH_reaction = (-483.6 kJ + (-593.6 kJ)) - (-40.4 kJ + 0 kJ)\nΔH_reaction = -1077.2 kJ + 40.4 kJ\nΔH_reaction = -1036.8 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change for the reaction is -1036.8 kJ."
