    "message_1": "Calculate the bond dissociation energy of a molecule of hydrogen (H₂) given that the bond length is 74 pm and the energy required to break the bond is 436 kJ/mol.",
    "message_2": "The bond dissociation energy is the energy required to break a bond between two atoms in a molecule. In this case, we are given the energy required to break the bond in a hydrogen molecule (H₂) as 436 kJ/mol. Therefore, the bond dissociation energy of a hydrogen molecule (H₂) is 436 kJ/mol. The bond length information is not necessary for this calculation, as the bond dissociation energy is already provided."
