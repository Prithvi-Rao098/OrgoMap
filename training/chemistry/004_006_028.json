    "message_2": "To determine the purity of a sample of aspirin obtained from a local pharmacy, you will need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Obtain the sample of aspirin from the pharmacy.\n2. Determine the melting point of the aspirin sample using a melting point apparatus.\n3. Compare the experimental melting point with the literature value of the melting point of pure aspirin.\n\nHere's a more detailed explanation of each step:\n\n1. Obtain the sample of aspirin:\nPurchase a bottle of aspirin from a local pharmacy. Make sure it is pure aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) and not a mixture with other active ingredients.\n\n2. Determine the melting point of the aspirin sample:\na. Crush a small amount of the aspirin sample into a fine powder.\nb. Place the powdered aspirin into a capillary tube, making sure to pack it tightly.\nc. Insert the capillary tube into a melting point apparatus.\nd. Slowly heat the sample and observe the temperature at which the aspirin begins to melt and the temperature at which it completely melts. Record these temperatures as the melting point range.\n\n3. Compare the experimental melting point with the literature value:\nThe literature value for the melting point of pure aspirin is approximately 135-136°C. Compare your experimental melting point range to this value.\n\nIf the experimental melting point range is close to the literature value (within 1-2°C), the aspirin sample is likely to be relatively pure. If the experimental melting point range is significantly lower than the literature value, it may indicate the presence of impurities in the sample.\n\nKeep in mind that this method provides an estimate of the purity of the aspirin sample, and other analytical techniques (such as chromatography or spectroscopy) may be needed for a more accurate determination of purity."
