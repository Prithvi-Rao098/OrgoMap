The initial concentration of NH3 is 0.6 M and there are no other reactants or products present.",
    "message_2": "The balanced chemical equation for the decomposition of ammonia (NH3) is:\n\n2 NH3(g) ⇌ 3 H2(g) + N2(g)\n\nLet's denote the initial concentration of NH3 as [NH3]0 = 0.6 M, and the initial concentrations of H2 and N2 as [H2]0 = [N2]0 = 0 M, since they are not present initially.\n\nAt equilibrium, let the change in concentration of NH3 be -2x, then the change in concentration of H2 will be +3x, and the change in concentration of N2 will be +x.\n\nSo, the equilibrium concentrations will be:\n[NH3] = 0.6 - 2x\n[H2] = 3x\n[N2] = x\n\nThe equilibrium constant (Kc) is given as 0.015. We can write the expression for Kc as:\n\nKc = ([H2]^3 * [N2]) / ([NH3]^2)\n\nSubstitute the equilibrium concentrations into the Kc expression:\n\n0.015 = ((3x)^3 * x) / ((0.6 - 2x)^2)\n\nNow, we need to solve for x:\n\n0.015 = (27x^4) / (0.36 - 2.4x + 4x^2)\n\n0.015(0.36 - 2.4x + 4x^2) = 27x^4\n\n0.0054 - 0.036x + 0.06x^2 = 27x^4\n\nRearrange the equation:\n\n27x^4 - 0.06x^2 + 0.036x - 0.0054 = 0\n\nThis is a quartic equation, which is difficult to solve analytically. However, we can use numerical methods to find the value of x. Using a numerical solver, we find that x ≈ 0.0124.\n\nNow, we can find the equilibrium concentrations:\n\n[NH3] = 0.6 - 2x ≈ 0.6 - 2(0.0124) ≈ 0.5752 M\n[H2] = 3x ≈ 3(0.0124) ≈ 0.0372 M\n[N2] = x ≈ 0.0124 M\n\nSo, the equilibrium concentrations are approximately:\n[NH3] ≈ 0.5752 M\n[H2] ≈ 0.0372 M\n[N2] ≈ 0.0124 M"
