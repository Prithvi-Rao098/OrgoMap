    "message_2": "The bond strength of a CO double bond is generally weaker than that of an NN triple bond. To understand the reasoning behind this, we need to consider two factors: bond length and bond dissociation energy.\n\n1. Bond Length: Bond length is the distance between the nuclei of two bonded atoms. In general, shorter bond lengths correspond to stronger bonds. A triple bond is shorter than a double bond because it has more shared electron pairs, which leads to a stronger electrostatic attraction between the two bonded atoms. In the case of CO and NN, the NN triple bond is shorter than the CO double bond, which contributes to its higher bond strength.\n\n2. Bond Dissociation Energy: Bond dissociation energy is the energy required to break a bond between two atoms. A higher bond dissociation energy indicates a stronger bond. The bond dissociation energy for an NN triple bond is approximately 941 kJ/mol, while that for a CO double bond is around 745 kJ/mol. This difference in bond dissociation energy further supports the idea that the NN triple bond is stronger than the CO double bond.\n\nIn summary, the NN triple bond is stronger than the CO double bond due to its shorter bond length and higher bond dissociation energy."
