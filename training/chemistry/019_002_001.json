    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy of formation of propane (C3H8), we can use the following combustion reaction:\n\nC3H8(g) + 5O2(g) → 3CO2(g) + 4H2O(l)\n\nThe standard enthalpy of combustion of propane is given as -2220.1 kJ/mol. We can use Hess's Law to relate the enthalpy of formation of propane to the enthalpy of formation of CO2 and H2O.\n\nΔH_combustion = [3ΔH_f(CO2) + 4ΔH_f(H2O)] - ΔH_f(C3H8)\n\nWe are given the standard enthalpy of formation of CO2 and H2O:\n\nΔH_f(CO2) = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔH_f(H2O) = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nNow we can plug these values into the equation:\n\n-2220.1 kJ/mol = [3(-393.5 kJ/mol) + 4(-285.8 kJ/mol)] - ΔH_f(C3H8)\n\n-2220.1 kJ/mol = [-1180.5 kJ/mol - 1143.2 kJ/mol] - ΔH_f(C3H8)\n\n-2220.1 kJ/mol = -2323.7 kJ/mol + ΔH_f(C3H8)\n\nNow, we can solve for the standard enthalpy of formation of propane:\n\nΔH_f(C3H8) = -2323.7 kJ/mol + 2220.1 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_f(C3H8) = 103.6 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy of formation of propane (C3H8) is 103.6 kJ/mol."
