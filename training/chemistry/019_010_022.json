    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of methane, we need to use the standard enthalpies of formation for the reactants and products involved in the reaction. The balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane is:\n\nCH₄(g) + 2 O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2 H₂O(l)\n\nThe standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) for the substances involved are:\n\nΔHf° [CH₄(g)] = -74.8 kJ/mol\nΔHf° [O₂(g)] = 0 kJ/mol (since O₂ is in its standard state)\nΔHf° [CO₂(g)] = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔHf° [H₂O(l)] = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can use Hess's Law to calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction (ΔHrxn°):\n\nΔHrxn° = [ΔHf°(products) - ΔHf°(reactants)]\n\nΔHrxn° = [1 mol × (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 mol × (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [1 mol × (-74.8 kJ/mol) + 2 mol × 0 kJ/mol]\n\nΔHrxn° = (-393.5 kJ + 2 × -285.8 kJ) - (-74.8 kJ)\n\nΔHrxn° = (-393.5 kJ - 571.6 kJ) + 74.8 kJ\n\nΔHrxn° = -890.3 kJ + 74.8 kJ\n\nΔHrxn° = -815.5 kJ\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of methane to produce carbon dioxide and water at standard conditions (298 K and 1 atm) is -815.5 kJ/mol."
