    "message_2": "First, we need to calculate the number of moles of ice. The molar mass of water (H2O) is approximately 18.015 g/mol.\n\nNumber of moles of ice = (mass of ice) / (molar mass of water)\nNumber of moles of ice = 20 g / 18.015 g/mol = 1.11 mol (rounded to 2 decimal places)\n\nNext, we will calculate the heat energy required to melt the ice using the enthalpy of fusion.\n\nHeat energy required to melt ice = (number of moles of ice) × (enthalpy of fusion)\nHeat energy required to melt ice = 1.11 mol × 6.01 kJ/mol = 6.67 kJ\n\nNow, we will convert the heat energy from kJ to J.\n\nHeat energy required to melt ice = 6.67 kJ × 1000 J/kJ = 6670 J\n\nSince the ice is at 0°C and it is melting, the final temperature of the resulting water will also be 0°C. The heat energy required to melt the ice is used to break the bonds between the water molecules in the ice lattice, not to increase the temperature of the water. Once the ice is completely melted, any additional heat energy would then increase the temperature of the water."
