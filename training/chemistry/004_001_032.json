    "message_2": "To find the concentration of the hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution, we can use the concept of stoichiometry and the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between HCl and sodium hydroxide (NaOH):\n\nHCl + NaOH → NaCl + H₂O\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that one mole of HCl reacts with one mole of NaOH. We can use the volume and concentration of NaOH to find the moles of NaOH, and then use the stoichiometry to find the moles of HCl. Finally, we can use the volume of HCl to find its concentration.\n\n1. Calculate the moles of NaOH:\nmoles of NaOH = volume (L) × concentration (M)\nmoles of NaOH = 0.018 L × 0.1 M\nmoles of NaOH = 0.0018 moles\n\n2. Use stoichiometry to find moles of HCl:\nmoles of HCl = moles of NaOH (since the mole ratio is 1:1)\nmoles of HCl = 0.0018 moles\n\n3. Calculate the concentration of HCl:\nconcentration (M) = moles of HCl / volume (L)\nconcentration (M) = 0.0018 moles / 0.025 L\nconcentration (M) = 0.072 M\n\nSo, the concentration of the hydrochloric acid solution is 0.072 M."
