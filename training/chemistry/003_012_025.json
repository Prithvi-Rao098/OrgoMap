    "message_2": "To calculate the rate of diffusion of nitrogen gas in air, we can use Graham's law of diffusion, which states that the rate of diffusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molar mass. However, we need to find the molar mass of air first.\n\nAir is composed of approximately 78% nitrogen (N2), 21% oxygen (O2), and 1% argon (Ar) by volume. The molecular weights of N2, O2, and Ar are 28 g/mol, 32 g/mol, and 40 g/mol, respectively.\n\nTo find the average molar mass of air, we can use the following equation:\n\nM_air = (fraction of N2 × M_N2) + (fraction of O2 × M_O2) + (fraction of Ar × M_Ar)\n\nM_air = (0.78 × 28 g/mol) + (0.21 × 32 g/mol) + (0.01 × 40 g/mol)\nM_air ≈ 28.97 g/mol\n\nNow, we can use Graham's law of diffusion to find the rate of diffusion of nitrogen gas in air:\n\nRate_N2 / Rate_air = √(M_air / M_N2)\n\nRate_N2 / Rate_air = √(28.97 g/mol / 28 g/mol)\nRate_N2 / Rate_air ≈ 1.018\n\nSince we are given the average velocity of nitrogen gas molecules (500 m/s), we can assume that this is the rate of diffusion of nitrogen in air:\n\nRate_N2 = 500 m/s\n\nNow, we can find the rate of diffusion of air:\n\nRate_air = Rate_N2 / 1.018\nRate_air ≈ 491.16 m/s\n\nSo, the rate of diffusion of nitrogen gas in air at 25°C and 1 atm pressure is approximately 500 m/s, while the rate of diffusion of air is approximately 491.16 m/s."
