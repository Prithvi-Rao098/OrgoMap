    "message_2": "To calculate the pH of a solution containing 0.1 M hydrochloric acid (HCl), we need to first determine the concentration of hydronium ions (H₃O⁺) in the solution. HCl is a strong acid, which means it completely dissociates in water:\n\nHCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻\n\nSince HCl completely dissociates, the concentration of H⁺ ions will be equal to the concentration of HCl, which is 0.1 M.\n\nNow, we can use the formula for pH:\n\npH = -log₁₀[H⁺]\n\npH = -log₁₀(0.1)\n\npH = 1\n\nSo, the pH of the 0.1 M HCl solution is 1."
