    "message_2": "Designing drugs to effectively target and treat neurological disorders like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's requires a deep understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of these diseases. Key structural features and functional groups that should be considered when designing such drugs include:\n\n1. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability: The drug must be able to cross the BBB to reach the target site in the brain. This typically requires the drug to be lipophilic, small in size, and have a low molecular weight. Functional groups that can enhance BBB permeability include amides, esters, and ethers.\n\n2. Target specificity: The drug should selectively bind to its target protein or receptor in the brain, minimizing off-target effects. This can be achieved by incorporating functional groups that form specific interactions with the target, such as hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, or ionic interactions.\n\n3. Stability and metabolism: The drug should be stable in the body and not be rapidly metabolized or excreted. Functional groups that can improve stability include aromatic rings, amides, and sulfonamides. Additionally, the drug should not be a substrate for efflux transporters, which can limit its brain penetration.\n\n4. Solubility: The drug should have appropriate solubility in both aqueous and lipid environments to ensure proper absorption, distribution, and elimination. Functional groups that can improve solubility include hydroxyl, carboxyl, and amine groups.\n\n5. Functional groups targeting specific disease mechanisms: Depending on the specific neurological disorder, certain functional groups may be more effective in modulating the disease process. For example, in Alzheimer's disease, drugs may target beta-amyloid aggregation, tau protein phosphorylation, or cholinergic neurotransmission. Functional groups that can modulate these processes include hydroxyl, amine, and carboxyl groups.\n\nIn summary, designing drugs for neurological disorders requires a careful balance of structural features and functional groups to ensure optimal BBB permeability, target specificity, stability, solubility, and efficacy in modulating disease processes."
