    "message_2": "To balance the redox reaction between copper metal and silver nitrate solution, we first need to identify the oxidation and reduction half-reactions.\n\nOxidation half-reaction: Cu(s) → Cu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻\nReduction half-reaction: Ag⁺(aq) + e⁻ → Ag(s)\n\nNow, we need to balance the electrons in both half-reactions. Since the oxidation half-reaction has 2 electrons and the reduction half-reaction has 1 electron, we will multiply the reduction half-reaction by 2 to balance the electrons:\n\nOxidation half-reaction: Cu(s) → Cu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻\nReduction half-reaction: 2Ag⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → 2Ag(s)\n\nNow, we can combine the two half-reactions to get the balanced redox reaction:\n\nCu(s) + 2Ag⁺(aq) → Cu²⁺(aq) + 2Ag(s)\n\nFinally, we need to include the nitrate ions to complete the reaction:\n\nCu(s) + 2AgNO₃(aq) → Cu(NO₃)₂(aq) + 2Ag(s)\n\nThis is the balanced redox reaction for the reaction between copper metal and silver nitrate solution to form copper (II) nitrate and silver metal."
