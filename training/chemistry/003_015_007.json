    "message_1": "What is the percentage yield of the reaction between hydrogen gas and carbon monoxide gas to produce methanol if 50 g of carbon monoxide is reacted with excess hydrogen gas and 30 g of methanol is produced? Given that the balanced chemical equation for the reaction is: CO(g) + 2 H2(g) → CH3OH(g)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the percentage yield, we first need to determine the theoretical yield of methanol based on the given amount of carbon monoxide.\n\n1. Calculate the moles of carbon monoxide (CO) reacted:\nMolar mass of CO = 12.01 g/mol (C) + 16.00 g/mol (O) = 28.01 g/mol\nMoles of CO = mass / molar mass = 50 g / 28.01 g/mol = 1.785 moles\n\n2. Determine the moles of methanol (CH3OH) produced in the reaction:\nFrom the balanced chemical equation, 1 mole of CO reacts with 2 moles of H2 to produce 1 mole of CH3OH.\nSo, 1.785 moles of CO will produce 1.785 moles of CH3OH.\n\n3. Calculate the theoretical yield of methanol:\nMolar mass of CH3OH = 12.01 g/mol (C) + 4.03 g/mol (H) + 16.00 g/mol (O) = 32.04 g/mol\nTheoretical yield = moles of CH3OH × molar mass = 1.785 moles × 32.04 g/mol = 57.19 g\n\n4. Calculate the percentage yield:\nPercentage yield = (actual yield / theoretical yield) × 100\nPercentage yield = (30 g / 57.19 g) × 100 = 52.47%\n\nThe percentage yield of the reaction is approximately 52.47%."
