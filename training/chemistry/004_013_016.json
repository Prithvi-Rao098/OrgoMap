    "message_1": "What is the amount of copper (Cu) in a sample of brass weighing 10.5 grams, if the sample was dissolved in sulfuric acid and the resulting Cu2+ ions were fully reduced using coulometry, requiring a total charge of 1150 C? (Assume 100% current efficiency and Faraday's constant as 96500 C/mol.)",
    "message_2": "To determine the amount of copper in the sample, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the moles of electrons transferred during the reduction process.\n2. Determine the moles of copper reduced.\n3. Calculate the mass of copper in the sample.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the moles of electrons transferred\nTotal charge (Q) = 1150 C\nFaraday's constant (F) = 96500 C/mol\n\nMoles of electrons (n) = Q / F\nn = 1150 C / 96500 C/mol\nn = 0.0119 mol of electrons\n\nStep 2: Determine the moles of copper reduced\nCopper ions (Cu2+) require 2 electrons to be reduced to copper metal (Cu):\n\nCu2+ + 2e- â†’ Cu\n\nSo, the moles of copper reduced will be half the moles of electrons:\n\nMoles of Cu = 0.0119 mol of electrons / 2\nMoles of Cu = 0.00595 mol\n\nStep 3: Calculate the mass of copper in the sample\nThe molar mass of copper (Cu) is 63.55 g/mol.\n\nMass of Cu = moles of Cu * molar mass of Cu\nMass of Cu = 0.00595 mol * 63.55 g/mol\nMass of Cu = 0.378 g\n\nTherefore, the amount of copper in the 10.5 g brass sample is approximately 0.378 g."
