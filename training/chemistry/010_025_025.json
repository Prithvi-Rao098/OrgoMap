    "message_1": "What is the activation energy of an electrochemical reaction involving the oxidation of copper on a platinum electrode, if the reaction rate constant at 25Â°C is 2.5 x 10^-4 mol L^-1 s^-1 and the activation energy for the reaction is 64 kJ/mol?",
    "message_2": "The activation energy (Ea) for the reaction is already given as 64 kJ/mol. Therefore, there is no need to calculate it. The activation energy for the electrochemical reaction involving the oxidation of copper on a platinum electrode is 64 kJ/mol."
