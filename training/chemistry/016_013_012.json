(Assume the specific heat capacity of the solution is 4.18 J/g째C and the density is 1 g/mL. The molar mass of Na2SO4 is 142.04 g/mol.)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change of hydration of sodium sulfate, we need to first determine the heat absorbed by the solution and then divide it by the moles of Na2SO4.\n\n1. Calculate the moles of Na2SO4:\nmoles = mass / molar mass\nmoles = 10 g / 142.04 g/mol = 0.0704 mol\n\n2. Calculate the total mass of the solution:\nmass_solution = mass_Na2SO4 + mass_water\nmass_solution = 10 g + 50 g = 60 g\n\n3. Calculate the heat absorbed by the solution:\nSince the final temperature of the solution is 25째C, we can assume that the initial temperature of both the anhydrous sodium sulfate and water is also 25째C. Therefore, there is no temperature change, and the heat absorbed by the solution is 0 J.\n\n4. Calculate the enthalpy change of hydration:\nenthalpy_change = heat_absorbed / moles_Na2SO4\nenthalpy_change = 0 J / 0.0704 mol = 0 J/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change of hydration of sodium sulfate is 0 J/mol under these conditions."
