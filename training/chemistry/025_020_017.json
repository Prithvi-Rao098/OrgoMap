    "message_2": "There are several ways to increase exposure to chemistry in everyday life for non-science majors:\n\n1. Public outreach and awareness campaigns: Organize public events, workshops, and seminars to educate people about the importance of chemistry in daily life. Collaborate with schools, colleges, and community centers to host these events.\n\n2. Social media and online platforms: Utilize social media platforms and create engaging content like videos, infographics, and articles to explain chemistry concepts in a simple and relatable manner. Share real-life examples and applications of chemistry that people can relate to.\n\n3. Collaborate with popular media: Work with television shows, movies, and documentaries to incorporate accurate chemistry concepts and portrayals. This can help in raising awareness and interest in the subject.\n\n4. Hands-on activities and experiments: Organize interactive workshops and science fairs where people can participate in simple chemistry experiments using household items. This will help them understand the practical applications of chemistry in daily life.\n\n5. Integrate chemistry into other subjects: Encourage interdisciplinary learning by integrating chemistry concepts into subjects like art, history, and literature. This can help non-science majors appreciate the relevance of chemistry in various aspects of life.\n\n6. Develop educational resources: Create engaging and accessible educational resources, such as books, videos, and online courses, specifically designed for non-science majors. These resources should focus on the practical applications of chemistry and its impact on everyday life.\n\n7. Promote science communication: Encourage chemists and chemistry students to participate in science communication activities, such as writing articles, giving public talks, and creating educational content. This will help bridge the gap between the scientific community and the general public.\n\n8. Collaborate with museums and science centers: Work with museums and science centers to develop interactive exhibits and displays that showcase the importance of chemistry in daily life. This can help engage and educate visitors of all ages and backgrounds.\n\n9. Encourage lifelong learning: Promote the idea that learning about chemistry is not limited to formal education. Encourage people to explore chemistry through hobbies, clubs, and online resources.\n\n10. Celebrate chemistry: Participate in and promote events like National Chemistry Week and the International Year of Chemistry to raise awareness and generate excitement about the subject."
