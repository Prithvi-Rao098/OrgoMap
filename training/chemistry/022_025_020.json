    "message_2": "To find the concentration of the HCl solution, we can use the concept of stoichiometry and the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between NaOH and HCl:\n\nNaOH + HCl → NaCl + H2O\n\nAt the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH and HCl are equal. We can use the formula:\n\nmoles = volume (L) × concentration (M)\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of NaOH:\n\nmoles of NaOH = volume (L) × concentration (M)\nmoles of NaOH = 0.025 L × 0.100 M\nmoles of NaOH = 0.0025 mol\n\nSince the moles of NaOH and HCl are equal at the equivalence point, we have 0.0025 mol of HCl. Now we can find the concentration of the HCl solution:\n\nconcentration (M) = moles / volume (L)\nconcentration (M) = 0.0025 mol / 0.035 L\nconcentration (M) = 0.0714 M\n\nThe concentration of the HCl solution is 0.0714 M."
