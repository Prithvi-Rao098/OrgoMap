    "message_2": "C4H10O can have three structural isomers: 1-butanol, 2-butanol, and tert-butyl alcohol (or 2-methyl-2-propanol). These isomers differ in the arrangement of atoms within the molecule, which leads to differences in their physical and chemical properties.\n\n1. 1-Butanol (butan-1-ol):\nStructure: CH3-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH\nIn 1-butanol, the hydroxyl (OH) group is attached to the first carbon atom in the straight chain of four carbon atoms. \n\n2. 2-Butanol (butan-2-ol):\nStructure: CH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3\nIn 2-butanol, the hydroxyl group is attached to the second carbon atom in the straight chain of four carbon atoms.\n\n3. tert-Butyl alcohol (2-methyl-2-propanol):\nStructure: (CH3)3C-OH\nIn tert-butyl alcohol, the hydroxyl group is attached to a central carbon atom that is bonded to three methyl (CH3) groups.\n\nPhysical properties:\nThe differences in the arrangement of atoms in these isomers lead to variations in their boiling points, melting points, and solubility in water. Generally, 1-butanol has the highest boiling point, followed by 2-butanol, and then tert-butyl alcohol. This is due to the strength of hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl groups in 1-butanol and 2-butanol, which is weaker in tert-butyl alcohol due to steric hindrance caused by the bulky methyl groups. The solubility in water follows the same trend, with 1-butanol being the most soluble and tert-butyl alcohol being the least soluble.\n\nChemical properties:\nThe chemical properties of these isomers are influenced by the position of the hydroxyl group and the steric hindrance around it. For example, the reactivity of these alcohols in nucleophilic substitution reactions or oxidation reactions can vary. 1-butanol and 2-butanol can be easily oxidized to their corresponding aldehydes and ketones, while tert-butyl alcohol is resistant to oxidation due to the absence of hydrogen atoms on the carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group. Additionally, the acidity of these alcohols can be affected by the electron-donating effect of the alkyl groups, with tert-butyl alcohol being the least acidic due to the presence of three electron-donating methyl groups."
