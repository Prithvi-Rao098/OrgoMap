    "message_2": "To find the molarity of the HCl solution, we can use the formula:\n\nM1V1 = M2V2\n\nwhere M1 is the molarity of the HCl solution, V1 is the volume of the HCl solution, M2 is the molarity of the NaOH solution, and V2 is the volume of the NaOH solution.\n\nWe are given:\nV1 = 25 ml (volume of HCl solution)\nM2 = 0.1 M (molarity of NaOH solution)\nV2 = 35 ml (volume of NaOH solution)\n\nWe need to find M1 (molarity of HCl solution). Plugging the given values into the formula:\n\nM1 * 25 ml = 0.1 M * 35 ml\n\nM1 * 25 ml = 3.5\n\nNow, we can solve for M1:\n\nM1 = 3.5 / 25 ml\n\nM1 = 0.14 M\n\nSo, the molarity (concentration) of the HCl solution is 0.14 M."
