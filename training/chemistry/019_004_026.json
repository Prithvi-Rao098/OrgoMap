    "message_2": "To calculate the change in entropy for the complete combustion of 1 mole of methane gas (CH4) in oxygen gas (O2) at constant pressure and 298 K, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nCH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(g)\n\nNext, we need the standard molar entropies (S°) for each species involved in the reaction at 298 K. These values can be found in a standard thermodynamic table:\n\nS°(CH4) = 186.3 J/mol·K\nS°(O2) = 205.2 J/mol·K\nS°(CO2) = 213.8 J/mol·K\nS°(H2O) = 188.8 J/mol·K\n\nNow we can calculate the change in entropy (ΔS) for the reaction using the following equation:\n\nΔS = Σ [S°(products)] - Σ [S°(reactants)]\n\nΔS = [1 × S°(CO2) + 2 × S°(H2O)] - [1 × S°(CH4) + 2 × S°(O2)]\n\nΔS = [1 × 213.8 + 2 × 188.8] - [1 × 186.3 + 2 × 205.2]\n\nΔS = [213.8 + 377.6] - [186.3 + 410.4]\n\nΔS = 591.4 - 596.7\n\nΔS = -5.3 J/mol·K\n\nThe change in entropy for the complete combustion of 1 mole of methane gas (CH4) in oxygen gas (O2) at constant pressure and 298 K is -5.3 J/mol·K."
