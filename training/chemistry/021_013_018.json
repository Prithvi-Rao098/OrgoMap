    "message_2": "The Lewis structure for carbon dioxide (CO2) is:\n\nO = C = O\n\nIn this structure, the carbon atom (C) is in the center and forms double bonds with each of the two oxygen atoms (O). The carbon atom has four valence electrons, and each oxygen atom has six valence electrons. By forming two double bonds, the carbon atom shares a total of four electrons with the oxygen atoms, and each oxygen atom shares two electrons with the carbon atom. This results in a full octet for each atom, satisfying the octet rule."
