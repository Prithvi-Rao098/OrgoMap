    "message_2": "To determine the bond order and total number of valence electrons for ethene (C2H4), we first need to look at its molecular orbital diagram.\n\nEthene has two carbon atoms and four hydrogen atoms. Each carbon atom has 4 valence electrons, and each hydrogen atom has 1 valence electron. Therefore, the total number of valence electrons in ethene is:\n\n(2 carbon atoms × 4 valence electrons) + (4 hydrogen atoms × 1 valence electron) = 8 + 4 = 12 valence electrons.\n\nNow, let's determine the bond order. In ethene, each carbon atom forms a sigma bond with two hydrogen atoms and a sigma bond with the other carbon atom. Additionally, there is a pi bond between the two carbon atoms. The bond order can be calculated as:\n\nBond order = (Number of bonding electrons - Number of antibonding electrons) / 2\n\nIn ethene, there are 12 bonding electrons (8 from the sigma bonds and 4 from the pi bond) and no antibonding electrons. Therefore, the bond order is:\n\nBond order = (12 - 0) / 2 = 6\n\nHowever, this bond order represents the total bond order for the entire molecule. To find the bond order between the two carbon atoms, we need to consider only the sigma and pi bonds between them:\n\nBond order (C-C) = (2 sigma electrons + 4 pi electrons) / 2 = 3\n\nSo, the bond order between the two carbon atoms in ethene is 3, and the total number of valence electrons is 12."
