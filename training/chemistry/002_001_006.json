    "message_2": "To calculate the mass of NaOH required, we can use the formula:\n\nmass = volume × molarity × molar mass\n\nFirst, we need to find the molar mass of NaOH. The atomic masses of the elements are as follows:\n\n- Sodium (Na): 22.99 g/mol\n- Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol\n- Hydrogen (H): 1.01 g/mol\n\nSo, the molar mass of NaOH is:\n\nNaOH = 22.99 g/mol (Na) + 16.00 g/mol (O) + 1.01 g/mol (H) = 40.00 g/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the mass of NaOH required:\n\nmass = (250 mL) × (0.15 mol/L) × (40.00 g/mol)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the volume from mL to L:\n\n250 mL = 250/1000 L = 0.250 L\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nmass = (0.250 L) × (0.15 mol/L) × (40.00 g/mol) = 1.50 g\n\nSo, the student needs 1.50 grams of solid NaOH to prepare 250 mL of 0.15 M NaOH solution."
