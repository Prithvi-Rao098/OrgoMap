    "message_2": "The power output of a lithium-ion battery can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPower (P) = Voltage (V) × Current (I)\n\nGiven the electrode potential (voltage) of 3.7 volts and a current flow of 2 amperes:\n\nP = 3.7 V × 2 A\n\nP = 7.4 watts\n\nThe power output of the lithium-ion battery is 7.4 watts."
