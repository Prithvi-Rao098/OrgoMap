    "message_2": "To calculate the mass of copper deposited on the cathode, we can use Faraday's law of electrolysis, which states that the mass of a substance deposited or dissolved at an electrode is directly proportional to the amount of charge passed through the electrolyte.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total charge passed through the solution. The charge (Q) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nQ = I × t\n\nwhere I is the current (5 A) and t is the time (2 hours). Since the time is given in hours, we need to convert it to seconds:\n\n2 hours × (3600 seconds/hour) = 7200 seconds\n\nNow, we can calculate the charge:\n\nQ = 5 A × 7200 s = 36000 C\n\nNext, we need to find the number of moles of electrons (n) passed through the solution using the Faraday constant (F):\n\nn = Q / F\n\nn = 36000 C / 96485 C/mol ≈ 0.373 mol\n\nSince copper (II) ions require 2 moles of electrons to be reduced to copper metal (Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu), we can find the number of moles of copper deposited (n_Cu) as follows:\n\nn_Cu = n / 2\n\nn_Cu = 0.373 mol / 2 ≈ 0.1865 mol\n\nFinally, we can calculate the mass of copper deposited (m_Cu) using the atomic mass of copper (M_Cu = 63.5 g/mol):\n\nm_Cu = n_Cu × M_Cu\n\nm_Cu = 0.1865 mol × 63.5 g/mol ≈ 11.84 g\n\nSo, the mass of copper deposited on the cathode is approximately 11.84 grams."
