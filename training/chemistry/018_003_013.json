    "message_2": "The reaction rate of the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is influenced by temperature, among other factors. According to the Arrhenius equation, the reaction rate increases with an increase in temperature. The equation is as follows:\n\nk = Ae^(-Ea/RT)\n\nwhere:\nk = reaction rate constant\nA = pre-exponential factor (a constant)\nEa = activation energy (energy required for the reaction to occur)\nR = gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\nT = temperature (in Kelvin)\n\nAs the temperature (T) increases, the exponential term e^(-Ea/RT) becomes larger, which in turn increases the reaction rate constant (k). This means that the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide occurs faster at higher temperatures.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the relationship between temperature and reaction rate is not linear. The reaction rate typically doubles or triples for every 10°C increase in temperature, depending on the specific reaction and its activation energy.\n\nIn addition to temperature, other factors such as the concentration of hydrogen peroxide, the presence of catalysts (e.g., manganese dioxide or potassium iodide), and the pH of the solution can also affect the reaction rate of the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide."
