    "message_2": "To find the maximum power output of a Daniell cell, we first need to determine the cell potential under the given conditions. The Nernst equation can be used to calculate the cell potential:\n\nE_cell = E°_cell - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\n\nwhere E°_cell is the standard cell potential, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin (assuming standard conditions, T = 298 K), n is the number of electrons transferred (for a Daniell cell, n = 2), F is the Faraday constant (96485 C/mol), and Q is the reaction quotient.\n\nFor a Daniell cell, the standard cell potential (E°_cell) is 1.1 V. The reaction quotient (Q) can be calculated using the given concentrations of copper and zinc ions:\n\nQ = [Cu²⁺]/[Zn²⁺] = (0.1 M)/(1 M) = 0.1\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Nernst equation:\n\nE_cell = 1.1 V - (8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K) / (2 * 96485 C/mol) * ln(0.1)\nE_cell ≈ 1.1 V - 0.0129 V\nE_cell ≈ 1.0871 V\n\nNow that we have the cell potential, we can calculate the maximum power output using the formula:\n\nP_max = 1/4 * n * F * E_cell² / R * T\n\nP_max = 1/4 * 2 * 96485 C/mol * (1.0871 V)² / (8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K)\nP_max ≈ 0.5 * 96485 C/mol * 1.1826 V² / 2454.972 J/mol\nP_max ≈ 56.91 W/mol\n\nThe maximum power output of the Daniell cell under the given conditions is approximately 56.91 W/mol."
