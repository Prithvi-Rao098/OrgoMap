    "message_2": "Benzene (C6H6) is an aromatic compound with a hexagonal ring structure. It has two possible resonance structures. In both structures, each carbon atom is bonded to one hydrogen atom and two other carbon atoms. The difference between the two resonance structures lies in the positioning of the double bonds between the carbon atoms.\n\n1. In the first resonance structure, the double bonds are positioned between alternating carbon atoms, with single bonds between the remaining carbon atoms. This structure can be represented as:\n\n   H     H     H\n    \\    / \\    /\n     C=C-C=C-C=C\n    /    \\ /    \\\n   H     H     H\n\n2. In the second resonance structure, the double bonds are shifted by one carbon atom, resulting in a different arrangement of double and single bonds:\n\n   H     H     H\n    \\    / \\    /\n     C-C=C-C=C-C\n    /    \\ /    \\\n   H     H     H\n\nThese two resonance structures contribute equally to the overall structure of benzene, and the true structure is a hybrid of both. The double bonds are evenly distributed across the ring, giving benzene its characteristic stability and aromatic properties."
