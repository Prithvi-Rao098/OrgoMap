    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the following formula:\n\nΔH° = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH° is the standard enthalpy change, and ΔHf° is the standard enthalpy of formation.\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\nC2H5OH(l) + 3O2(g) → 2CO2(g) + 3H2O(l)\n\nThe standard enthalpies of formation are:\n\nC2H5OH(l): -277.6 kJ/mol\nCO2(g): -393.5 kJ/mol\nH2O(l): -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nΔH° = [2 × (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 3 × (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [(-277.6 kJ/mol) + 3 × 0 kJ/mol]\n\nNote that the standard enthalpy of formation for O2(g) is 0 kJ/mol since it is in its standard state.\n\nΔH° = [-787.0 kJ + (-857.4 kJ)] - (-277.6 kJ)\nΔH° = (-1644.4 kJ) + 277.6 kJ\nΔH° = -1366.8 kJ\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the reaction is -1366.8 kJ."
