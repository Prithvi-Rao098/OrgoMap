    "message_2": "The energy released during the nuclear fission of Uranium-235 can be calculated using the energy released per fission event and the number of atoms in 1 kg of Uranium-235.\n\nThe energy released per fission event of Uranium-235 is approximately 200 MeV (Mega-electron volts). To convert this to Joules, we can use the conversion factor: 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^(-19) J. \n\n200 MeV = 200 x 10^6 eV = 200 x 10^6 x 1.602 x 10^(-19) J ≈ 3.204 x 10^(-11) J per fission event.\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of Uranium-235 atoms in 1 kg. The molar mass of Uranium-235 is 235 g/mol. \n\n1 kg of Uranium-235 = 1000 g\n\nNumber of moles = (1000 g) / (235 g/mol) ≈ 4.255 moles\n\nUsing Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol), we can find the number of Uranium-235 atoms:\n\nNumber of atoms = 4.255 moles x 6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol ≈ 2.561 x 10^24 atoms\n\nFinally, we can calculate the total energy released:\n\nTotal energy = (2.561 x 10^24 atoms) x (3.204 x 10^(-11) J/atom) ≈ 8.2 x 10^13 Joules\n\nSo, the energy released when 1 kg of Uranium-235 undergoes nuclear fission is approximately 8.2 x 10^13 Joules."
