Given the following equation: \n\nFe^2+ + Cu^2+ ⇌ Fe^3+ + Cu^+ \n\nInitial concentrations of reactants and products: \n\n[Fe^2+] = 0.1 M \n\n[Cu^2+] = 0.1 M \n\n[Fe^3+] = 0.1 M \n\n[Cu^+] = 0.1 M \n\nKc = 1.2 x 10^-3 at 25°C.",
    "message_2": "To find the new equilibrium concentrations, we will first write the expression for the equilibrium constant (Kc) and then use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the changes in concentrations.\n\nThe equilibrium expression for the given reaction is:\n\nKc = ([Fe³⁺][Cu⁺])/([Fe²⁺][Cu²⁺])\n\nGiven Kc = 1.2 x 10⁻³\n\nNow, let's create an ICE table:\n\n...........Fe²⁺ + Cu²⁺ ⇌ Fe³⁺ + Cu⁺\nInitial....0.1.....0.1.......0.1.......0.1\nChange...-2x.....-2x........+x........+x\nFinal......0.1-2x..0.1-2x....0.1+x.....0.1+x\n\nSince the concentration of the reactants is increased by a factor of 2, the change in the concentration of Fe²⁺ and Cu²⁺ is -2x, while the change in the concentration of Fe³⁺ and Cu⁺ is +x.\n\nNow, substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the Kc expression:\n\n1.2 x 10⁻³ = ((0.1+x)(0.1+x))/((0.1-2x)(0.1-2x))\n\nSolving this quadratic equation for x:\n\n(0.1+x)² = 1.2 x 10⁻³ (0.1-2x)²\n\nExpanding and simplifying the equation:\n\n0.01 + 0.2x + x² = 1.2 x 10⁻³ (0.01 - 0.4x + 4x²)\n\n0.01 + 0.2x + x² = 1.2 x 10⁻² - 4.8 x 10⁻³x + 4.8 x 10⁻³x²\n\nMultiplying by 10³ to remove decimals:\n\n1000 + 2000x + 1000x² = 120 - 4800x + 4800x²\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n5800x² - 6800x + 120 = 0\n\nDividing by 100:\n\n58x² - 68x + 1.2 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nx = (68 ± √(68² - 4 * 58 * 1.2)) / (2 * 58)\n\nx ≈ 0.0204\n\nSince x is positive, we will use the positive value of x.\n\nNow, we can find the new equilibrium concentrations:\n\n[Fe²⁺] = 0.1 - 2x ≈ 0.1 - 2(0.0204) ≈ 0.0592 M\n[Cu²⁺] = 0.1 - 2x ≈ 0.1 - 2(0.0204) ≈ 0.0592 M\n[Fe³⁺] = 0.1 + x ≈ 0.1 + 0.0204 ≈ 0.1204 M\n[Cu⁺] = 0.1 + x ≈ 0.1 + 0.0204 ≈ 0.1204 M\n\nSo, the new equilibrium concentrations are:\n\n[Fe²⁺] ≈ 0.0592 M\n[Cu²⁺] ≈ 0.0592 M\n[Fe³⁺] ≈ 0.1204 M\n[Cu⁺] ≈ 0.1204 M"
