    "message_2": "We are given the standard enthalpy of formation (ΔH°f) and the standard entropy change (ΔS°) for the formation of 1 mole of Fe2O3 from its elements in their standard state. The reaction is:\n\nFe(s) + 1.5 O2(g) → Fe2O3(s)\n\nWe are asked to calculate the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) and the standard entropy change (ΔS°) for this reaction.\n\nSince we are given the standard enthalpy of formation (ΔH°f) for the reaction, we can directly use it as the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the reaction:\n\nΔH° = -824.2 kJ/mol\n\nFor the standard entropy change (ΔS°), we are given the value directly as well:\n\nΔS° = 87.4 J/mol·K\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the formation of 1 mole of Fe2O3 from its elements in their standard state is -824.2 kJ/mol, and the standard entropy change (ΔS°) is 87.4 J/mol·K."
