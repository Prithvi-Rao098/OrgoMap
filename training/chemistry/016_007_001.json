    "message_2": "The standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) of a compound is the change in enthalpy when 1 mole of the compound is formed from its elements in their standard states at a specified temperature, usually 298 K. In this case, we are given the standard enthalpy of formation for water (H2O) as -285.83 kJ/mol.\n\nSince we are asked for the standard enthalpy of formation of water (H2O) at 298 K, and we are already given that value, the answer is:\n\nΔHf° [H2O (l)] = -285.83 kJ/mol"
