    "message_1": "What functional groups are present in compound X, and what are their respective absorption frequencies in infrared spectroscopy? How can this information be used to determine the identity of compound X?",
    "message_2": "To answer this question, we need the structure or formula of compound X. However, I can provide a general explanation of how functional groups and their absorption frequencies in infrared (IR) spectroscopy can be used to determine the identity of a compound.\n\nInfrared spectroscopy is a technique used to identify functional groups present in a compound by measuring the absorption of infrared radiation at different frequencies. Each functional group has a characteristic absorption frequency or range of frequencies, which corresponds to the energy required to excite the vibrations of the chemical bonds within the group.\n\nSome common functional groups and their approximate absorption frequencies in IR spectroscopy are:\n\n1. Hydroxyl group (O-H): 3200-3600 cm⁻¹ (broad)\n2. Carboxylic acid (O-H): 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ (broad)\n3. Amine (N-H): 3300-3500 cm⁻¹\n4. Alkene (C=C): 1620-1680 cm⁻¹\n5. Carbonyl (C=O): 1680-1750 cm⁻¹\n6. Nitrile (C≡N): 2210-2260 cm⁻¹\n7. Alkyne (C≡C): 2100-2250 cm⁻¹\n\nTo determine the identity of compound X, you would first obtain its IR spectrum by exposing the compound to infrared radiation and measuring the absorption at different frequencies. Then, you would analyze the spectrum to identify the characteristic absorption peaks corresponding to specific functional groups. By comparing the observed absorption frequencies with the known frequencies for various functional groups, you can deduce which functional groups are present in the compound.\n\nOnce you have identified the functional groups, you can use this information along with other analytical techniques (such as NMR spectroscopy or mass spectrometry) to determine the complete structure and identity of compound X."
