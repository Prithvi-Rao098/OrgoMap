    "message_2": "To find the concentration of the HCl solution, we can use the concept of titration and the reaction between HCl and NaOH. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction between HCl and NaOH is:\n\nHCl (aq) + NaOH (aq) → NaCl (aq) + H2O (l)\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that the mole ratio between HCl and NaOH is 1:1. \n\nNow, we can use the information given to find the moles of NaOH and then use the mole ratio to find the moles of HCl. \n\nMoles of NaOH = Molarity × Volume\nMoles of NaOH = 0.100 M × 35.80 mL × (1 L / 1000 mL) = 0.00358 moles\n\nSince the mole ratio between HCl and NaOH is 1:1, the moles of HCl are equal to the moles of NaOH:\n\nMoles of HCl = 0.00358 moles\n\nNow, we can find the concentration of the HCl solution using the formula:\n\nMolarity = Moles / Volume\n\nMolarity of HCl = 0.00358 moles / (25.00 mL × (1 L / 1000 mL))\nMolarity of HCl = 0.00358 moles / 0.025 L = 0.1432 M\n\nTherefore, the concentration of the HCl solution is 0.1432 M."
