    "message_1": "A 0.1 M solution of ammonia (NH3) has a pH of 11.64 at room temperature. If sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is added to this solution such that the concentration of OH- ions becomes 0.01 M, what will be the new pH of the solution? (Assume that the dissociation of water can be ignored)",
    "message_2": "To find the new pH of the solution, we first need to determine the new concentration of OH- ions after adding NaOH. Since NaOH is a strong base, it will dissociate completely in water, and the concentration of OH- ions will be the sum of the concentrations from NH3 and NaOH.\n\nFirst, we need to find the concentration of OH- ions from the NH3 solution. We can do this using the pOH, which is related to the pH by the following equation:\n\npOH = 14 - pH\n\nFor the NH3 solution, the pOH is:\n\npOH = 14 - 11.64 = 2.36\n\nNow, we can find the concentration of OH- ions from the NH3 solution using the following equation:\n\n[OH-] = 10^(-pOH)\n\n[OH-] = 10^(-2.36) = 4.57 x 10^(-3) M\n\nNow, we can find the total concentration of OH- ions after adding NaOH:\n\n[OH-]_total = [OH-]_NH3 + [OH-]_NaOH = 4.57 x 10^(-3) M + 0.01 M = 0.01457 M\n\nNow, we can find the new pOH of the solution:\n\npOH_new = -log10([OH-]_total) = -log10(0.01457) = 1.836\n\nFinally, we can find the new pH of the solution:\n\npH_new = 14 - pOH_new = 14 - 1.836 = 12.164\n\nSo, the new pH of the solution after adding NaOH is 12.164."
