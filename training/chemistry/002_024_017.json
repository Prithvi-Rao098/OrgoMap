    "message_1": "What is the color of iron(III) chloride, FeCl3, in aqueous solution, and how does it change with increasing concentration?",
    "message_2": "Iron(III) chloride, FeCl3, in aqueous solution appears as a yellow to orange-brown color. As the concentration of the solution increases, the color becomes more intense and tends towards a deeper orange-brown hue. This color change is due to the presence of Fe3+ ions in the solution, which absorb light in the visible region of the spectrum, giving the solution its characteristic color."
