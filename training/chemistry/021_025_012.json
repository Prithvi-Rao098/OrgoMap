    "message_2": "A chemist can identify the type of bonding in a solid by examining its specific properties. Here are three examples of properties that can help distinguish between ionic, covalent, and metallic bonding:\n\n1. Electrical Conductivity: \n- Ionic solids typically do not conduct electricity in their solid state, but they can conduct when dissolved in water or melted, as their ions become free to move. For example, table salt (NaCl) is an ionic solid that does not conduct electricity in its solid form but does when dissolved in water.\n- Covalent solids generally do not conduct electricity, as they consist of neutral atoms held together by covalent bonds, and there are no free electrons or ions to carry a charge. An example of a covalent solid is diamond, which is composed of carbon atoms covalently bonded to each other and does not conduct electricity.\n- Metallic solids are good conductors of electricity, as they have a \"sea\" of delocalized electrons that can move freely throughout the lattice, allowing for the flow of electric current. For example, copper (Cu) is a metallic solid that conducts electricity well.\n\n2. Melting and Boiling Points:\n- Ionic solids usually have high melting and boiling points due to the strong electrostatic forces between their oppositely charged ions. For example, magnesium oxide (MgO) is an ionic solid with a high melting point of 2852째C.\n- Covalent solids can have a wide range of melting and boiling points, depending on the strength of their covalent bonds. For example, ice (H2O) has a relatively low melting point of 0째C due to its hydrogen bonding, while diamond has an extremely high melting point of around 3550째C due to its strong covalent bonds.\n- Metallic solids generally have high melting and boiling points due to the strong metallic bonds formed by the delocalized electrons. For example, iron (Fe) has a high melting point of 1538째C.\n\n3. Hardness and Brittleness:\n- Ionic solids are generally hard and brittle, as their lattice structure can be easily disrupted by the movement of ions, causing the solid to break. For example, calcium fluoride (CaF2) is an ionic solid that is hard but brittle.\n- Covalent solids can be either very hard, like diamond, or relatively soft, like graphite, depending on the arrangement of their covalent bonds. Diamond is extremely hard due to its strong covalent bonds and rigid lattice structure, while graphite is softer because its carbon atoms are arranged in layers held together by weaker van der Waals forces.\n- Metallic solids are generally malleable and ductile, as their delocalized electrons allow the metal atoms to slide past each other without breaking the metallic bonds. For example, gold (Au) is a metallic solid that is both malleable and ductile."
