    "message_2": "In the compound SO3 (sulfur trioxide), the oxidation state of sulfur is +6. \n\nHere's how to determine it:\n\n1. Oxygen typically has an oxidation state of -2.\n2. There are three oxygen atoms in SO3, so their combined oxidation state is 3 x (-2) = -6.\n3. The overall charge of the compound SO3 is neutral (0).\n4. To balance the oxidation states and achieve a neutral charge, the oxidation state of sulfur must be +6."
