    "message_1": "A student wishes to prepare a buffer solution by adding 0.20 moles of acetic acid (Ka = 1.8 x 10^-5) and 0.20 moles of sodium acetate in 1 liter of solution. The student adds 0.05 moles of hydrochloric acid (HCl) to the solution. Calculate the effect of adding the buffer on the equilibrium position of the acid-base reaction and determine the new pH of the solution.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the effect of adding the buffer on the equilibrium position of the acid-base reaction and determine the new pH of the solution, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n\nwhere pH is the pH of the solution, pKa is the negative logarithm of the acid dissociation constant (Ka), [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base, and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid.\n\nFirst, we need to find the pKa of acetic acid:\n\npKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.8 x 10^-5) = 4.74\n\nNext, we need to determine the new concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion after adding 0.05 moles of HCl. The HCl will react with the acetate ion (CH3COO-) to form acetic acid (CH3COOH) and chloride ion (Cl-):\n\nCH3COO- + HCl -> CH3COOH + Cl-\n\nSince 0.05 moles of HCl are added, 0.05 moles of CH3COO- will react to form 0.05 moles of CH3COOH. The new concentrations are:\n\n[CH3COO-] = 0.20 moles - 0.05 moles = 0.15 moles\n[CH3COOH] = 0.20 moles + 0.05 moles = 0.25 moles\n\nNow we can plug these values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = 4.74 + log(0.15/0.25) = 4.74 - 0.40 = 4.34\n\nThe new pH of the solution after adding 0.05 moles of HCl is 4.34."
