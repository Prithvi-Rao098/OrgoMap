    "message_2": "The sensitivity of a Geiger-Muller counter for detecting ionizing radiation is not a fixed value, as it depends on the specific model of the counter, the type of radiation being detected (alpha, beta, gamma, or X-rays), and the energy of the radiation. \n\nHowever, a common conversion factor for Geiger-Muller counters is approximately 100 counts per minute (CPM) per microsievert per hour (µSv/h). To convert this to counts per minute per microsievert, we need to divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):\n\n100 CPM / (µSv/h) * (1 h / 60 min) ≈ 1.67 CPM per µSv\n\nSo, the sensitivity of a typical Geiger-Muller counter for detecting ionizing radiation is approximately 1.67 counts per minute per microsievert. Keep in mind that this is a rough estimate and can vary depending on the specific counter and radiation type."
