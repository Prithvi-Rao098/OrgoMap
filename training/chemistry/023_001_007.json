    "message_2": "The optimal ratio of salicylic acid and acetic anhydride to produce the highest yield of aspirin in the synthesis process is 1:1, based on their stoichiometry in the balanced chemical equation:\n\nC7H6O3 (salicylic acid) + C4H6O3 (acetic anhydride) â†’ C9H8O4 (aspirin) + C2H4O2 (acetic acid)\n\nHowever, in practice, it is common to use a slight excess of acetic anhydride (e.g., 1:1.1 or 1:1.2) to ensure complete conversion of salicylic acid to aspirin and to compensate for any potential side reactions or losses during the synthesis process."
