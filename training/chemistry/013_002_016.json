    "message_2": "To calculate the surface tension of the liquid, we can use the formula for the force exerted by surface tension on the wire:\n\nF = 2 * L * T\n\nwhere F is the force exerted by surface tension, L is the length of the wire, and T is the surface tension of the liquid.\n\nThe weight of the liquid (0.1 N) is balanced by the force exerted by surface tension, so we can write:\n\n0.1 N = 2 * 20 cm * T\n\nNow, we can solve for T:\n\nT = (0.1 N) / (2 * 20 cm)\nT = 0.1 N / 40 cm\nT = 0.0025 N/cm\n\nThe surface tension of the liquid is 0.0025 N/cm."
