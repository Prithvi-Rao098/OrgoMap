    "message_2": "To find the pH of the buffer solution, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log ([A-]/[HA])\n\nwhere pH is the pH of the solution, pKa is the acid dissociation constant, [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate ion), and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid (acetic acid).\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of acetic acid and sodium acetate in the solution:\n\nmoles of acetic acid (HA) = volume (L) × concentration (M) = 0.050 L × 0.25 M = 0.0125 mol\nmoles of sodium acetate (A-) = volume (L) × concentration (M) = 0.025 L × 0.10 M = 0.0025 mol\n\nNext, we need to find the total volume of the solution:\n\ntotal volume = volume of acetic acid + volume of sodium acetate = 0.050 L + 0.025 L = 0.075 L\n\nNow, we can find the concentrations of acetic acid and sodium acetate in the final solution:\n\n[HA] = moles of acetic acid / total volume = 0.0125 mol / 0.075 L = 0.1667 M\n[A-] = moles of sodium acetate / total volume = 0.0025 mol / 0.075 L = 0.0333 M\n\nFinally, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH of the solution:\n\npH = pKa + log ([A-]/[HA]) = 4.76 + log (0.0333/0.1667) = 4.76 - 1.25 = 3.51\n\nThe pH of the buffer solution is approximately 3.51."
