    "message_2": "In the compound NH4NO3, there are two different nitrogen atoms with different oxidation states. \n\nIn the ammonium ion (NH4+), the nitrogen atom has an oxidation state of -3. This is because hydrogen has an oxidation state of +1, and the overall charge of the ion is +1. So, the oxidation state of nitrogen in NH4+ is -3.\n\nIn the nitrate ion (NO3-), the nitrogen atom has an oxidation state of +5. This is because oxygen has an oxidation state of -2, and there are three oxygen atoms, making a total of -6. The overall charge of the ion is -1, so the oxidation state of nitrogen in NO3- is +5.\n\nNow let's analyze the given reaction:\n\nNH4NO3 -> N2O + 2H2O\n\nFirst, we need to find the oxidation states of nitrogen in the products:\n\nIn N2O, the oxidation state of nitrogen is +1. This is because oxygen has an oxidation state of -2, and there are two nitrogen atoms, making a total of +2. So, the oxidation state of each nitrogen in N2O is +1.\n\nIn the reaction, the nitrogen in NH4+ goes from an oxidation state of -3 to +1. This is an increase in oxidation state, which means the nitrogen in NH4+ is being oxidized.\n\nThe nitrogen in NO3- goes from an oxidation state of +5 to +1. This is a decrease in oxidation state, which means the nitrogen in NO3- is being reduced.\n\nSo, in the given reaction, the nitrogen in NH4+ is being oxidized, and the nitrogen in NO3- is being reduced."
