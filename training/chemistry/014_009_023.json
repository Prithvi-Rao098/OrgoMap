    "message_2": "The coordination geometry of the [Th(NO3)6]2- complex ion is hexagonal bipyramidal. In this complex, the central metal ion Th(IV) is surrounded by six nitrate (NO3-) ligands acting as bidentate chelating ligands. Each nitrate ligand coordinates to the Th(IV) ion through two oxygen atoms, leading to a total of 12 coordinate bonds. This arrangement forms a hexagonal bipyramidal geometry."
