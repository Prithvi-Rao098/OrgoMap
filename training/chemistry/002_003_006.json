    "message_2": "To determine the solubility of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in water at 25°C, we can use the solubility product constant (Ksp) expression. The balanced equation for the dissolution of CaCO3 is:\n\nCaCO3 (s) ⇌ Ca²⁺ (aq) + CO3²⁻ (aq)\n\nThe Ksp expression for this reaction is:\n\nKsp = [Ca²⁺][CO3²⁻]\n\nGiven that the Ksp for CaCO3 is 3.3 x 10^-9, we can set up the equation as follows:\n\n3.3 x 10^-9 = [Ca²⁺][CO3²⁻]\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, we can assume that the concentration of Ca²⁺ and CO3²⁻ are equal. Let the solubility of CaCO3 be represented by \"x.\"\n\n3.3 x 10^-9 = [x][x] = x^2\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = √(3.3 x 10^-9)\nx ≈ 1.8 x 10^-5 M\n\nSo, the solubility of calcium carbonate in water at 25°C is approximately 1.8 x 10^-5 M.\n\nWhen a common ion, such as sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), is added to the solution, the solubility of calcium carbonate will be affected by the common ion effect. Sodium carbonate dissociates in water as follows:\n\nNa2CO3 (aq) → 2Na⁺ (aq) + CO3²⁻ (aq)\n\nThe addition of sodium carbonate increases the concentration of CO3²⁻ ions in the solution. According to Le Chatelier's principle, the equilibrium will shift to counteract this change, which in this case means that the equilibrium will shift to the left, favoring the formation of solid CaCO3. As a result, the solubility of calcium carbonate will decrease in the presence of sodium carbonate."
