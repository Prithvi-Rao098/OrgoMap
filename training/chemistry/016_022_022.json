Assume that the molar enthalpy of formation of CO2 and H2O are -393.5 kJ/mol and -241.8 kJ/mol, respectively.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the isomerization of butene to isobutene, we can use Hess's Law. Hess's Law states that the enthalpy change for a reaction is the same whether it occurs in one step or several steps. In this case, we can use the enthalpy of combustion for butene and isobutene to determine the enthalpy change for the isomerization.\n\nFirst, let's write the balanced combustion reactions for butene and isobutene:\n\nButene:\nC4H8 (g) + 6 O2 (g) → 4 CO2 (g) + 4 H2O (l)  ΔH_combustion = -2671.2 kJ/mol\n\nIsobutene:\nC4H8 (g) + 6 O2 (g) → 4 CO2 (g) + 4 H2O (l)  ΔH_combustion = -2678.6 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can use Hess's Law to determine the enthalpy change for the isomerization of butene to isobutene:\n\nΔH_isomerization = ΔH_combustion (isobutene) - ΔH_combustion (butene)\n\nΔH_isomerization = (-2678.6 kJ/mol) - (-2671.2 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH_isomerization = -7.4 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change for the isomerization of butene to isobutene is -7.4 kJ/mol."
