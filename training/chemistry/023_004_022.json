    "message_2": "To determine the maximum theoretical yield of acetylsalicylic acid, we first need to find the limiting reactant. We will do this by calculating the moles of each reactant and comparing their mole ratios.\n\nThe molecular weight of salicylic acid (C7H6O3) is:\n(12.01 * 7) + (1.01 * 6) + (16.00 * 3) = 138.12 g/mol\n\nThe molecular weight of acetic anhydride (C4H6O3) is:\n(12.01 * 4) + (1.01 * 6) + (16.00 * 3) = 102.09 g/mol\n\nThe molecular weight of acetylsalicylic acid (C9H8O4) is:\n(12.01 * 9) + (1.01 * 8) + (16.00 * 4) = 180.16 g/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the moles of each reactant:\nmoles of salicylic acid = 5 g / 138.12 g/mol = 0.0362 mol\nmoles of acetic anhydride = (10 mL * 1.08 g/mL) / 102.09 g/mol = 0.106 mol (assuming the density of acetic anhydride is 1.08 g/mL)\n\nSince the reaction occurs in a 1:1 ratio, salicylic acid is the limiting reactant. Therefore, we can calculate the maximum theoretical yield of acetylsalicylic acid:\n\n0.0362 mol * 180.16 g/mol = 6.52 g\n\nThe maximum theoretical yield of acetylsalicylic acid that can be obtained from 5 grams of salicylic acid and 10 mL of acetic anhydride is 6.52 grams."
