    "message_2": "To calculate the standard free energy change (ΔG°) for the redox reaction, we need to first determine the overall cell potential (E°cell) and then use the following equation:\n\nΔG° = -nFE°cell\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of electrons transferred, F is Faraday's constant (96,485 C/mol), and E°cell is the cell potential.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the half-reactions:\n\nOxidation half-reaction: H2O2(aq) → O2(g) + 2H+(aq) + 2e-\nReduction half-reaction: Fe3+(aq) + e- → Fe2+(aq)\n\nNow, we need to balance the half-reactions to find the overall redox reaction:\n\nOxidation half-reaction (multiplied by 2): 2H2O2(aq) → 2O2(g) + 4H+(aq) + 4e-\nReduction half-reaction (multiplied by 4): 4Fe3+(aq) + 4e- → 4Fe2+(aq)\n\nAdding the two balanced half-reactions, we get:\n\n2H2O2(aq) + 4Fe3+(aq) → 2O2(g) + 4H+(aq) + 4Fe2+(aq)\n\nHowever, this is not the same as the given balanced chemical equation. To make it match, we need to multiply the oxidation half-reaction by 3 and the reduction half-reaction by 2:\n\nOxidation half-reaction (multiplied by 3): 3H2O2(aq) → 3O2(g) + 6H+(aq) + 6e-\nReduction half-reaction (multiplied by 2): 2Fe3+(aq) + 2e- → 2Fe2+(aq)\n\nNow, adding the two balanced half-reactions, we get the given balanced chemical equation:\n\n2Fe3+(aq) + 3H2O2(aq) → 2Fe2+(aq) + 3O2(g) + 6H+(aq)\n\nNow we can find the overall cell potential (E°cell) using the standard reduction potentials given:\n\nE°cell = E°cathode - E°anode\n\nSince Fe3+ is being reduced, it is the cathode, and H2O2 is the anode:\n\nE°cell = (+0.77 V) - (+0.70 V) = +0.07 V\n\nNow we can calculate the standard free energy change (ΔG°) using the equation:\n\nΔG° = -nFE°cell\n\nThe number of moles of electrons transferred (n) is 6, as seen in the balanced equation:\n\nΔG° = -(6 mol)(96,485 C/mol)(+0.07 V)\nΔG° = -40,560.9 J/mol\n\nSince it is more common to express ΔG° in kJ/mol, we can convert the value:\n\nΔG° = -40.56 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard free energy change for the given redox reaction is -40.56 kJ/mol."
