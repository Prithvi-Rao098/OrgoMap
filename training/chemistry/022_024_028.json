    "message_2": "To find the pH of the buffer solution, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n\nwhere pH is the pH of the solution, pKa is the negative logarithm of the acid dissociation constant (Ka), [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate ion, CH3COO-), and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid (acetic acid, CH3COOH).\n\nFirst, we need to find the pKa of acetic acid:\n\npKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.8 x 10^-5) = 4.74\n\nNext, we need to find the concentrations of the acetate ion and acetic acid. Since the solution is 1 liter, the concentrations are equal to the moles:\n\n[CH3COO-] = 0.15 M (from sodium acetate)\n[CH3COOH] = 0.2 M (from acetic acid)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = 4.74 + log(0.15/0.2) = 4.74 + log(0.75) = 4.74 - 0.12 = 4.62\n\nThe pH of the buffer solution is 4.62."
