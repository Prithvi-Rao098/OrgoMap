    "message_2": "First, let's write the chemical equation for the reaction between lead(II) nitrate (Pb(NO₃)₂) and potassium iodide (KI):\n\nPb(NO₃)₂ (aq) + 2 KI (aq) → PbI₂ (s) + 2 KNO₃ (aq)\n\nNow, the balanced chemical equation is:\n\nPb(NO₃)₂ (aq) + 2 KI (aq) → PbI₂ (s) + 2 KNO₃ (aq)\n\nNext, we need to determine the limiting reactant. To do this, we'll use the volume and molarity of each reactant to find the moles of each reactant.\n\nMoles of Pb(NO₃)₂ = (0.20 mol/L) * (50.0 mL) * (1 L/1000 mL) = 0.010 mol\nMoles of KI = (0.15 mol/L) * (75.0 mL) * (1 L/1000 mL) = 0.01125 mol\n\nNow, we'll use the stoichiometry of the balanced equation to determine the limiting reactant:\n\n0.010 mol Pb(NO₃)₂ * (1 mol PbI₂ / 1 mol Pb(NO₃)₂) = 0.010 mol PbI₂\n0.01125 mol KI * (1 mol PbI₂ / 2 mol KI) = 0.005625 mol PbI₂\n\nSince the amount of PbI₂ produced from KI is less than the amount produced from Pb(NO₃)₂, KI is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow, we can calculate the mass of PbI₂ formed:\n\nMoles of PbI₂ = 0.005625 mol\nMolar mass of PbI₂ = 461.01 g/mol (Pb = 207.2 g/mol, I = 126.9 g/mol)\n\nMass of PbI₂ = (0.005625 mol) * (461.01 g/mol) = 2.59 g\n\nSo, 2.59 grams of lead(II) iodide will be formed when 50.0 mL of 0.20 M lead(II) nitrate is mixed with 75.0 mL of 0.15 M potassium iodide."
