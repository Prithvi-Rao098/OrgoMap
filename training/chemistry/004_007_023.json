    "message_2": "To determine the mass of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in the marble sample, we need to first find out how much hydrochloric acid (HCl) reacted with the calcium carbonate. Then, we can use stoichiometry to find the mass of calcium carbonate.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction between calcium carbonate and hydrochloric acid is:\n\nCaCO3 (s) + 2 HCl (aq) → CaCl2 (aq) + H2O (l) + CO2 (g)\n\nLet's assume that V mL of 0.1 M HCl solution was used to react with the calcium carbonate in the marble sample, and the remaining (25 - V) mL of 0.1 M HCl solution was titrated against the 0.05 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the titration reaction between HCl and NaOH is:\n\nHCl (aq) + NaOH (aq) → NaCl (aq) + H2O (l)\n\nFrom the stoichiometry of this reaction, we know that the moles of HCl are equal to the moles of NaOH.\n\nMoles of HCl = Moles of NaOH\n(25 - V) mL × 0.1 M = V mL × 0.05 M\n\nSolving for V, we get:\n\nV = 16.67 mL\n\nNow, we know that 16.67 mL of 0.1 M HCl solution reacted with the calcium carbonate in the marble sample. To find the moles of calcium carbonate, we can use the stoichiometry of the reaction between CaCO3 and HCl:\n\nMoles of CaCO3 = (Moles of HCl) / 2\nMoles of CaCO3 = (16.67 mL × 0.1 M) / 2\n\nMoles of CaCO3 = 0.008335 mol\n\nNow, we can find the mass of calcium carbonate using its molar mass (100.09 g/mol):\n\nMass of CaCO3 = Moles of CaCO3 × Molar mass of CaCO3\nMass of CaCO3 = 0.008335 mol × 100.09 g/mol\n\nMass of CaCO3 = 0.8339 g\n\nTherefore, the mass of calcium carbonate present in the 2 grams of marble sample is approximately 0.8339 grams."
