    "message_2": "To find the polarization observed in the cell, we first need to calculate the voltage across the cell when the current is passing through it. We can use Ohm's law to do this:\n\nV = I * (R_internal + R_external)\n\nWhere V is the voltage across the cell, I is the current passing through the cell, R_internal is the internal resistance of the cell, and R_external is the resistance of the external circuit.\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nV = 0.5 A * (2 ohms + 3 ohms)\nV = 0.5 A * 5 ohms\nV = 2.5 volts\n\nNow that we have the voltage across the cell, we can find the polarization by subtracting the emf of the cell from the voltage across the cell:\n\nPolarization = V - emf\nPolarization = 2.5 volts - 2.5 volts\nPolarization = 0 volts\n\nSince the polarization is in millivolts, we can convert it:\n\nPolarization = 0 volts * 1000\nPolarization = 0 millivolts\n\nThe polarization observed in the cell is 0 millivolts."
