    "message_2": "Cis- and trans-dichloroethene molecules exhibit geometric isomerism, which is a type of stereoisomerism. Geometric isomerism occurs when two molecules have the same molecular formula and connectivity but differ in their spatial arrangement due to the presence of a double bond or a ring structure that prevents free rotation.\n\nTo determine the type of isomerism experimentally, you can use the following techniques:\n\n1. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy: Geometric isomers often have different IR spectra due to differences in their bond angles and dipole moments. By comparing the IR spectra of the two isomers, you can identify the presence of geometric isomerism.\n\n2. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy: Geometric isomers can have different chemical shifts in their NMR spectra due to the differences in their electronic environments. Comparing the NMR spectra of the two isomers can help identify the type of isomerism.\n\n3. X-ray Crystallography: This technique can be used to determine the three-dimensional structure of a molecule, which can help confirm the presence of geometric isomerism. By analyzing the crystal structure of the two isomers, you can determine their spatial arrangement and identify the type of isomerism.\n\n4. Melting Point and Boiling Point: Geometric isomers often have different physical properties, such as melting points and boiling points. By comparing these properties for the two isomers, you can get an indication of the presence of geometric isomerism.\n\n5. Polarimetry: Geometric isomers can have different optical activities, which can be measured using a polarimeter. By comparing the optical rotation of the two isomers, you can identify the type of isomerism. However, this method is only applicable if the isomers are optically active."
