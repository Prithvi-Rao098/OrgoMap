    "message_2": "In the reaction of ethanol with acidified potassium dichromate, the carbon atom in ethanol gets oxidized. Let's analyze the oxidation states of carbon in both the reactant (ethanol) and the product (acetic acid).\n\nEthanol (C2H5OH) has the following structure:\n\nCH3-CH2-OH\n\nThe carbon atom in the CH3 group has an oxidation state of -3, while the carbon atom in the CH2 group has an oxidation state of -1.\n\nWhen ethanol reacts with acidified potassium dichromate, it gets oxidized to acetic acid (CH3COOH). The structure of acetic acid is:\n\nCH3-COOH\n\nIn acetic acid, the carbon atom in the CH3 group still has an oxidation state of -3, but the carbon atom in the COOH group has an oxidation state of +3.\n\nSo, the oxidation state of the carbon atom in the reaction of ethanol with acidified potassium dichromate changes from -1 to +3. This represents an increase in the oxidation state, which indicates that the carbon atom has been oxidized."
