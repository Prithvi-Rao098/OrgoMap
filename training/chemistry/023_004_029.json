    "message_2": "To calculate the theoretical yield and actual yield, we first need to determine the limiting reactant. The balanced chemical equation for the synthesis of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is:\n\nC7H6O3 (salicylic acid) + C4H6O3 (acetic anhydride) â†’ C9H8O4 (acetylsalicylic acid) + C2H4O2 (acetic acid)\n\nMolar masses:\nSalicylic acid: 138.12 g/mol\nAcetic anhydride: 102.09 g/mol\nAcetylsalicylic acid: 180.16 g/mol\n\nFirst, convert the masses of the reactants to moles:\nmoles of salicylic acid = 3 g / 138.12 g/mol = 0.0217 mol\nmoles of acetic anhydride = 5 g / 102.09 g/mol = 0.0489 mol\n\nNow, compare the mole ratios of the reactants to determine the limiting reactant:\n0.0217 mol salicylic acid / 1 = 0.0217\n0.0489 mol acetic anhydride / 1 = 0.0489\n\nSince 0.0217 is smaller than 0.0489, salicylic acid is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow, calculate the theoretical yield of acetylsalicylic acid:\n0.0217 mol salicylic acid * (1 mol acetylsalicylic acid / 1 mol salicylic acid) * 180.16 g/mol = 3.91 g\n\nFinally, calculate the actual yield based on the 95% yield:\nActual yield = 0.95 * 3.91 g = 3.71 g\n\nSo, the theoretical yield of acetylsalicylic acid is 3.91 g, and the actual yield is 3.71 g."
