    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction, we can use the formula:\n\nKc = [NH3]^2 / ([N2] * [H2]^3)\n\nAt equilibrium, the concentrations are given as:\n\n[N2] = 0.12 M\n[H2] = 0.20 M\n[NH3] = 0.16 M\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nKc = (0.16)^2 / (0.12 * (0.20)^3)\n\nKc = 0.0256 / (0.12 * 0.008)\n\nKc = 0.0256 / 0.00096\n\nKc ≈ 26.67\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction at 300 K is approximately 26.67."
