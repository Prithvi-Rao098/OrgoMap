    "message_2": "To find the percent abundance of carbon-14 in a sample of carbon-containing material, we need to compare the amount of carbon-14 to the total amount of carbon in the sample. Carbon-14 is a rare isotope, and the majority of carbon in a sample is carbon-12. \n\nFirst, let's find the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 using the decay rate constant (λ) and the half-life (t1/2) of carbon-14.\n\nThe relationship between the decay rate constant and half-life is given by the equation:\n\nt1/2 = ln(2) / λ\n\nwhere ln(2) is the natural logarithm of 2 (approximately 0.693).\n\nGiven the half-life of carbon-14 (t1/2) is 5,700 years and the decay rate constant (λ) is 1.21 x 10^-4 per year, we can find the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 at the time of the sample's formation:\n\n5700 = 0.693 / λ\nλ = 0.693 / 5700\nλ ≈ 1.21 x 10^-4 per year (as given)\n\nNow, we can use the decay rate constant to find the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 in the sample. The ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 in the atmosphere is approximately constant over time, and it is approximately:\n\nC-14 / C-12 ≈ 1.3 x 10^-12\n\nSince the decay rate constant is given, we can assume that the sample is in equilibrium with the atmosphere. Therefore, the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 in the sample is also:\n\nC-14 / C-12 ≈ 1.3 x 10^-12\n\nTo find the percent abundance of carbon-14 in the sample, we need to consider the total amount of carbon, which is the sum of carbon-14 and carbon-12:\n\nTotal carbon = C-14 + C-12\n\nSince the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 is very small, the total amount of carbon is approximately equal to the amount of carbon-12:\n\nTotal carbon ≈ C-12\n\nNow, we can find the percent abundance of carbon-14 in the sample:\n\nPercent abundance of C-14 = (C-14 / Total carbon) x 100%\n≈ (C-14 / C-12) x 100%\n≈ (1.3 x 10^-12) x 100%\n≈ 1.3 x 10^-10 %\n\nTherefore, the percent abundance of carbon-14 in the sample of carbon-containing material is approximately 1.3 x 10^-10%."
