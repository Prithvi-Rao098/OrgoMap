    "message_1": "Sure, here's a potential task for the student:\n\nA chemical reaction in a closed system is at equilibrium. Initially, the system contains 0.20 mol of reactant A and 0.30 mol of reactant B. A catalyst is added to the system, and the reaction proceeds until a new equilibrium is established. The equilibrium constant, Kc, for the reaction is 2.5 x 10^-3. Calculate the new equilibrium concentrations of reactants A and B, assuming the catalyst has no effect on the overall stoichiometry of the reaction.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the initial concentrations of reactants A and B as [A]₀ and [B]₀, respectively. Since we are given the initial moles of A and B, we need the volume of the system to calculate the initial concentrations. Let's assume the volume of the system is V.\n\n[A]₀ = 0.20 mol / V\n[B]₀ = 0.30 mol / V\n\nNow, let's denote the change in the concentration of A and B as x. At equilibrium, the concentration of A will be [A]₀ - x, and the concentration of B will be [B]₀ - x.\n\n[A] = (0.20 - x) mol / V\n[B] = (0.30 - x) mol / V\n\nThe equilibrium constant Kc is given as 2.5 x 10^-3. Assuming the reaction is A + B ⇌ C, the expression for Kc is:\n\nKc = [C] / ([A][B])\n\nSince the catalyst does not affect the stoichiometry of the reaction, the change in the concentration of C will also be x. Therefore, at equilibrium:\n\n[C] = x mol / V\n\nNow, we can substitute the equilibrium concentrations of A, B, and C into the Kc expression:\n\n2.5 x 10^-3 = (x) / ((0.20 - x)(0.30 - x))\n\nTo solve for x, we can first simplify the denominator:\n\n(0.20 - x)(0.30 - x) = 0.06 - 0.50x + x^2\n\nNow, substitute the simplified denominator back into the Kc expression:\n\n2.5 x 10^-3 = x / (0.06 - 0.50x + x^2)\n\nTo solve for x, we can multiply both sides by the denominator and rearrange the equation into a quadratic form:\n\nx^3 - 0.50x^2 + 0.06x - 2.5 x 10^-3 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve the cubic equation for x using numerical methods or software. Once we have the value of x, we can calculate the new equilibrium concentrations of A and B:\n\n[A] = (0.20 - x) mol / V\n[B] = (0.30 - x) mol / V"
