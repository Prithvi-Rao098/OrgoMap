    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of stoichiometry. First, we need to find the molar mass of each compound involved in the reaction.\n\nMolar mass of CH4 (methane) = 12.01 g/mol (C) + 4 * 1.01 g/mol (H) = 16.05 g/mol\nMolar mass of O2 (oxygen) = 2 * 16.00 g/mol = 32.00 g/mol\nMolar mass of CO2 (carbon dioxide) = 12.01 g/mol (C) + 2 * 16.00 g/mol (O) = 44.01 g/mol\nMolar mass of H2O (water) = 2 * 1.01 g/mol (H) + 16.00 g/mol (O) = 18.02 g/mol\n\nNow, we will convert the given mass of methane (5.00 grams) to moles using its molar mass:\n\nmoles of CH4 = mass of CH4 / molar mass of CH4\nmoles of CH4 = 5.00 g / 16.05 g/mol = 0.3115 mol\n\nAccording to the balanced equation, 1 mole of CH4 produces 2 moles of H2O. So, we can find the moles of H2O produced:\n\nmoles of H2O = 2 * moles of CH4\nmoles of H2O = 2 * 0.3115 mol = 0.6230 mol\n\nFinally, we will convert the moles of H2O back to grams using its molar mass:\n\nmass of H2O = moles of H2O * molar mass of H2O\nmass of H2O = 0.6230 mol * 18.02 g/mol = 11.22 g\n\nSo, 11.22 grams of water is produced when 5.00 grams of methane undergoes complete combustion."
