    "message_2": "The coordination geometry of the complex [Cu(NH3)4]SO4 is square planar. In this complex, the central metal ion (Cu2+) is surrounded by four ammonia (NH3) ligands, which are arranged at the corners of a square plane.\n\nTo determine the nature of the ligand-metal coordination bond and its bonding energy, we can use UV-Vis spectroscopy. This technique measures the absorption of light by a compound as a function of wavelength. The absorption of light is related to the electronic transitions within the molecule, which can provide information about the nature of the bonding.\n\nIn the case of [Cu(NH3)4]SO4, the complex absorbs light in the visible region, which is responsible for its characteristic blue color. The absorption band in the visible region is due to the d-d transition of the Cu2+ ion. This transition involves the promotion of an electron from a lower energy d-orbital to a higher energy d-orbital.\n\nThe nature of the ligand-metal coordination bond in this complex can be described as a dative covalent bond, where the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom of the ammonia ligand is donated to the empty d-orbitals of the Cu2+ ion. This type of bond is also known as a coordinate covalent bond.\n\nTo determine the bonding energy, we can use the wavelength of maximum absorption (λmax) from the UV-Vis spectrum. The bonding energy (E) can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nE = h * c / λmax\n\nwhere h is Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s), and λmax is the wavelength of maximum absorption in meters.\n\nOnce the bonding energy is calculated, it can provide information about the strength of the ligand-metal coordination bond in the complex."
