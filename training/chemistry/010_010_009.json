    "message_1": "What is the power output of a galvanic cell if the electromotive force (EMF) is 1.50 V and the cell current is 0.200 A? The cell consists of a zinc electrode in a solution of zinc sulfate and a copper electrode in a solution of copper sulfate. The zinc electrode is the anode and the copper electrode is the cathode. The standard reduction potentials for Zn2+ and Cu2+ are -0.763 V and 0.337 V, respectively.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the power output of the galvanic cell, we can use the formula:\n\nPower (P) = Voltage (V) × Current (I)\n\nGiven the electromotive force (EMF) is 1.50 V and the cell current is 0.200 A, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP = 1.50 V × 0.200 A\n\nP = 0.300 W\n\nThe power output of the galvanic cell is 0.300 watts."
