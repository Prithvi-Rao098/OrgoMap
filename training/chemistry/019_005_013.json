    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG = Σ ΔG(products) - Σ ΔG(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔG(products) is the sum of the standard Gibbs free energy of formation for the products and ΔG(reactants) is the sum of the standard Gibbs free energy of formation for the reactants.\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\n2CH4(g) + 3O2(g) → 2CO2(g) + 2H2O(g)\n\nΔG(products) = [2 × (-394.4 kJ/mol)] + [2 × (-241.8 kJ/mol)] = -788.8 kJ/mol - 483.6 kJ/mol = -1272.4 kJ/mol\n\nΔG(reactants) = [2 × (-50.8 kJ/mol)] + [3 × (0 kJ/mol)] = -101.6 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate ΔG for the reaction:\n\nΔG = Σ ΔG(products) - Σ ΔG(reactants) = -1272.4 kJ/mol - (-101.6 kJ/mol) = -1170.8 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the Gibbs free energy change for the reaction at 298 K is -1170.8 kJ/mol."
