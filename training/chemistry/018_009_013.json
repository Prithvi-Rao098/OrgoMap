    "message_2": "The reaction between sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a well-known reaction in chemistry, which produces a colloidal solution of sulfur (S) as one of the products. The reaction can be represented by the following equation:\n\nNa2S2O3 (aq) + 2 HCl (aq) â†’ 2 NaCl (aq) + H2O (l) + SO2 (g) + S (s)\n\nThe rate of this reaction is typically studied by monitoring the formation of the sulfur precipitate, which causes the solution to become cloudy. This reaction is often used to demonstrate the concept of reaction rates and the effect of various factors on them.\n\nHowever, the reaction between sodium thiosulfate and hydrochloric acid is not a photochemical reaction, meaning that it is not directly influenced by light. Therefore, changing the light intensity should not have a significant effect on the rate of the reaction. \n\nIt is important to note that temperature, concentration, and the presence of catalysts can affect the rate of this reaction, but light intensity should not play a significant role in the reaction rate."
