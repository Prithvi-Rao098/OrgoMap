    "message_2": "To calculate the molar heat capacity of carbon dioxide gas at constant volume (Cv), we can use the formula:\n\nq = n * Cv * ΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat energy added (in Joules), n is the number of moles, and ΔT is the change in temperature (in Kelvin).\n\nWe are given the following information:\n\n- Initial temperature (T1) = 298 K\n- Final temperature (T2) = 398 K\n- Heat energy added (q) = 2.00 Joules\n- Number of moles (n) = 1.00 mole\n\nFirst, let's calculate the change in temperature (ΔT):\n\nΔT = T2 - T1 = 398 K - 298 K = 100 K\n\nNow, we can rearrange the formula to solve for Cv:\n\nCv = q / (n * ΔT)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nCv = 2.00 J / (1.00 mol * 100 K) = 0.02 J/(mol*K)\n\nSo, the molar heat capacity of carbon dioxide gas at constant volume is 0.02 J/(mol*K)."
