    "message_2": "To determine the maximum theoretical yield of aspirin, we need to know the amount of salicylic acid and acetic anhydride used in the reaction. Since you didn't provide the amounts, I will assume you want a general formula to calculate the yield.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the synthesis of aspirin is:\n\nC7H6O3 (salicylic acid) + C4H6O3 (acetic anhydride) → C9H8O4 (aspirin) + C2H4O2 (acetic acid)\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of salicylic acid reacts with 1 mole of acetic anhydride to produce 1 mole of aspirin.\n\nTo calculate the maximum theoretical yield of aspirin, use the following formula:\n\nTheoretical yield (g) = (moles of salicylic acid) × (molar mass of aspirin)\n\nFirst, determine the moles of salicylic acid used in the reaction. This can be calculated using the mass of salicylic acid and its molar mass:\n\nMoles of salicylic acid = (mass of salicylic acid in grams) / (molar mass of salicylic acid)\n\nThe molar mass of salicylic acid (C7H6O3) is approximately 138.12 g/mol, and the molar mass of aspirin (C9H8O4) is approximately 180.16 g/mol.\n\nNow, plug the moles of salicylic acid into the formula for theoretical yield:\n\nTheoretical yield (g) = (moles of salicylic acid) × (180.16 g/mol)\n\nThis formula will give you the maximum theoretical yield of aspirin in grams, assuming a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio between reactants and complete conversion of salicylic acid."
