    "message_2": "To calculate the bond order and predict the stability of a nitrogen molecule (N2) using molecular orbital theory, we need to consider the electronic configuration of nitrogen and the molecular orbitals formed when two nitrogen atoms bond.\n\nNitrogen has an atomic number of 7, which means it has 7 electrons. The electronic configuration of nitrogen is 1s²2s²2p³. In a nitrogen molecule (N2), there are two nitrogen atoms, so there are a total of 14 electrons.\n\nMolecular orbital theory describes the formation of molecular orbitals when atomic orbitals combine. For N2, the molecular orbitals are formed as follows:\n\n1. Two 1s orbitals combine to form one sigma(1s) bonding orbital and one sigma*(1s) antibonding orbital.\n2. Two 2s orbitals combine to form one sigma(2s) bonding orbital and one sigma*(2s) antibonding orbital.\n3. Two 2p orbitals combine to form one sigma(2p) bonding orbital, two pi(2p) bonding orbitals, one sigma*(2p) antibonding orbital, and two pi*(2p) antibonding orbitals.\n\nNow, we need to fill these molecular orbitals with the 14 electrons in N2. The order of filling is:\n\n1. sigma(1s) - 2 electrons\n2. sigma*(1s) - 2 electrons\n3. sigma(2s) - 2 electrons\n4. sigma*(2s) - 2 electrons\n5. sigma(2p) - 2 electrons\n6. pi(2p) - 4 electrons (2 electrons in each of the two degenerate pi orbitals)\n\nAll 14 electrons have been placed in the molecular orbitals. To calculate the bond order, we use the formula:\n\nBond order = (number of electrons in bonding orbitals - number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\n\nBond order = (10 - 4) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3\n\nThe bond order of N2 is 3, which indicates a triple bond between the two nitrogen atoms. A higher bond order generally correlates with greater stability, so we can predict that the nitrogen molecule (N2) is quite stable. This is consistent with the fact that N2 is a major component of Earth's atmosphere and is relatively unreactive under normal conditions."
