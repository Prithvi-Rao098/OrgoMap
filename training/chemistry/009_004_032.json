    "message_1": "What is the mass defect of a helium nucleus produced during a fusion reaction between two deuterium nuclei? Given the masses of deuterium and helium nuclei as 2.014 amu and 4.003 amu, respectively. Assume that the mass of two protons and two neutrons in the helium nucleus is 4.0026 amu. Show your calculations.",
    "message_2": "To find the mass defect of a helium nucleus produced during a fusion reaction between two deuterium nuclei, we need to calculate the difference between the initial mass of the reactants (two deuterium nuclei) and the final mass of the product (helium nucleus).\n\nInitial mass of reactants (two deuterium nuclei) = 2 × mass of one deuterium nucleus\n= 2 × 2.014 amu\n= 4.028 amu\n\nFinal mass of product (helium nucleus) = 4.003 amu\n\nMass defect = Initial mass - Final mass\n= 4.028 amu - 4.003 amu\n= 0.025 amu\n\nTherefore, the mass defect of a helium nucleus produced during a fusion reaction between two deuterium nuclei is 0.025 amu."
