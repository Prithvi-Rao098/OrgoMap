    "message_1": "What is the enthalpy of formation of magnesium oxide (MgO) given the enthalpy of formation of magnesium (Mg) is -601 kJ/mol and the enthalpy of formation of oxygen (O2) is 0 kJ/mol?",
    "message_2": "The enthalpy of formation of magnesium oxide (MgO) cannot be determined using the given information. The enthalpies of formation provided are for magnesium (Mg) and oxygen (O2), which are the reactants in the formation of magnesium oxide. To find the enthalpy of formation of MgO, you would need the enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nMg (s) + 1/2 O2 (g) â†’ MgO (s)\n\nThis enthalpy change, also known as the heat of formation, is specific to the formation of one mole of magnesium oxide from its constituent elements in their standard states. If this value is provided, then you can determine the enthalpy of formation of MgO."
