    "message_1": "What is the standard enthalpy change for the sublimation of carbon dioxide (CO₂) at 298 K and 1 atm pressure, given the following information: \n\nStandard enthalpy of formation of solid carbon dioxide (s) = -393.5 kJ/mol \nStandard enthalpy of formation of gaseous carbon dioxide (g) = -393.5 kJ/mol \nStandard entropy change of sublimation of carbon dioxide (ΔsubHo) = 24.4 J/molK",
    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy change for the sublimation of carbon dioxide (CO₂) at 298 K and 1 atm pressure, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH_sub = ΔH_f(g) - ΔH_f(s)\n\nGiven that the standard enthalpy of formation of solid carbon dioxide (s) and gaseous carbon dioxide (g) are both -393.5 kJ/mol, the equation becomes:\n\nΔH_sub = -393.5 kJ/mol - (-393.5 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH_sub = 0 kJ/mol\n\nHowever, this result seems counterintuitive, as we would expect a non-zero value for the enthalpy change of sublimation. The given information appears to be incorrect or incomplete. The standard entropy change of sublimation (ΔsubHo) is not directly useful for calculating the enthalpy change of sublimation in this case."
