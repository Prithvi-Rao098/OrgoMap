    "message_1": "Calculate the standard enthalpy change ($\\Delta H^\\circ$) for the dissolution of 10.0 g of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in 100.0 mL of water assuming that the specific heat capacity of the solution is 4.18 J g$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ and that the initial and final temperatures are 25.0$^\\circ$C and 35.0$^\\circ$C, respectively. The molar mass of NaOH is 40.0 g mol$^{-1}$.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the dissolution of NaOH, we first need to determine the heat absorbed by the solution (q) using the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere m is the mass of the solution, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nFirst, we need to find the mass of the solution. Since the mass of NaOH is 10.0 g and the volume of water is 100.0 mL, we can assume that the mass of water is approximately 100.0 g (since the density of water is approximately 1 g/mL). Therefore, the mass of the solution is:\n\nm_solution = m_NaOH + m_water = 10.0 g + 100.0 g = 110.0 g\n\nNext, we can calculate the change in temperature:\n\nΔT = T_final - T_initial = 35.0°C - 25.0°C = 10.0°C\n\nNow we can calculate the heat absorbed by the solution:\n\nq = mcΔT = (110.0 g)(4.18 J g$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$)(10.0°C) = 4596 J\n\nNow we need to find the moles of NaOH:\n\nmoles_NaOH = mass_NaOH / molar_mass_NaOH = 10.0 g / 40.0 g mol$^{-1}$ = 0.25 mol\n\nFinally, we can calculate the standard enthalpy change for the dissolution of NaOH:\n\nΔH° = q / moles_NaOH = 4596 J / 0.25 mol = 18384 J/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the dissolution of NaOH is 18,384 J/mol."
