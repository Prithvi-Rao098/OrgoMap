    "message_2": "To find the rate of reaction, we first need to determine the number of moles of magnesium and hydrochloric acid, and then use the stoichiometry of the reaction to find the moles of hydrogen gas produced. Finally, we can use the ideal gas law to determine the time it took for the reaction to occur and then calculate the rate.\n\n1. Determine the moles of magnesium:\nMagnesium (Mg) has a molar mass of 24.31 g/mol.\n1.5 g Mg × (1 mol Mg / 24.31 g Mg) = 0.0617 mol Mg\n\n2. Determine the moles of hydrochloric acid:\n25 mL of 2 M HCl solution contains:\n25 mL × (1 L / 1000 mL) × 2 mol/L = 0.05 mol HCl\n\n3. Write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\nMg (s) + 2 HCl (aq) → MgCl₂ (aq) + H₂ (g)\n\n4. Determine the limiting reactant:\nSince 1 mol of Mg reacts with 2 mol of HCl, the stoichiometric ratio is 1:2. \n0.0617 mol Mg × 2 = 0.1234 mol HCl required\n\nSince we only have 0.05 mol HCl, HCl is the limiting reactant.\n\n5. Determine the moles of hydrogen gas produced:\nFrom the stoichiometry of the reaction, 1 mol of Mg reacts with 2 mol of HCl to produce 1 mol of H₂.\n0.05 mol HCl × (1 mol H₂ / 2 mol HCl) = 0.025 mol H₂\n\n6. Use the ideal gas law to find the time of the reaction:\nPV = nRT\nWhere P = pressure (1 atm), V = volume (0.25 L), n = moles of H₂ (0.025 mol), R = gas constant (0.0821 L atm / K mol), and T = temperature (25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K).\n\n1 atm × 0.25 L = 0.025 mol × 0.0821 L atm / K mol × 298.15 K\nt = 0.25 L / (0.025 mol × 0.0821 L atm / K mol × 298.15 K)\nt ≈ 40.4 seconds\n\n7. Calculate the rate of reaction:\nRate = moles of H₂ produced / time\nRate = 0.025 mol / 40.4 s\nRate ≈ 0.000619 mol/s\n\nThe rate of reaction is approximately 0.000619 mol/s."
