    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the isomerization of butene-1 to butene-2, we can use Hess's Law. According to Hess's Law, the enthalpy change for a reaction is the same whether it occurs in one step or several steps. In this case, we can consider the combustion of butene-1 and butene-2 as two separate steps.\n\nStep 1: Combustion of butene-1\nButene-1 + O2 → Combustion products\nΔH1 = -2657.7 kJ/mol\n\nStep 2: Combustion of butene-2\nButene-2 + O2 → Combustion products\nΔH2 = -2674.4 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can use these two steps to calculate the enthalpy change for the isomerization of butene-1 to butene-2:\n\nStep 3: Isomerization of butene-1 to butene-2\nButene-1 → Butene-2\nΔH3 = ?\n\nAccording to Hess's Law, the sum of the enthalpy changes for steps 1 and 2 should be equal to the enthalpy change for step 3:\n\nΔH1 + ΔH2 = ΔH3\n\nSince we want to find the enthalpy change for the isomerization of butene-1 to butene-2 (ΔH3), we can rearrange the equation:\n\nΔH3 = ΔH2 - ΔH1\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for ΔH1 and ΔH2:\n\nΔH3 = (-2674.4 kJ/mol) - (-2657.7 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH3 = -16.7 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the isomerization of butene-1 to butene-2 is -16.7 kJ/mol."
