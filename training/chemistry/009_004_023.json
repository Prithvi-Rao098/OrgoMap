    "message_2": "To calculate the energy released during the fusion of deuterium (²H) and tritium (³H) to produce helium-4 (⁴He), we can use the following equation:\n\nE = Δm * c²\n\nwhere E is the energy released, Δm is the mass difference between the reactants and products, and c is the speed of light (3.0 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to determine the mass difference (Δm) between the reactants and products. The atomic masses of deuterium, tritium, and helium-4 are approximately:\n\n²H: 2.014 amu\n³H: 3.016 amu\n⁴He: 4.002 amu\n\n1 gram of deuterium contains 1/2.014 = 0.4965 moles of deuterium.\n3 grams of tritium contains 3/3.016 = 0.9954 moles of tritium.\n\nSince the fusion reaction is:\n\n²H + ³H → ⁴He + n\n\nThe limiting reactant is deuterium, as there are fewer moles of it. Therefore, 0.4965 moles of deuterium will react with 0.4965 moles of tritium to produce 0.4965 moles of helium-4.\n\nThe mass of the reactants is:\n0.4965 moles * 2.014 amu/mole (deuterium) + 0.4965 moles * 3.016 amu/mole (tritium) = 2.478 amu\n\nThe mass of the products is:\n0.4965 moles * 4.002 amu/mole (helium-4) = 1.986 amu\n\nThe mass difference (Δm) is:\n2.478 amu - 1.986 amu = 0.492 amu\n\nTo convert the mass difference from atomic mass units (amu) to kilograms (kg), we can use the conversion factor 1 amu = 1.66054 x 10^-27 kg:\n\n0.492 amu * 1.66054 x 10^-27 kg/amu = 8.171 x 10^-28 kg\n\nNow we can calculate the energy released (E) using the equation E = Δm * c²:\n\nE = (8.171 x 10^-28 kg) * (3.0 x 10^8 m/s)² = 7.354 x 10^-11 Joules\n\nSo, the energy released during the fusion of 1 gram of deuterium and 3 grams of tritium to produce helium-4 is approximately 7.354 x 10^-11 Joules."
