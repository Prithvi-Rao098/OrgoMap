    "message_2": "The standard potential of the Zn/Zn²⁺ electrode with respect to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) is the same as the reduction potential of Zn²⁺, which is -0.761 V. This is because the standard hydrogen electrode has a potential of 0 V by definition, so the potential difference between the Zn/Zn²⁺ electrode and the SHE is simply the reduction potential of Zn²⁺."
