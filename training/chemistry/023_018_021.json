    "message_2": "To calculate the mass of 2,4-dinitrophenol that can be obtained from 5 grams of phenol, we need to use stoichiometry. First, we need to find the balanced chemical equation for the synthesis of 2,4-dinitrophenol from phenol and nitric acid.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation is:\n\nC6H5OH (phenol) + 2 HNO3 (nitric acid) → C6H3N2O5 (2,4-dinitrophenol) + 2 H2O (water)\n\nNow, we need to find the molar masses of phenol and 2,4-dinitrophenol.\n\nPhenol (C6H5OH): (6 × 12.01) + (5 × 1.01) + 16.00 = 94.11 g/mol\n2,4-Dinitrophenol (C6H3N2O5): (6 × 12.01) + (3 × 1.01) + (2 × 14.01) + (5 × 16.00) = 184.11 g/mol\n\nNext, we need to convert the mass of phenol (5 grams) into moles:\n\nmoles of phenol = mass of phenol / molar mass of phenol\nmoles of phenol = 5 g / 94.11 g/mol = 0.0531 mol\n\nAccording to the balanced chemical equation, 1 mole of phenol reacts to produce 1 mole of 2,4-dinitrophenol. Therefore, the moles of 2,4-dinitrophenol produced will be the same as the moles of phenol used:\n\nmoles of 2,4-dinitrophenol = 0.0531 mol\n\nNow, we can convert the moles of 2,4-dinitrophenol into mass:\n\nmass of 2,4-dinitrophenol = moles of 2,4-dinitrophenol × molar mass of 2,4-dinitrophenol\nmass of 2,4-dinitrophenol = 0.0531 mol × 184.11 g/mol = 9.77 g\n\nTherefore, the mass of 2,4-dinitrophenol that can be obtained from 5 grams of phenol and excess nitric acid is approximately 9.77 grams."
