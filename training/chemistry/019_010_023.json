    "message_2": "The standard enthalpy change for the combustion reaction of one mole of methane gas (CH4) at standard temperature and pressure is approximately -890 kJ/mol. This value represents the amount of heat released when one mole of methane is completely combusted in excess oxygen under standard conditions."
