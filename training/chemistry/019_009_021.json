    "message_2": "To calculate the standard free energy change (ΔG°) for the redox reaction, we first need to determine the standard cell potential (E°cell) for the reaction. We can do this using the given standard reduction potentials (E°) for the half-reactions:\n\nE°(Fe3+|Fe2+) = +0.77 V\nE°(Cl2|Cl-) = +1.36 V\n\nSince Fe2+ is being oxidized to Fe3+ and Cl2 is being reduced to Cl-, the overall cell potential is:\n\nE°cell = E°(reduction) - E°(oxidation)\nE°cell = E°(Cl2|Cl-) - E°(Fe3+|Fe2+)\nE°cell = (+1.36 V) - (+0.77 V)\nE°cell = +0.59 V\n\nNow that we have the standard cell potential, we can calculate the standard free energy change (ΔG°) using the following equation:\n\nΔG° = -nFE°cell\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the reaction, F is Faraday's constant (96,485 C/mol), and E°cell is the standard cell potential.\n\nIn this reaction, 2 moles of electrons are transferred (from 2Fe2+ to 2Fe3+), so n = 2. Therefore:\n\nΔG° = -(2 mol)(96,485 C/mol)(+0.59 V)\nΔG° = -113,851.9 J/mol\n\nSince the standard free energy change is typically expressed in kJ/mol, we can convert it:\n\nΔG° = -113.85 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard free energy change (ΔG°) for the given redox reaction at 298 K is -113.85 kJ/mol."
