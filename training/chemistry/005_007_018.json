    "message_2": "To determine the amino acid sequence of a specific protein given the DNA sequence of the corresponding gene, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Transcription: Convert the DNA sequence into an mRNA sequence.\n2. Translation: Convert the mRNA sequence into an amino acid sequence using the genetic code.\n\nStep 1: Transcription\nDuring transcription, the DNA sequence is used as a template to create a complementary mRNA sequence. The DNA bases adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T) pair with their corresponding mRNA bases: uracil (U), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and adenine (A), respectively.\n\nFor example, if the DNA sequence is:\n5'-ATGCGTACCTGA-3'\n\nThe corresponding mRNA sequence would be:\n5'-AUGCGUACCUGA-3'\n\nStep 2: Translation\nDuring translation, the mRNA sequence is read in groups of three nucleotides called codons. Each codon corresponds to a specific amino acid or a stop signal. The genetic code is used to determine which amino acid each codon represents.\n\nUsing the mRNA sequence from Step 1:\n5'-AUGCGUACCUGA-3'\n\nThe codons are:\nAUG - Methionine (Met)\nCGU - Arginine (Arg)\nACC - Threonine (Thr)\nUGA - Stop\n\nThe amino acid sequence of the protein is:\nMet-Arg-Thr\n\nSo, the amino acid sequence of the specific protein given the DNA sequence of the corresponding gene is Methionine-Arginine-Threonine."
