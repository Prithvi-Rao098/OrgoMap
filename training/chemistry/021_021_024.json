    "message_2": "The hybridization of carbon atoms in ethene (C2H4) is sp2. In ethene, each carbon atom forms three sigma bonds: one with another carbon atom and two with hydrogen atoms. To accommodate these three sigma bonds, the carbon atoms use three hybrid orbitals formed by mixing one s orbital and two p orbitals, resulting in sp2 hybridization."
