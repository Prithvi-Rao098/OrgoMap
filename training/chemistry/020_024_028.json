    "message_1": "What is the effect of adding a catalyst on the equilibrium position of the redox reaction: Fe3+(aq) + SCN-(aq) ⇌ FeSCN2+(aq)? Calculate the equilibrium constants (Kc and Kp) at 25°C for the reaction with and without a catalyst. Also, explain why addition of a catalyst changes the position of the equilibrium in this system.",
    "message_2": "Adding a catalyst to a reaction does not change the equilibrium position of the reaction. A catalyst works by lowering the activation energy of the reaction, which increases the rate at which the reaction reaches equilibrium. However, the equilibrium constant (Kc or Kp) remains the same, as it is only dependent on the temperature and not on the presence of a catalyst.\n\nIn the case of the redox reaction: Fe3+(aq) + SCN-(aq) ⇌ FeSCN2+(aq), the equilibrium constants Kc and Kp will remain the same with or without a catalyst at 25°C. To calculate the equilibrium constants, we would need the equilibrium concentrations of the reactants and products, which are not provided in the problem statement.\n\nIn summary, the addition of a catalyst does not change the position of the equilibrium or the equilibrium constants (Kc and Kp) in the system. It only affects the rate at which the reaction reaches equilibrium."
