    "message_2": "The type of bond formed between two hydrogen atoms is a covalent bond, specifically a single covalent bond. This is because both hydrogen atoms share a pair of electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration.\n\nThe type of bond formed between a hydrogen atom and a chlorine atom is also a covalent bond, specifically a polar covalent bond. This is because the electrons are shared between the two atoms, but the electronegativity difference between hydrogen and chlorine causes the shared electrons to be more attracted to the chlorine atom, creating a polar bond with a partial positive charge on the hydrogen atom and a partial negative charge on the chlorine atom."
