The reaction equation is: \nCaCO3(s) + 2HCl(aq) → CaCl2(aq) + CO2(g) + H2O(l) \nAssume that the pressure in the flask remains constant and that the reaction follows first-order kinetics.",
    "message_2": "To find the rate of reaction, we first need to determine the amount of CO2 produced in moles. We can use the ideal gas law equation to do this:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nWhere P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is temperature in Kelvin.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the temperature to Kelvin:\nT = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\n\nAssuming the pressure in the flask remains constant, we can use atmospheric pressure (1 atm) for our calculations. The volume of CO2 produced is 300 ml, which we need to convert to liters:\n\nV = 300 ml * (1 L / 1000 ml) = 0.3 L\n\nNow we can plug in the values into the ideal gas law equation:\n\n(1 atm) * (0.3 L) = n * (0.0821 L atm / K mol) * (298.15 K)\n\nSolving for n:\n\nn = (1 atm * 0.3 L) / (0.0821 L atm / K mol * 298.15 K) = 0.0122 mol\n\nNow that we have the moles of CO2 produced, we can find the rate of reaction. The reaction takes 20 minutes, which we need to convert to seconds:\n\ntime = 20 min * (60 s / 1 min) = 1200 s\n\nSince the reaction follows first-order kinetics, the rate of reaction can be calculated as:\n\nrate = moles of CO2 / time\n\nrate = 0.0122 mol / 1200 s = 1.02 x 10^-5 mol/s\n\nThe rate of reaction between hydrochloric acid and marble chips in these conditions is approximately 1.02 x 10^-5 mol/s."
