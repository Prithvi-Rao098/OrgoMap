    "message_2": "The electrophilic addition of HBr to propene in the presence of a peroxide catalyst follows a different mechanism than the standard electrophilic addition. This reaction is known as the free radical addition or anti-Markovnikov addition of HBr to propene. The presence of a peroxide catalyst leads to the formation of a bromine radical, which then reacts with propene to form the final product. The mechanism can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n1. Initiation:\nThe peroxide catalyst (ROOR') undergoes homolytic cleavage, usually induced by heat or light, to form two alkoxy radicals (RO• and R'O•). These radicals are highly reactive and can initiate the reaction.\n\nROOR' → RO• + R'O•\n\nOne of the alkoxy radicals reacts with HBr, breaking the H-Br bond homolytically and generating a bromine radical (Br•) and an alcohol (ROH).\n\nRO• + HBr → ROH + Br•\n\n2. Propagation:\nThe bromine radical (Br•) reacts with propene (CH2=CH-CH3) in a free radical addition, forming a secondary free radical at the allylic position (CH2-CH•-CH3).\n\nBr• + CH2=CH-CH3 → CH2-CH(Br)-CH3•\n\nThe secondary free radical reacts with another molecule of HBr, breaking the H-Br bond homolytically and generating a new bromine radical (Br•) and the final product, 1-bromopropane (CH3-CH(Br)-CH3).\n\nCH2-CH•-CH3 + HBr → CH3-CH(Br)-CH3 + Br•\n\n3. Termination:\nThe reaction can be terminated by the combination of two free radicals, such as two bromine radicals or a bromine radical and an alkoxy radical, to form a stable molecule.\n\nBr• + Br• → Br2\nBr• + RO• → R-O-Br\n\nThe overall reaction is as follows:\n\nCH2=CH-CH3 + HBr → CH3-CH(Br)-CH3\n\nIn the presence of a peroxide catalyst, the electrophilic addition of HBr to propene follows the anti-Markovnikov rule, where the bromine atom is added to the less substituted carbon of the double bond, resulting in the formation of 1-bromopropane."
