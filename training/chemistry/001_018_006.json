    "message_2": "To find the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid, we can use the formula for the acid dissociation constant (Ka) and the definition of pH. The Ka expression for acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is:\n\nKa = [CH₃COO⁻][H₃O⁺] / [CH₃COOH]\n\nSince the initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.1 M, we can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the equilibrium concentrations of the species involved in the reaction:\n\n          CH₃COOH  ⇌  CH₃COO⁻ + H₃O⁺\nInitial:   0.1 M         0 M         0 M\nChange:   -x M         +x M        +x M\nEquilibrium: 0.1-x M      x M         x M\n\nNow, we can substitute these equilibrium concentrations into the Ka expression:\n\n1.8 x 10⁻⁵ = (x)(x) / (0.1 - x)\n\nTo simplify the equation, we can make the assumption that x is very small compared to 0.1, so (0.1 - x) ≈ 0.1:\n\n1.8 x 10⁻⁵ ≈ x² / 0.1\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx² ≈ 1.8 x 10⁻⁵ * 0.1\nx² ≈ 1.8 x 10⁻⁶\nx ≈ √(1.8 x 10⁻⁶)\nx ≈ 1.34 x 10⁻³\n\nSince x represents the concentration of H₃O⁺ ions, we can now find the pH using the definition of pH:\n\npH = -log[H₃O⁺]\npH = -log(1.34 x 10⁻³)\npH ≈ 2.87\n\nTherefore, the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid at 25°C is approximately 2.87."
