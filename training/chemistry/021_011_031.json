    "message_2": "The bond dissociation energy is the energy required to break a bond between two atoms. In this case, we are given the average H-H bond energy, which is 436 kJ/mol. Since there is only one H-H bond in a hydrogen molecule (H2), the bond dissociation energy is equal to the average bond energy.\n\nHere are the steps to calculate the bond dissociation energy for the H-H bond:\n\n1. Identify the bond: In this case, it's the H-H bond in a hydrogen molecule (H2).\n\n2. Find the average bond energy: We are given that the average H-H bond energy is 436 kJ/mol.\n\n3. Calculate the bond dissociation energy: Since there is only one H-H bond in the hydrogen molecule, the bond dissociation energy is equal to the average bond energy.\n\nBond dissociation energy (H-H) = Average bond energy (H-H)\nBond dissociation energy (H-H) = 436 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the bond dissociation energy for the H-H bond is 436 kJ/mol."
