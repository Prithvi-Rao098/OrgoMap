    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the phase transition reaction, we can use Hess's Law, which states that the total enthalpy change for a reaction is the sum of the enthalpy changes for the individual steps.\n\nThe reaction we are considering is:\n\nNH4NO3(s) → NH3(g) + NO2(g)\n\nWe are given the standard enthalpies of formation for each substance:\n\nNH4NO3(s): -365.5 kJ/mol\nNH3(g): -46.1 kJ/mol\nNO2(g): 33.2 kJ/mol\n\nUsing Hess's Law, the standard enthalpy change for the reaction (ΔH) can be calculated as follows:\n\nΔH = [ΔHf(NH3) + ΔHf(NO2)] - ΔHf(NH4NO3)\n\nΔH = [(-46.1 kJ/mol) + (33.2 kJ/mol)] - (-365.5 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH = (-12.9 kJ/mol) + 365.5 kJ/mol\n\nΔH = 352.6 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change for the phase transition reaction of solid ammonium nitrate to gaseous NH3 and NO2 is 352.6 kJ/mol."
