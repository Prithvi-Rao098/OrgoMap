    "message_2": "The preparation of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine from hydrazine and 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene involves a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction. Here is the step-by-step reaction mechanism:\n\n1. Nucleophilic attack: The nitrogen atom of the hydrazine (N2H4) molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon atom of the 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene that is bonded to the chlorine atom. This step forms a new carbon-nitrogen bond.\n\n2. Formation of a resonance-stabilized intermediate: The electrons from the carbon-chlorine bond move to the chlorine atom, which then forms a negatively charged intermediate. This intermediate is resonance-stabilized due to the delocalization of the negative charge on the chlorine atom and the aromatic ring.\n\n3. Proton transfer: A proton from the hydrazine molecule is transferred to the negatively charged chlorine atom, forming a hydrochloric acid (HCl) molecule as a byproduct.\n\n4. Rearomatization: The negatively charged intermediate regains its aromaticity by transferring the negative charge back to the carbon atom, breaking the carbon-chlorine bond, and releasing the chloride ion.\n\n5. Protonation of the nitrogen atom: The nitrogen atom in the newly formed 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine molecule is protonated by another hydrazine molecule or a solvent molecule, completing the formation of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine.\n\nOverall, the reaction can be represented as:\n\nN2H4 + C6H3Cl(NO2)2 â†’ C6H3N2H(NO2)2 + HCl"
