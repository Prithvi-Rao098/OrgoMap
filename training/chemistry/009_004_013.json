    "message_2": "To calculate the energy produced in this reaction, we first need to determine the number of moles of deuterium and tritium involved. \n\nDeuterium has a molar mass of approximately 2 grams/mole, and tritium has a molar mass of approximately 3 grams/mole.\n\nNumber of moles of deuterium = mass / molar mass = 2 g / 2 g/mol = 1 mole\nNumber of moles of tritium = mass / molar mass = 3 g / 3 g/mol = 1 mole\n\nThe nuclear fusion reaction between deuterium and tritium can be represented as:\n\nD + T -> He-4 + n\n\nwhere D is deuterium, T is tritium, He-4 is helium-4, and n is a neutron.\n\nThe energy released in this reaction is approximately 17.6 MeV (million electron volts) per reaction.\n\nSince we have 1 mole of deuterium and 1 mole of tritium, the limiting reactant is 1 mole. Therefore, we have 1 mole of reactions occurring.\n\n1 mole of reactions = 6.022 x 10^23 reactions (Avogadro's number)\n\nTotal energy released = (6.022 x 10^23 reactions) * (17.6 MeV/reaction)\n\nTo convert MeV to Joules, we use the conversion factor: 1 MeV = 1.602 x 10^-13 Joules\n\nTotal energy released = (6.022 x 10^23 reactions) * (17.6 MeV/reaction) * (1.602 x 10^-13 J/MeV)\n\nTotal energy released â‰ˆ 1.69 x 10^12 Joules\n\nSo, the energy produced when 2 grams of deuterium undergoes a nuclear fusion reaction with 3 grams of tritium, assuming 100% fusion efficiency, is approximately 1.69 x 10^12 Joules."
