    "message_2": "The major difference between DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid) lies in their structure, which in turn influences their functions in managing genetic information. Both DNA and RNA are nucleic acids composed of nucleotide monomers, but they have distinct structural features that account for their different roles in cells.\n\n1. Sugar component: The sugar component in the nucleotide building blocks of DNA and RNA is different. DNA contains deoxyribose sugar, while RNA contains ribose sugar. The difference lies in the presence of a hydroxyl group (-OH) at the 2' carbon in ribose, whereas deoxyribose has a hydrogen atom (H) at the same position. This difference makes RNA more reactive and less stable compared to DNA.\n\n2. Nitrogenous bases: Both DNA and RNA have four nitrogenous bases each, but the bases differ between the two molecules. DNA contains adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T), while RNA contains adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and uracil (U) instead of thymine. The presence of uracil in RNA instead of thymine further contributes to its lower stability compared to DNA.\n\n3. Structure: DNA is typically double-stranded, forming a double helix structure with two complementary strands running in opposite directions (antiparallel). The nitrogenous bases in each strand pair up through hydrogen bonds, with adenine pairing with thymine and guanine pairing with cytosine. This double-stranded structure allows DNA to store genetic information more stably and protect it from damage. In contrast, RNA is usually single-stranded, which allows it to fold into various secondary and tertiary structures necessary for its diverse functions.\n\n4. Function: DNA primarily serves as the genetic material in cells, storing the information required for the synthesis of proteins and other cellular components. It is responsible for the long-term storage and transmission of genetic information from one generation to another. RNA, on the other hand, has multiple roles in the expression of genetic information. It acts as a template for protein synthesis (messenger RNA or mRNA), as a structural and catalytic component of the ribosome (ribosomal RNA or rRNA), and as a molecule involved in the processing and regulation of gene expression (transfer RNA or tRNA, and other non-coding RNAs).\n\nIn summary, the major difference between DNA and RNA lies in their structural features, including the sugar component, nitrogenous bases, and overall structure. These differences account for their distinct functions in managing genetic information, with DNA serving as the stable storage and transmission of genetic information, and RNA playing diverse roles in the expression and regulation of this information."
