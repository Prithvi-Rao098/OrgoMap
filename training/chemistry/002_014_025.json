    "message_2": "To calculate the formal charge on the nitrogen atom in the compound NO₃⁻ (nitrate ion), we will use the formula:\n\nFormal charge = (Valence electrons of the atom) - (Non-bonding electrons) - 0.5 * (Bonding electrons)\n\nFirst, let's determine the number of valence electrons, non-bonding electrons, and bonding electrons for the nitrogen atom in NO₃⁻.\n\n1. Valence electrons: Nitrogen belongs to Group 15 (or Group 5A) in the periodic table, so it has 5 valence electrons.\n\n2. Non-bonding electrons: In the nitrate ion, nitrogen is bonded to three oxygen atoms, and there are no lone pairs of electrons on the nitrogen atom. Therefore, there are 0 non-bonding electrons.\n\n3. Bonding electrons: Nitrogen forms one double bond with an oxygen atom and two single bonds with the other two oxygen atoms. A double bond consists of 4 electrons (2 pairs), and a single bond consists of 2 electrons (1 pair). So, there are a total of 4 (from the double bond) + 2 (from the first single bond) + 2 (from the second single bond) = 8 bonding electrons.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nFormal charge = (5) - (0) - 0.5 * (8)\nFormal charge = 5 - 0 - 4\nFormal charge = 1\n\nHowever, we must consider that the nitrate ion has a -1 overall charge. This means that the formal charge on the nitrogen atom should be adjusted by -1:\n\nFormal charge = 1 - 1\nFormal charge = 0\n\nSo, the formal charge on the nitrogen atom in the compound NO₃⁻ is 0."
