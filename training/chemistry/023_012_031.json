    "message_2": "The synthesis of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) involves two main steps: nitration of toluene to form dinitrotoluene (DNT) and further nitration of DNT to form TNT. In both steps, a mixture of nitric acid and sulfuric acid is used as the nitrating agent.\n\n1. Nitration of toluene to form dinitrotoluene (DNT):\nC6H5CH3 + 2HNO3 -> C6H3(CH3)(NO2)2 + 2H2O\n\n2. Nitration of dinitrotoluene to form 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT):\nC6H3(CH3)(NO2)2 + HNO3 -> C6H2(CH3)(NO2)3 + H2O\n\nFrom the balanced equations, we can see that the overall stoichiometry for the synthesis of TNT is:\n\nC6H5CH3 + 3HNO3 -> C6H2(CH3)(NO2)3 + 3H2O\n\nThus, the optimal molar ratio of toluene to nitric acid for the maximum yield of TNT is 1:3."
