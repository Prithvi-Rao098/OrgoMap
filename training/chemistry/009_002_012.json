    "message_2": "The decay series of thorium-232, also known as the thorium series or 4n decay series, is a chain of nuclear decays that ultimately leads to the stable isotope lead-208. The decay series involves several alpha (α) and beta (β) decays. Here is the decay series of thorium-232 and the products produced at each stage:\n\n1. Thorium-232 (Th-232) undergoes alpha decay with a half-life of 14.05 billion years, producing:\n   Product: Radium-228 (Ra-228)\n\n2. Radium-228 (Ra-228) undergoes beta decay with a half-life of 5.75 years, producing:\n   Product: Actinium-228 (Ac-228)\n\n3. Actinium-228 (Ac-228) undergoes beta decay with a half-life of 6.15 hours, producing:\n   Product: Thorium-228 (Th-228)\n\n4. Thorium-228 (Th-228) undergoes alpha decay with a half-life of 1.91 years, producing:\n   Product: Radium-224 (Ra-224)\n\n5. Radium-224 (Ra-224) undergoes alpha decay with a half-life of 3.63 days, producing:\n   Product: Radon-220 (Rn-220)\n\n6. Radon-220 (Rn-220) undergoes alpha decay with a half-life of 55.6 seconds, producing:\n   Product: Polonium-216 (Po-216)\n\n7. Polonium-216 (Po-216) undergoes alpha decay with a half-life of 0.145 seconds, producing:\n   Product: Lead-212 (Pb-212)\n\n8. Lead-212 (Pb-212) undergoes beta decay with a half-life of 10.64 hours, producing:\n   Product: Bismuth-212 (Bi-212)\n\n9. Bismuth-212 (Bi-212) undergoes alpha decay with a half-life of 60.6 minutes (35.6% probability) or beta decay with a half-life of 60.6 minutes (64.4% probability), producing:\n   Product (alpha decay, 35.6%): Thallium-208 (Tl-208)\n   Product (beta decay, 64.4%): Polonium-212 (Po-212)\n\n10. Thallium-208 (Tl-208) undergoes beta decay with a half-life of 3.05 minutes, producing:\n    Product: Lead-208 (Pb-208) - stable isotope\n\n11. Polonium-212 (Po-212) undergoes alpha decay with a half-life of 299 nanoseconds, producing:\n    Product: Lead-208 (Pb-208) - stable isotope\n\nThe final stable product of the thorium-232 decay series is lead-208 (Pb-208)."
