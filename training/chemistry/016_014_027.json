    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat absorbed or released, we need to determine the number of moles of dry ice and then use the heat of sublimation.\n\nFirst, we need to find the molar mass of carbon dioxide (CO2). The atomic mass of carbon (C) is 12.01 g/mol, and the atomic mass of oxygen (O) is 16.00 g/mol. Therefore, the molar mass of CO2 is:\n\nMolar mass of CO2 = 12.01 g/mol (C) + 2 * 16.00 g/mol (O) = 44.01 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the number of moles of dry ice (n) using the mass (m) and molar mass (M):\n\nn = m / M\nn = 20 g / 44.01 g/mol = 0.454 mol\n\nNow we can use the heat of sublimation (ΔH_sub) to calculate the amount of heat absorbed or released (q):\n\nq = n * ΔH_sub\nq = 0.454 mol * 25.2 kJ/mol = 11.44 kJ\n\nSince the dry ice is being converted from solid to gas, it is absorbing heat. Therefore, the amount of heat absorbed is 11.44 kJ."
