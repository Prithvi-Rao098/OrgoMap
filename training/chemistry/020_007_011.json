    "message_2": "The effect of increasing pressure on the equilibrium position of the exothermic reaction N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g) can be analyzed using Le Chatelier's principle. According to Le Chatelier's principle, if a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in pressure, temperature, or concentration of reactants or products, the system will adjust its equilibrium position to counteract the change.\n\nIn this case, the pressure of the system is increased. The reaction has 4 moles of gas on the reactant side (1 mole of N2 and 3 moles of H2) and 2 moles of gas on the product side (2 moles of NH3). When the pressure is increased, the system will shift its equilibrium position to the side with fewer moles of gas to counteract the pressure increase. Therefore, the equilibrium will shift to the right, favoring the formation of NH3.\n\nTo calculate the new equilibrium concentration of NH3, we need more information such as the initial concentrations of the reactants and products, and the equilibrium constant (Kp) for the reaction. However, we can qualitatively say that the concentration of NH3 will increase as the equilibrium shifts to the right due to the increased pressure."
