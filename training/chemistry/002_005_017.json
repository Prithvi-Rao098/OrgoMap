    "message_2": "The inorganic compound formed between Calcium (Ca) and Chlorine (Cl) is Calcium Chloride (CaCl2). \n\nTo identify it as ionic, covalent, or metallic, we can look at the elements involved and their properties. Calcium is an alkaline earth metal from Group 2 of the periodic table, while Chlorine is a halogen from Group 17. \n\nIn general, when a metal reacts with a non-metal, they form an ionic compound. Metals tend to lose electrons and form positively charged ions (cations), while non-metals tend to gain electrons and form negatively charged ions (anions). In the case of Calcium Chloride, Calcium loses two electrons to form a Ca2+ ion, and each Chlorine atom gains one electron to form a Cl- ion. The electrostatic attraction between these oppositely charged ions results in the formation of an ionic compound.\n\nTherefore, Calcium Chloride (CaCl2) is an ionic compound."
