    "message_1": "A copper wire is exposed to a solution containing 0.2 M NaCl. The corrosion rate of the wire is found to be 5.8 microAmp/cm². Calculate the corrosion current density of the copper wire in the given environment.",
    "message_2": "The corrosion rate of the copper wire is given as 5.8 microAmp/cm². This value is already the corrosion current density. \n\nCorrosion current density (i_corr) is the measure of the rate of corrosion in terms of current per unit area. It is usually expressed in microAmp/cm² or mA/cm². In this case, the corrosion current density of the copper wire in the given environment is 5.8 microAmp/cm²."
