    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change of combustion for methane, we can use Hess's Law equation. According to Hess's Law, the overall enthalpy change of a reaction is equal to the sum of the enthalpy changes of the individual steps in the reaction.\n\nFor the given balanced chemical equation:\n\nCH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(l)\n\nWe can break this down into two steps:\n\n1. Formation of CO2(g) from CH4(g) and O2(g):\nCH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(l)\n\n2. Formation of 2H2O(l) from CH4(g) and O2(g):\nCH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(l)\n\nNow, we can use the standard enthalpy change of formation values given for CO2 and H2O:\n\nΔHf°(CO2) = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(H2O) = -286 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change of combustion for methane (ΔHc°) can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nΔHc° = [ΔHf°(CO2) + 2 * ΔHf°(H2O)] - [ΔHf°(CH4) + 2 * ΔHf°(O2)]\n\nSince the standard enthalpy change of formation for elements in their standard state is zero, ΔHf°(CH4) and ΔHf°(O2) are both 0:\n\nΔHc° = [-393.5 + 2 * (-286)] - [0 + 2 * 0]\n\nΔHc° = -393.5 - 572\n\nΔHc° = -965.5 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change of combustion for methane is -965.5 kJ/mol."
