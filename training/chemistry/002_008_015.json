    "message_2": "To find the percent composition of magnesium chloride (MgCl2), we need to determine the molar mass of each element in the compound and then calculate the percentage of each element's mass relative to the total molar mass of the compound.\n\n1. Determine the molar mass of each element in the compound:\n- Magnesium (Mg): 24.305 g/mol\n- Chlorine (Cl): 35.453 g/mol\n\n2. Calculate the molar mass of magnesium chloride (MgCl2):\nMgCl2 = 1 Mg + 2 Cl\nMgCl2 = (1 x 24.305 g/mol) + (2 x 35.453 g/mol)\nMgCl2 = 24.305 g/mol + 70.906 g/mol\nMgCl2 = 95.211 g/mol\n\n3. Calculate the percent composition of each element in the compound:\n- Magnesium (Mg):\n  %Mg = (mass of Mg / total mass of MgCl2) x 100\n  %Mg = (24.305 g/mol / 95.211 g/mol) x 100\n  %Mg ≈ 25.53%\n\n- Chlorine (Cl):\n  %Cl = (mass of Cl / total mass of MgCl2) x 100\n  %Cl = (70.906 g/mol / 95.211 g/mol) x 100\n  %Cl ≈ 74.47%\n\nThe percent composition of magnesium chloride (MgCl2) is approximately 25.53% magnesium (Mg) and 74.47% chlorine (Cl)."
