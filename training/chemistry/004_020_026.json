    "message_2": "As a chemist, I would need more information about compound X and its UV-Vis spectroscopy data to determine the specific functional group present in the compound. UV-Vis spectroscopy measures the absorption of light by a compound, and different functional groups absorb light at different wavelengths. If you can provide the wavelength at which the compound absorbs light or any other relevant information about the compound, I can help you identify the functional group."
