    "message_2": "To determine the precise surface area of an activated carbon sample X using nitrogen gas adsorption at 77 K, you need to perform a series of experiments and calculations. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you:\n\n1. Prepare the activated carbon sample X: Dry the sample in an oven at 110Â°C for a few hours to remove any moisture. Then, cool it down in a desiccator to room temperature.\n\n2. Perform the nitrogen gas adsorption experiment: Use a gas adsorption instrument, such as the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analyzer, to measure the nitrogen gas adsorption isotherm at 77 K. The instrument will provide you with a plot of the amount of nitrogen gas adsorbed (in moles) versus the relative pressure (P/P0).\n\n3. Analyze the data: Use the BET equation to calculate the specific surface area of the activated carbon sample X. The BET equation is:\n\nN = (N_m * C * (P/P0)) / [(1 - (P/P0)) * (1 + (C - 1) * (P/P0))]\n\nwhere N is the amount of nitrogen gas adsorbed (in moles), N_m is the monolayer capacity (in moles), C is the BET constant, and P/P0 is the relative pressure.\n\n4. Linearize the BET equation: Rearrange the BET equation to obtain a linear form:\n\n1 / [(N * (1 - P/P0))] = (1 / N_m) + (C - 1) * (P/P0) / N_m\n\n5. Plot the linearized data: Plot the experimental data points (1 / [(N * (1 - P/P0))]) versus (P/P0) and fit a straight line through the data points.\n\n6. Determine the BET parameters: From the slope and intercept of the linear fit, calculate the monolayer capacity (N_m) and the BET constant (C).\n\n7. Calculate the specific surface area: Use the following equation to calculate the specific surface area (A) of the activated carbon sample X:\n\nA = (N_m * N_A * A_N2) / M\n\nwhere N_A is Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23 mol^-1), A_N2 is the cross-sectional area of a nitrogen molecule (0.162 nm^2), and M is the mass of the activated carbon sample (in grams).\n\nAfter performing these steps, you will have the precise surface area of the activated carbon sample X determined by gas adsorption using nitrogen as the adsorbate at 77 K."
