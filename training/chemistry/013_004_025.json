    "message_1": "What is the surface area of a sample of activated carbon if it adsorbs 2.5 mL of nitrogen gas at -196°C under a pressure of 1.01325 × 10^5 Pa and the mass of the activated carbon used is 0.75 g? (Assume that the BET theory is applicable for multilayer adsorption on the activated carbon.)",
    "message_2": "To determine the surface area of the activated carbon sample, we can use the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory. The BET theory is based on the adsorption of gas molecules onto a solid surface, forming multiple layers of adsorbed gas. In this case, we are given the volume of nitrogen gas adsorbed, the temperature, and the pressure.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the volume of nitrogen gas adsorbed (2.5 mL) to moles. To do this, we will use the ideal gas law:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nWhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nGiven:\nP = 1.01325 × 10^5 Pa\nV = 2.5 mL = 0.0025 L (converted to liters)\nR = 8.314 J/(mol·K) (ideal gas constant)\nT = -196°C = 77.15 K (converted to Kelvin)\n\nRearranging the ideal gas law to solve for n:\n\nn = PV / RT\n\nn = (1.01325 × 10^5 Pa)(0.0025 L) / (8.314 J/(mol·K)(77.15 K))\n\nn ≈ 8.1 × 10^-6 mol\n\nNow that we have the moles of nitrogen gas adsorbed, we can use the BET equation to determine the surface area of the activated carbon sample:\n\nSA = (n * N_A * A_m) / m\n\nWhere SA is the surface area, n is the moles of nitrogen gas adsorbed, N_A is Avogadro's number (6.022 × 10^23 mol^-1), A_m is the cross-sectional area of a nitrogen molecule (0.162 nm²), and m is the mass of the activated carbon sample (0.75 g).\n\nSA = (8.1 × 10^-6 mol)(6.022 × 10^23 mol^-1)(0.162 nm²) / 0.75 g\n\nSA ≈ 1.08 × 10^3 m²/g\n\nFinally, to find the total surface area of the activated carbon sample, multiply the surface area per gram by the mass of the sample:\n\nTotal SA = (1.08 × 10^3 m²/g)(0.75 g)\n\nTotal SA ≈ 810 m²\n\nThe surface area of the activated carbon sample is approximately 810 m²."
