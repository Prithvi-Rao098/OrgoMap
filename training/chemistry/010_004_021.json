    "message_1": "Calculate the cell potential for the following galvanic cell where a nickel anode is placed in a 1.0M Ni(NO3)2 solution and a silver cathode is placed in a 1.0M AgNO3 solution. The balanced equation for the cell reaction is: \n\nNi(s) + 2 Ag+(aq) → Ni2+(aq) +2 Ag(s) \n\nAssume that standard reduction potentials for each half-reaction are as follows: \n\nNi2+(aq) + 2 e- ⇌ Ni(s)   E° = -0.25V \nAg+(aq) + e- ⇌ Ag(s)   E° = +0.80V \n\nWhat is the cell potential at standard conditions (25°C and 1 atm)?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the cell potential at standard conditions, we can use the Nernst equation. However, since the concentrations of the solutions are both 1.0 M, the equation simplifies to:\n\nE_cell = E°_cathode - E°_anode\n\nIn this case, the nickel anode has a standard reduction potential of -0.25 V, and the silver cathode has a standard reduction potential of +0.80 V. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\nE_cell = (+0.80 V) - (-0.25 V) = 0.80 V + 0.25 V = 1.05 V\n\nSo, the cell potential at standard conditions (25°C and 1 atm) for this galvanic cell is 1.05 V."
