    "message_1": "How much silver (Ag) is deposited on the cathode when a current of 2.5 A is passed through a solution of silver nitrate (AgNO3) for 60 minutes? The mass of AgNO3 used is 10 g and the molar mass of Ag is 107.87 g/mol. (Assume 100% current efficiency and reaction completeness.)",
    "message_2": "To determine the amount of silver deposited on the cathode, we can use Faraday's law of electrolysis. \n\nFirst, we need to find the total charge (Q) passed through the solution. \n\nQ = current (I) × time (t)\nQ = 2.5 A × (60 min × 60 s/min) = 2.5 A × 3600 s = 9000 C (Coulombs)\n\nNext, we need to find the number of moles of electrons (n) transferred during the reaction. The reaction for the reduction of silver ions is:\n\nAg+ + e- → Ag\n\nThis means that 1 mole of electrons is required to deposit 1 mole of silver.\n\nNow, we can use Faraday's constant (F = 96485 C/mol) to find the number of moles of electrons transferred:\n\nn = Q / F\nn = 9000 C / 96485 C/mol ≈ 0.0933 mol\n\nSince 1 mole of electrons deposits 1 mole of silver, 0.0933 moles of electrons will deposit 0.0933 moles of silver.\n\nFinally, we can convert moles of silver to grams using the molar mass of silver (107.87 g/mol):\n\nmass of Ag = moles of Ag × molar mass of Ag\nmass of Ag = 0.0933 mol × 107.87 g/mol ≈ 10.06 g\n\nTherefore, approximately 10.06 g of silver is deposited on the cathode."
