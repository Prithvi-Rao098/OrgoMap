    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of 1 mole of methane, we need to use the balanced equation for the combustion reaction and the standard enthalpies of formation for all the reactants and products.\n\nThe balanced equation for the combustion of methane is:\n\nCH₄(g) + 2O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l)\n\nNow, we need the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) for all the reactants and products:\n\nΔHf° [CH₄(g)] = -74.8 kJ/mol\nΔHf° [O₂(g)] = 0 kJ/mol (since O₂ is in its standard state)\nΔHf° [CO₂(g)] = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔHf° [H₂O(l)] = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nUsing Hess's Law, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction (ΔHrxn) as follows:\n\nΔHrxn = Σ [ΔHf°(products)] - Σ [ΔHf°(reactants)]\n\nΔHrxn = [1 × (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 × (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [1 × (-74.8 kJ/mol) + 2 × 0 kJ/mol]\n\nΔHrxn = (-393.5 - 571.6) - (-74.8)\n\nΔHrxn = -965.1 + 74.8\n\nΔHrxn = -890.3 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the enthalpy change for the combustion of 1 mole of methane at constant pressure is -890.3 kJ/mol."
