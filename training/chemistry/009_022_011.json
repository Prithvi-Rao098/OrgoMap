    "message_2": "As a chemist, I can provide some general information about radiation therapy, but determining the maximum dose of radiation for a specific type of cancer treatment is a task for a radiation oncologist or medical physicist.\n\nIn radiation therapy, the dose of radiation is typically measured in units called Gray (Gy). The maximum dose of radiation that can be delivered to a patient in a single fraction depends on various factors, including the type of cancer, the location of the tumor, the patient's overall health, and the potential risk to nearby healthy tissues and organs.\n\nTo determine the appropriate dose for a specific cancer treatment, radiation oncologists and medical physicists use a process called treatment planning. This involves analyzing medical images of the patient's tumor and surrounding tissues, as well as considering the patient's medical history and other relevant factors. They then use specialized software to calculate the optimal dose distribution that will maximize the radiation dose to the tumor while minimizing the dose to nearby healthy tissues and organs.\n\nIn general, the maximum dose of radiation that can be delivered in a single fraction is limited by the tolerance of the surrounding healthy tissues and organs. For example, in external beam radiation therapy, the dose per fraction typically ranges from 1.8 to 2.0 Gy for conventional fractionation, while in stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), the dose per fraction can be much higher, ranging from 5 to 20 Gy or more.\n\nHowever, it is essential to consult with a radiation oncologist or medical physicist to determine the appropriate maximum dose for a specific cancer treatment, as they have the expertise and knowledge to make these decisions based on the individual patient's needs and circumstances."
