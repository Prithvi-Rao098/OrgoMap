    "message_2": "In the compound SO2 (sulfur dioxide), the oxidation state of each element is as follows:\n\n1. Sulfur (S): +4\n2. Oxygen (O): -2\n\nHere's the explanation:\n\nOxygen generally has an oxidation state of -2. Since there are two oxygen atoms in SO2, the total oxidation state for oxygen is -4. To balance the overall charge of the compound, sulfur must have an oxidation state of +4."
