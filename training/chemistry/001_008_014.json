    "message_2": "When 3-methylbutan-2-ol reacts with PCl5 in the presence of anhydrous AlCl3, the hydroxyl group (-OH) in the alcohol is replaced by a chlorine atom, resulting in the formation of 3-methylbutan-2-chloride.\n\nThe balanced equation for the reaction is:\n\nC5H11OH + PCl5 â†’ C5H11Cl + POCl3 + HCl\n\nThe type of reaction is a nucleophilic substitution reaction, specifically, it is an S_N2 reaction where the hydroxyl group is replaced by a chlorine atom."
