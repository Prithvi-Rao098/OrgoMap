    "message_1": "What functional groups are present in the given compound as shown in its infrared spectrum?",
    "message_2": "Unfortunately, I cannot see the infrared spectrum you are referring to. However, I can provide you with some general information about identifying functional groups using infrared (IR) spectroscopy.\n\nInfrared spectroscopy is a technique used to identify functional groups in a compound based on the absorption of infrared light at specific wavelengths. The absorption of infrared light causes molecular vibrations, and different functional groups have characteristic absorption bands.\n\nHere are some common functional groups and their characteristic IR absorption bands:\n\n1. Hydroxyl group (OH): Broad absorption around 3200-3600 cm-1.\n2. Carboxylic acid (COOH): Broad absorption around 2500-3300 cm-1 (OH) and a sharp peak around 1700-1725 cm-1 (C=O).\n3. Amine (NH2 or NH): Broad absorption around 3300-3500 cm-1.\n4. Aldehyde (CHO): Sharp peak around 2700-2800 cm-1 (C-H) and a strong peak around 1700-1725 cm-1 (C=O).\n5. Ketone (C=O): Strong peak around 1700-1725 cm-1.\n6. Ester (COOR): Strong peak around 1735-1750 cm-1 (C=O).\n7. Amide (CONH2): Strong peak around 1630-1690 cm-1 (C=O) and a broad peak around 3100-3500 cm-1 (N-H).\n8. Aromatic ring (C=C): Multiple peaks around 1600-1650 cm-1 and 1450-1600 cm-1.\n9. Alkene (C=C): Peak around 1650-1680 cm-1.\n10. Nitrile (Câ‰¡N): Peak around 2220-2260 cm-1.\n\nPlease provide the specific absorption bands you observe in the IR spectrum, and I can help you identify the functional groups present in the compound."
