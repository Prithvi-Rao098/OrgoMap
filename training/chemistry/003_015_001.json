    "message_2": "The surface area of a catalyst plays a significant role in affecting the rate of a catalytic reaction. A catalyst works by providing an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy, which allows the reaction to proceed more quickly. The reaction occurs on the surface of the catalyst, where reactant molecules adsorb, form intermediates, and then desorb as product molecules.\n\nThe rate of a catalytic reaction depends on the number of active sites available on the catalyst surface, where the reactant molecules can interact with the catalyst. When the surface area of the catalyst is increased, the number of active sites also increases. This leads to a higher probability of reactant molecules encountering an active site and participating in the reaction, which in turn increases the rate of the reaction.\n\nIn summary, a larger surface area of a catalyst provides more active sites for reactant molecules to interact with, leading to an increased rate of the catalytic reaction. This is why catalysts are often used in the form of powders, pellets, or porous materials, as these forms provide a larger surface area for the reaction to occur."
