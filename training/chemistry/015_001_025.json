    "message_2": "Methane (CH4) is a tetrahedral molecule with a carbon atom at the center and four hydrogen atoms surrounding it. The electronic structure of methane can be determined by examining the atomic orbitals of the carbon and hydrogen atoms and how they combine to form molecular orbitals.\n\nCarbon has an electron configuration of 1s²2s²2p². In its ground state, carbon has two unpaired electrons in its 2p orbitals. However, in methane, carbon forms four sigma (σ) bonds with four hydrogen atoms. To achieve this, carbon undergoes hybridization, where one of the 2s electrons is promoted to the empty 2p orbital, resulting in four sp³ hybrid orbitals.\n\nEach hydrogen atom has one electron in its 1s orbital. When the four hydrogen atoms bond with the carbon atom, their 1s orbitals overlap with the carbon's sp³ hybrid orbitals, forming four σ bonds.\n\nThe molecular orbitals involved in the formation of methane are:\n\n1. Four sp³ hybrid orbitals from the carbon atom, which are formed by the combination of one 2s and three 2p orbitals.\n2. Four 1s orbitals from the four hydrogen atoms.\n\nWhen these orbitals overlap, they form four σ bonds between the carbon and hydrogen atoms, resulting in the tetrahedral structure of methane. Quantum mechanical calculations, such as those performed using the Hartree-Fock method or density functional theory (DFT), can provide more detailed information about the energies and shapes of these molecular orbitals."
