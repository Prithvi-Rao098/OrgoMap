    "message_2": "To find the pH of the resulting solution, we first need to determine the amount of moles of HCl and NaOH in the solution and then find the moles of H+ ions remaining after the reaction.\n\n1. Calculate the moles of HCl and NaOH:\nmoles of HCl = volume (L) × concentration (M)\nmoles of HCl = 0.025 L × 0.1 M = 0.0025 moles\n\nmoles of NaOH = volume (L) × concentration (M)\nmoles of NaOH = 0.035 L × 0.05 M = 0.00175 moles\n\n2. Determine the moles of H+ ions remaining after the reaction:\nSince HCl and NaOH react in a 1:1 ratio, we can subtract the moles of NaOH from the moles of HCl to find the moles of H+ ions remaining.\nmoles of H+ ions remaining = moles of HCl - moles of NaOH\nmoles of H+ ions remaining = 0.0025 - 0.00175 = 0.00075 moles\n\n3. Calculate the concentration of H+ ions in the final solution:\nThe total volume of the solution is 25 mL + 35 mL = 60 mL or 0.060 L.\nconcentration of H+ ions = moles of H+ ions / total volume (L)\nconcentration of H+ ions = 0.00075 moles / 0.060 L = 0.0125 M\n\n4. Calculate the pH of the solution:\npH = -log10(concentration of H+ ions)\npH = -log10(0.0125) ≈ 1.90\n\nThe pH of the solution obtained by mixing 25 mL of 0.1 M HCl with 35 mL of 0.05 M NaOH is approximately 1.90."
