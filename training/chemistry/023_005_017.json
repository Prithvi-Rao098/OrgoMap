    "message_2": "The synthesis of ibuprofen from 2-methylpropylbenzene (also known as isobutylbenzene) involves a series of reactions. Here is the step-by-step mechanism:\n\n1. Friedel-Crafts Alkylation: The first step is the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of isobutylbenzene with propionyl chloride in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, such as aluminum chloride (AlCl3). This reaction forms 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanoyl chloride.\n\n2. Hydrolysis: The next step is the hydrolysis of the acyl chloride formed in the previous step. This can be done by treating the compound with water or a weak base like sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to form 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanoic acid, which is the ibuprofen precursor.\n\n3. Carboxylation: The third step is the carboxylation of the ibuprofen precursor using carbon dioxide (CO2). This can be achieved by heating the precursor in the presence of a strong base like sodium hydroxide (NaOH) under high pressure and temperature. This reaction forms the sodium salt of ibuprofen.\n\n4. Acidification: The final step is the acidification of the sodium salt of ibuprofen. This can be done by treating the salt with a strong acid like hydrochloric acid (HCl) to form the final product, ibuprofen.\n\nTo optimize the reaction and increase the yield of ibuprofen, the following strategies can be employed:\n\n1. Use of excess reactants: Using an excess of propionyl chloride and isobutylbenzene in the Friedel-Crafts alkylation step can help drive the reaction to completion and increase the yield of the product.\n\n2. Temperature and pressure control: Maintaining optimal temperature and pressure conditions during the carboxylation step can help increase the yield of the sodium salt of ibuprofen. Typically, a temperature of 130-150Â°C and a pressure of 10-15 atm are used.\n\n3. Purification: Purifying the intermediate products at each step can help remove impurities and side products, which can improve the overall yield of the final product.\n\n4. Catalyst optimization: Using an appropriate catalyst and optimizing its concentration can help improve the efficiency of the reactions and increase the yield of ibuprofen. For example, using a more effective Lewis acid catalyst in the Friedel-Crafts alkylation step can help improve the reaction rate and yield.\n\n5. Reaction monitoring: Monitoring the progress of each reaction step using analytical techniques like thin-layer chromatography (TLC) or high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) can help determine the optimal reaction time and conditions for each step, which can improve the overall yield of ibuprofen."
