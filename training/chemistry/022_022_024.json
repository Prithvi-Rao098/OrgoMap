According to Le Chatelier's principle, how would increasing the pressure of the system affect the yield of ammonia gas? Provide a scientific explanation for your answer.",
    "message_2": "According to Le Chatelier's principle, if a change is applied to a system at equilibrium, the system will adjust itself to counteract the change and restore a new equilibrium. In the case of the reaction between nitrogen gas (N₂) and hydrogen gas (H₂) to form ammonia gas (NH₃), the balanced chemical equation is:\n\nN₂(g) + 3H₂(g) ⇌ 2NH₃(g)\n\nWhen the pressure of the system is increased, the equilibrium will shift to counteract this change. In this case, the equilibrium will shift towards the side with fewer moles of gas, as this will help to reduce the pressure. In the reaction above, there are 4 moles of gas on the reactants side (1 mole of N₂ and 3 moles of H₂) and 2 moles of gas on the product side (2 moles of NH₃).\n\nTherefore, when the pressure is increased, the equilibrium will shift towards the side with fewer moles of gas, which is the side with ammonia gas (NH₃). As a result, the yield of ammonia gas will increase.\n\nIn summary, increasing the pressure of the system will cause the equilibrium to shift towards the side with fewer moles of gas, which in this case is the ammonia gas (NH₃). This will lead to an increase in the yield of ammonia gas, as predicted by Le Chatelier's principle."
