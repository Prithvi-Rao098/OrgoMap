    "message_2": "In SF6 (sulfur hexafluoride) molecule, the central atom is sulfur. To determine the hybridization of the central atom, we need to consider the number of electron domains around it.\n\nSulfur has 6 valence electrons, and each fluorine atom contributes 1 electron, making a total of 12 electrons around the sulfur atom. These 12 electrons form 6 electron domains (6 single bonds with 6 fluorine atoms).\n\nAccording to the VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) theory, the electron domains will arrange themselves in a way to minimize repulsion. In the case of SF6, the 6 electron domains arrange themselves in an octahedral geometry.\n\nTo accommodate 6 electron domains in an octahedral geometry, the central sulfur atom needs to use six orbitals. The hybridization that allows for this is sp3d2 hybridization. So, the hybridization of the central atom (sulfur) in the SF6 molecule is sp3d2."
