    "message_2": "To find the rate constant (k) for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide at 25°C, we can use the given equation:\n\nk = rate/[H2O2]\n\nwhere rate is the rate of decomposition (1.2 x 10^-5 M/s) and [H2O2] is the initial concentration of hydrogen peroxide (0.02 M).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nk = (1.2 x 10^-5 M/s) / (0.02 M)\n\nk = 6 x 10^-4 s^-1\n\nThe rate constant for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide at 25°C is 6 x 10^-4 s^-1."
