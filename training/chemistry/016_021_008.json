    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of polymerization (ΔHºp) for the reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔHºp = ΔHfº(products) - ΔHfº(reactants)\n\nIn this case, the reactants are ethylene (C2H4(g)) and the products are polyethylene ((C2H4)n(s)). We are given the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHfº) for both substances:\n\nΔHfº(C2H4(g)) = 52.3 kJ/mol\nΔHfº((C2H4)n(s)) = -128.2 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔHºp = (-128.2 kJ/mol) - (52.3 kJ/mol)\n\nΔHºp = -180.5 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy of polymerization for the reaction is -180.5 kJ/mol."
