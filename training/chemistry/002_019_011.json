    "message_2": "Sodium chloride (NaCl), commonly known as table salt, does not have a specific boiling point like pure substances. Instead, it decomposes at high temperatures. When heated, NaCl starts to decompose at around 801째C (1,474째F) and fully decomposes to its constituent elements, sodium and chlorine, at about 1,465째C (2,669째F). These temperatures are applicable at a pressure of 1 atm."
