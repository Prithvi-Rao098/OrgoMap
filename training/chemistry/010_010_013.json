    "message_2": "To determine the maximum amount of electrical work that can be obtained from the reaction, we need to first find the cell potential (E_cell) and the number of moles of electrons transferred (n) in the redox reaction.\n\nThe half-reactions for the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) and the copper electrode are as follows:\n\nSHE: 2H⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → H₂(g)   E° = 0 V (by definition)\nCu: Cu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Cu(s)   E° = +0.34 V\n\nThe overall cell reaction is:\n2H⁺(aq) + Cu²⁺(aq) → H₂(g) + Cu(s)\n\nThe cell potential (E_cell) is the difference between the reduction potentials of the two half-reactions:\nE_cell = E°(Cu) - E°(SHE) = 0.34 V - 0 V = 0.34 V\n\nThe number of moles of electrons transferred (n) in the redox reaction is 2, as seen in the balanced half-reactions.\n\nNow, we can use the Nernst equation to find the cell potential under non-standard conditions:\n\nE = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\n\nWhere:\nE = cell potential under non-standard conditions\nE° = standard cell potential\nR = gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\nT = temperature (298 K)\nn = number of moles of electrons transferred\nF = Faraday's constant (96485 C/mol)\nQ = reaction quotient\n\nFor the reaction quotient (Q), we have:\n\nQ = [H₂(g)] / ([H⁺(aq)]²[ Cu²⁺(aq)])\n\nSince the concentration of H₂(g) is at atmospheric pressure, we can assume it to be 1 M. The concentrations of H⁺(aq) and Cu²⁺(aq) are given as 1.0 M and 1.25 M, respectively. Thus, Q = 1 / (1² * 1.25) = 0.8.\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Nernst equation:\n\nE = 0.34 V - (8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K / (2 * 96485 C/mol)) * ln(0.8)\nE ≈ 0.34 V - 0.0087 V = 0.3313 V\n\nThe maximum electrical work (W) can be obtained using the following equation:\n\nW = -nFE\n\nW = -(2 mol)(96485 C/mol)(0.3313 V)\nW ≈ -63934 J\n\nThe maximum amount of electrical work that can be obtained from the reaction is approximately -63934 J (negative sign indicates work done by the system)."
