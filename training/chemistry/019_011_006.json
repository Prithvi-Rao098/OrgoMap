    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the formation of methane (CH4) from its elements carbon (C) and hydrogen (H2) at standard conditions, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔHf(CH4) = ΣΔHf(products) - ΣΔHf(reactants)\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the formation of methane is:\n\nC (s) + 2H2 (g) → CH4 (g)\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) for elements in their standard state is 0 kJ/mol. Therefore, ΔHf(C) = 0 kJ/mol and ΔHf(H2) = 0 kJ/mol.\n\nThe given thermodynamic data is the enthalpy of combustion (ΔHc) of methane, which is -890.3 kJ/mol. We can use this information to find the enthalpy of formation of methane.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane is:\n\nCH4 (g) + 2O2 (g) → CO2 (g) + 2H2O (l)\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation for CO2 (g) and H2O (l) are -393.5 kJ/mol and -285.8 kJ/mol, respectively.\n\nUsing the enthalpy of combustion equation:\n\nΔHc(CH4) = ΣΔHf(products) - ΣΔHf(reactants)\n\n-890.3 kJ/mol = [1 × (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 × (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [ΔHf(CH4) + 2 × 0 kJ/mol]\n\n-890.3 kJ/mol = -965.1 kJ/mol - ΔHf(CH4)\n\nNow, solve for ΔHf(CH4):\n\nΔHf(CH4) = -965.1 kJ/mol + 890.3 kJ/mol\nΔHf(CH4) = -74.8 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the formation of methane (CH4) from its elements carbon (C) and hydrogen (H2) at standard conditions is -74.8 kJ/mol."
