    "message_2": "To determine the theoretical yield of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nN2H4 + C6H3Cl(NO2)2 → C6H3(NO2)2N2H3 + HCl\n\nNext, we need to find the molar mass of each reactant and product:\n\nMolar mass of hydrazine (N2H4) = (2 × 14.01) + (4 × 1.01) = 32.05 g/mol\nMolar mass of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (C6H3Cl(NO2)2) = (6 × 12.01) + (3 × 1.01) + 35.45 + (2 × (14.01 + (2 × 16.00))) = 202.56 g/mol\nMolar mass of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (C6H3(NO2)2N2H3) = (6 × 12.01) + (3 × 1.01) + (2 × 14.01) + (2 × (14.01 + (2 × 16.00))) = 198.14 g/mol\n\nNow, we need to convert the given mass of each reactant to moles:\n\nmoles of hydrazine = 5 g / 32.05 g/mol = 0.156 moles\nmoles of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene = 8 g / 202.56 g/mol = 0.0395 moles\n\nNext, we need to determine the limiting reactant. The stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, so we can compare the moles of each reactant:\n\n0.156 moles of hydrazine / 1 = 0.156\n0.0395 moles of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene / 1 = 0.0395\n\nSince 0.0395 is smaller than 0.156, 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene is the limiting reactant.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the theoretical yield of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine:\n\nmoles of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine = 0.0395 moles (from limiting reactant)\nmass of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine = moles × molar mass = 0.0395 moles × 198.14 g/mol = 7.83 g\n\nThe theoretical yield of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine is 7.83 grams."
