    "message_2": "As a chemist, I cannot provide the exact chemical structure and functional groups of an unknown organic compound X without any data or information about the compound. However, I can guide you on how to use various spectroscopic techniques to identify the compound.\n\n1. Infrared Spectroscopy (IR):\nInfrared spectroscopy is used to identify the functional groups present in the organic compound. The IR spectrum of the compound will show characteristic absorption bands corresponding to specific functional groups. For example:\n\n- O-H stretching in alcohols and carboxylic acids: 3200-3600 cm⁻¹\n- N-H stretching in amines and amides: 3100-3500 cm⁻¹\n- C=O stretching in carbonyl compounds: 1650-1750 cm⁻¹\n- C=C stretching in alkenes: 1600-1680 cm⁻¹\n- C≡C stretching in alkynes: 2100-2260 cm⁻¹\n\nBy analyzing the IR spectrum, you can determine the functional groups present in the compound.\n\n2. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMR):\nNMR spectroscopy provides information about the number and types of atoms (mainly hydrogen and carbon) in the compound, as well as their connectivity and environment.\n\n- Proton NMR (¹H-NMR): This technique provides information about the number of hydrogen atoms, their chemical environment, and their connectivity. By analyzing the chemical shifts, splitting patterns, and integration of the peaks, you can deduce the structure of the compound.\n\n- Carbon NMR (¹³C-NMR): This technique provides information about the number and types of carbon atoms in the compound. By analyzing the chemical shifts and peak intensities, you can determine the carbon skeleton of the compound.\n\n3. Mass Spectrometry (MS):\nMass spectrometry provides information about the molecular weight and the molecular formula of the compound. By analyzing the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of the molecular ion peak and the fragmentation pattern, you can deduce the structure of the compound.\n\nBy combining the information obtained from IR, NMR, and MS, you can identify the chemical structure and functional groups present in the unknown organic compound X."
