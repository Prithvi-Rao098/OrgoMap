    "message_2": "In a single replacement reaction between iron (Fe) and hydrochloric acid (HCl), iron replaces hydrogen in the acid, resulting in the formation of iron(II) chloride (FeCl₂) and hydrogen gas (H₂). The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nFe (s) + 2 HCl (aq) → FeCl₂ (aq) + H₂ (g)"
