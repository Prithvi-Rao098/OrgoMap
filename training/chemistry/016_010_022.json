    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in water, we need to determine the amount of heat absorbed per mole of NaOH dissolved. We are given the heat absorbed by the solution (128.0 kJ/mol) and the molar concentration of the solution (0.1 M).\n\nFirst, let's determine the amount of heat absorbed when 1 mole of NaOH is dissolved in water. We know that the heat absorbed by the solution is 128.0 kJ/mol, so:\n\nq = 128.0 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we need to find the mass of the solution. Since the molar concentration of the solution is 0.1 M, this means that there are 0.1 moles of NaOH in 1 L (1000 mL) of the solution. The density of the solution is 1.00 g/mL, so the mass of 1 L of the solution is:\n\nmass = density × volume\nmass = 1.00 g/mL × 1000 mL\nmass = 1000 g\n\nNow, we can calculate the change in temperature (ΔT) of the solution using the heat absorbed (q), the mass of the solution (m), and the specific heat capacity of the solution (Cp):\n\nq = m × Cp × ΔT\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for ΔT:\n\nΔT = q / (m × Cp)\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nΔT = 128,000 J / (1000 g × 4.18 J/g⋅K)\nΔT = 128,000 J / 4180 J/K\nΔT = 30.62 K\n\nNow that we have the change in temperature, we can calculate the enthalpy of solution (ΔH) using the heat absorbed (q) and the moles of NaOH dissolved:\n\nΔH = q / moles of NaOH\n\nSince there are 0.1 moles of NaOH in 1 L of the solution:\n\nΔH = 128,000 J / 0.1 mol\nΔH = 1,280,000 J/mol\n\nConverting to kJ/mol:\n\nΔH = 1,280 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy of solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in water is 1,280 kJ/mol."
