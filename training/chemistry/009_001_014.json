    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the radioactive decay formula:\n\nA = A₀ * (1/2)^(t/T)\n\nwhere:\nA = final activity\nA₀ = initial activity\nt = time elapsed\nT = half-life of the isotope\n\nGiven:\nA₀ = 200 Bq\nT = 10 days\nt = 30 days\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nA = 200 * (1/2)^(30/10)\n\nA = 200 * (1/2)^3\n\nA = 200 * (1/8)\n\nA = 25 Bq\n\nAfter 30 days, the activity of the radioactive isotope will be 25 Bq."
