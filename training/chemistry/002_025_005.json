    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic moment of a cobalt (II) ion (Co2+) in an octahedral field, we need to determine the electron configuration of the ion and then find the number of unpaired electrons. Finally, we will use the spin-only formula to calculate the magnetic moment.\n\nCobalt has an atomic number of 27, so its ground state electron configuration is [Ar] 4s² 3d⁷. When cobalt loses two electrons to form the Co²⁺ ion, its electron configuration becomes [Ar] 3d⁷ → [Ar] 3d⁵.\n\nIn an octahedral field, the five d orbitals split into two energy levels: the lower-energy t₂g orbitals (dxy, dyz, and dxz) and the higher-energy e_g orbitals (dz² and dx²-y²). The ligand field strength (800 cm⁻¹) does not affect the electron configuration in this case, as it only influences the energy gap between the t₂g and e_g orbitals.\n\nThe electron configuration of Co²⁺ in an octahedral field is:\n\nt₂g ↑↓ ↑↓ ↑ (3 electrons in t₂g orbitals)\ne_g ↑↑ (2 electrons in e_g orbitals)\n\nThere are a total of 5 unpaired electrons in the Co²⁺ ion.\n\nNow, we can use the spin-only formula to calculate the magnetic moment (μ):\n\nμ = √(n(n+2)) μ_B\n\nwhere n is the number of unpaired electrons and μ_B is the Bohr magneton (approximately 9.27 × 10⁻²⁴ Am²).\n\nμ = √(5(5+2)) μ_B\nμ = √(5(7)) μ_B\nμ = √35 μ_B\n\nThe magnetic moment of the Co²⁺ ion in an octahedral field is approximately √35 μ_B."
