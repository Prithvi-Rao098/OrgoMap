    "message_2": "The optimal ratio of acetic anhydride to salicylic acid for the highest yield of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) during the synthesis process is 1:1, based on their stoichiometry. \n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the synthesis of acetylsalicylic acid is:\n\nC7H6O3 (salicylic acid) + C4H6O3 (acetic anhydride) â†’ C9H8O4 (acetylsalicylic acid) + C2H4O2 (acetic acid)\n\nAs per the balanced equation, one mole of salicylic acid reacts with one mole of acetic anhydride to produce one mole of acetylsalicylic acid. Therefore, the optimal molar ratio is 1:1. To achieve the highest yield, it is essential to use equimolar amounts of both reactants."
