    "message_2": "To predict the molecular geometry of a molecule with three bonding pairs and no lone pairs using the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory, follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the central atom: Identify the central atom in the molecule, which is usually the least electronegative element or the one with the highest connectivity.\n\n2. Count the electron groups: Count the number of bonding pairs and lone pairs around the central atom. In this case, there are three bonding pairs and no lone pairs.\n\n3. Determine the electron group geometry: Based on the number of electron groups, determine the electron group geometry. For three electron groups, the electron group geometry is trigonal planar.\n\n4. Determine the molecular geometry: Since there are no lone pairs, the molecular geometry will be the same as the electron group geometry. In this case, the molecular geometry is trigonal planar.\n\nSo, a molecule with three bonding pairs and no lone pairs will have a trigonal planar molecular geometry according to the VSEPR theory. Examples of such molecules include BF3 (boron trifluoride) and SO3 (sulfur trioxide)."
