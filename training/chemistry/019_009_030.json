    "message_2": "To calculate the standard free energy change (ΔG°) for the redox reaction, we can use the Nernst equation:\n\nΔG° = -n * F * ΔE°\n\nwhere:\nΔG° = standard free energy change\nn = number of moles of electrons transferred in the redox reaction\nF = Faraday's constant (96,485 C/mol)\nΔE° = standard cell potential (difference in standard reduction potentials)\n\nFirst, we need to determine the number of moles of electrons transferred (n) in the redox reaction. The balanced half-reactions are:\n\nFe3+ (aq) + e- → Fe2+ (aq) (reduction half-reaction)\nH2 (g) → 2 H+ (aq) + 2 e- (oxidation half-reaction)\n\nSince there are 2 moles of Fe3+ reduced to Fe2+ in the overall reaction, the total number of moles of electrons transferred (n) is 2.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the standard cell potential (ΔE°). Since the reaction is written as a reduction, we can use the given standard reduction potentials:\n\nΔE° = E°(cathode) - E°(anode)\nΔE° = E°(Fe3+/Fe2+) - E°(H+/H2)\nΔE° = (-0.771 V) - (0.00 V)\nΔE° = -0.771 V\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Nernst equation to calculate the standard free energy change (ΔG°):\n\nΔG° = -n * F * ΔE°\nΔG° = -2 * 96,485 C/mol * (-0.771 V)\nΔG° = 148,949.47 J/mol\n\nSince the standard free energy change is typically expressed in kJ/mol, we can convert the value:\n\nΔG° = 148,949.47 J/mol * (1 kJ / 1000 J)\nΔG° = 148.95 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard free energy change for the given redox reaction under standard conditions is 148.95 kJ/mol."
