    "message_2": "To find the enthalpy change for the reaction in kJ/mol, we can use the given information:\n\nThe combustion of 0.50 moles of methane gas releases 802.3 kJ of heat.\n\nFirst, we need to find the amount of heat released per mole of methane:\n\n802.3 kJ / 0.50 moles = 1604.6 kJ/mol\n\nSince the combustion of methane is an exothermic reaction (releases heat), the enthalpy change for the reaction is negative:\n\nÎ”H = -1604.6 kJ/mol"
