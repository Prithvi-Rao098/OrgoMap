    "message_2": "Benzaldehyde (C6H5CHO) is an aromatic aldehyde. The functional group present in benzaldehyde is the aldehyde group, which is represented by the structure -CHO. The aldehyde group consists of a carbonyl group (C=O) with a hydrogen atom attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n\nWhen benzaldehyde reacts with Tollen's reagent (ammoniacal silver nitrate, [Ag(NH3)2]NO3), it undergoes an oxidation reaction. Tollen's reagent is a mild oxidizing agent that selectively oxidizes aldehydes to carboxylic acids without affecting other functional groups like C=C double bonds.\n\nThe chemical reaction between benzaldehyde and Tollen's reagent can be represented as follows:\n\nC6H5CHO + 2[Ag(NH3)2]NO3 + 3H2O â†’ C6H5COOH + 2Ag + 4NH3 + 2HNO3\n\nIn this reaction, benzaldehyde (C6H5CHO) is oxidized to benzoic acid (C6H5COOH), while the silver ions in Tollen's reagent are reduced to metallic silver (Ag). The formation of metallic silver as a precipitate is a positive test for the presence of an aldehyde functional group. This reaction is also known as the \"silver mirror test\" because the metallic silver formed can deposit on the inner surface of the test tube, creating a shiny silver mirror appearance."
