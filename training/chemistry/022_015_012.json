    "message_1": "A chemistry student added 2 grams of sodium hydroxide to 50 ml of hydrochloric acid with a concentration of 0.5 M. After the reaction was complete, the student collected 1.5 grams of sodium chloride. Calculate the percent yield of sodium chloride.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the percent yield of sodium chloride, we first need to determine the theoretical yield based on the limiting reactant. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nNaOH + HCl → NaCl + H₂O\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of each reactant:\n\nMoles of NaOH:\n2 g NaOH × (1 mol NaOH / 40.00 g NaOH) = 0.050 mol NaOH\n\nMoles of HCl:\n0.5 mol/L × 0.050 L = 0.025 mol HCl\n\nSince there is a 1:1 ratio between NaOH and HCl in the balanced equation, we can determine that HCl is the limiting reactant. Therefore, the theoretical yield of NaCl will be based on the moles of HCl.\n\nMoles of NaCl (theoretical yield):\n0.025 mol HCl × (1 mol NaCl / 1 mol HCl) = 0.025 mol NaCl\n\nNow, we need to convert the moles of NaCl to grams:\n\nMass of NaCl (theoretical yield):\n0.025 mol NaCl × (58.44 g NaCl / 1 mol NaCl) = 1.461 g NaCl\n\nNow we can calculate the percent yield:\n\nPercent Yield = (Actual Yield / Theoretical Yield) × 100\nPercent Yield = (1.5 g NaCl / 1.461 g NaCl) × 100 = 102.67%\n\nHowever, a percent yield greater than 100% is not possible, as it would mean that more product was formed than theoretically possible. This discrepancy could be due to experimental error or impurities in the reactants. In this case, we would report the percent yield as 100%."
