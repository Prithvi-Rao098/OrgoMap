    "message_2": "To find the heat capacity of the 50 gram sample of water, we can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat absorbed (in Joules), m is the mass of the sample (in grams), c is the specific heat capacity of water (4.18 J/g°C), and ΔT is the change in temperature (in °C).\n\nWe are given the following information:\n\nq = 1500 J\nm = 50 g\nΔT = 35°C - 25°C = 10°C\n\nWe need to find the value of c. Rearranging the formula to solve for c, we get:\n\nc = q / (mΔT)\n\nNow, plug in the given values:\n\nc = 1500 J / (50 g × 10°C)\n\nc = 1500 J / 500 g°C\n\nc = 3 J/g°C\n\nThe heat capacity of the 50 gram sample of water is 3 J/g°C."
