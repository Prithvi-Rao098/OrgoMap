    "message_2": "The electrophilic addition reaction of propene (C3H6) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) involves the following steps:\n\n1. Formation of the electrophile:\nHydrochloric acid (HCl) dissociates into H+ and Cl- ions. The H+ ion acts as an electrophile in this reaction.\n\n2. Nucleophilic attack by the alkene:\nPropene, which is an alkene, has a double bond between two carbon atoms. This double bond consists of a sigma bond and a pi bond. The pi bond has a high electron density, making it a nucleophile. The nucleophilic pi bond attacks the electrophilic H+ ion, forming a bond between one of the carbon atoms and the hydrogen atom. This results in the breaking of the pi bond.\n\n3. Formation of the carbocation intermediate:\nAfter the addition of the hydrogen atom, a carbocation intermediate is formed. The positive charge is located on the carbon atom that did not bond with the hydrogen atom. In the case of propene, a secondary carbocation is formed, as the positively charged carbon is bonded to two other carbon atoms.\n\n4. Attack by the nucleophile:\nThe negatively charged chloride ion (Cl-) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the positively charged carbon atom in the carbocation intermediate. This leads to the formation of a new bond between the carbon atom and the chloride ion.\n\n5. Formation of the final product:\nThe electrophilic addition reaction is now complete, and the final product is 2-chloropropane (C3H7Cl), an alkyl halide.\n\nOverall, the mechanism of the electrophilic addition reaction of propene and hydrochloric acid can be summarized as follows:\n\nPropene + HCl â†’ 2-chloropropane"
