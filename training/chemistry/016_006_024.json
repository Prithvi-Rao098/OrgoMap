    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of 1 mole of methane gas (CH4) at standard conditions, we need to use the standard enthalpies of formation for the reactants and products involved in the reaction.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane is:\n\nCH₄(g) + 2O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l)\n\nThe standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) for the substances involved in the reaction are:\n\nΔHf°(CH₄) = -74.8 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(O₂) = 0 kJ/mol (since it is an element in its standard state)\nΔHf°(CO₂) = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(H₂O) = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nUsing Hess's Law, the enthalpy change for the reaction (ΔHrxn) can be calculated as follows:\n\nΔHrxn = [ΔHf°(products) - ΔHf°(reactants)]\n\nΔHrxn = [1 × (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 × (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [1 × (-74.8 kJ/mol) + 2 × 0 kJ/mol]\n\nΔHrxn = (-393.5 - 571.6 + 74.8) kJ/mol\n\nΔHrxn = -890.3 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the enthalpy change for the combustion of 1 mole of methane gas at standard conditions is -890.3 kJ/mol."
