    "message_2": "Adding more reactant to a chemical reaction at equilibrium affects the equilibrium position according to Le Chatelier's principle. Le Chatelier's principle states that if a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in concentration, temperature, or pressure, the system will adjust its equilibrium position to counteract the change.\n\nWhen more reactant is added to a reaction at equilibrium, the concentration of the reactant increases. According to Le Chatelier's principle, the system will respond by shifting the equilibrium position to consume the added reactant and restore equilibrium. This shift will result in the formation of more product.\n\nExample: Consider the following reversible reaction at equilibrium:\n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) â‡Œ 2NH3(g)\n\nIn this reaction, nitrogen gas (N2) reacts with hydrogen gas (H2) to form ammonia gas (NH3). If we increase the concentration of N2 or H2, the equilibrium will shift to the right, favoring the formation of more NH3 to counteract the increase in reactant concentration.\n\nIn summary, adding more reactant to a chemical reaction at equilibrium will cause the equilibrium position to shift in the direction that consumes the added reactant, resulting in the formation of more product. This behavior is consistent with Le Chatelier's principle, which predicts how systems at equilibrium will respond to changes in concentration, temperature, or pressure."
