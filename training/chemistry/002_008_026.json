    "message_2": "To find the empirical formula of magnesium chloride, we need to determine the mole ratio of magnesium (Mg) to chlorine (Cl) in the compound. \n\n1. First, let's assume we have a 100 g sample of magnesium chloride. This makes it easier to work with the percentages given. In this case, we have 45.30 g of Mg and 54.70 g of Cl.\n\n2. Next, we need to convert the mass of each element to moles. To do this, we'll use the molar mass of each element. The molar mass of Mg is 24.31 g/mol, and the molar mass of Cl is 35.45 g/mol.\n\nMoles of Mg = (45.30 g Mg) / (24.31 g/mol) = 1.863 moles Mg\nMoles of Cl = (54.70 g Cl) / (35.45 g/mol) = 1.543 moles Cl\n\n3. Now, we need to find the simplest whole number ratio of moles of Mg to moles of Cl. To do this, we'll divide both numbers of moles by the smallest number of moles.\n\n1.863 moles Mg / 1.543 moles = 1.207\n1.543 moles Cl / 1.543 moles = 1\n\nSince the ratio is close to 1:1, we can round the numbers to the nearest whole numbers.\n\n4. The empirical formula of magnesium chloride is Mg1Cl1, which can be written as MgCl."
