    "message_2": "When a solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH) is mixed with a solution of copper(II) sulfate (CuSO4), a double replacement reaction occurs. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\n2 KOH (aq) + CuSO4 (aq) â†’ K2SO4 (aq) + Cu(OH)2 (s)\n\nThe precipitate formed during this reaction is copper(II) hydroxide (Cu(OH)2), which is a blue solid."
