    "message_2": "To find the enthalpy change for the reaction between hydrogen gas and chlorine gas to form hydrogen chloride gas, we need to manipulate the given thermochemical equations to obtain the desired reaction. The target reaction is:\n\nH2(g) + Cl2(g) → 2HCl(g)\n\nFirst, reverse the second equation to get:\n\nH2(g) + Cl2(g) → 2HCl(g)    ΔH2' = -184.6 kJ/mol\n\nNow, the target reaction is the same as the reversed second equation. Therefore, the enthalpy change for the reaction between hydrogen gas and chlorine gas to form hydrogen chloride gas is:\n\nΔH = ΔH2' = -184.6 kJ/mol"
