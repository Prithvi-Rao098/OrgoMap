Given that the standard enthalpy change of combustion of methane is -890.4 kJ/mol.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the formation of 2 moles of water vapor (H2O(g)), we can use the given information about the combustion of methane (CH4(g)).\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane is:\n\nCH4(g) + 2O2(g) â†’ CO2(g) + 2H2O(g)\n\nThe standard enthalpy change of combustion of methane is given as -890.4 kJ/mol. This value corresponds to the formation of 1 mole of CO2(g) and 2 moles of H2O(g) from 1 mole of CH4(g).\n\nSince we are only interested in the enthalpy change for the formation of 2 moles of water vapor, we can ignore the formation of CO2(g) in this case.\n\nThe enthalpy change for the formation of 2 moles of H2O(g) is the same as the enthalpy change for the combustion of 1 mole of CH4(g), which is -890.4 kJ/mol.\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the formation of 2 moles of water vapor (H2O(g)) is -890.4 kJ/mol."
