    "message_2": "The most effective metal alloy composition for jet engine turbines in commercial airplanes, considering the requirements of strength, durability, and operational temperature range, would be a nickel-based superalloy. One such example is Inconel 718, which is composed of approximately:\n\n- 50-55% Nickel (Ni)\n- 17-21% Chromium (Cr)\n- 4.75-5.5% Niobium (Nb)\n- 2.8-3.3% Molybdenum (Mo)\n- 1.0% Titanium (Ti)\n- 0.35-0.80% Aluminum (Al)\n- 0.2-0.8% Cobalt (Co)\n- 0.08-0.15% Carbon (C)\n- 0.015% max Phosphorus (P)\n- 0.015% max Sulfur (S)\n- 0.006-0.01% Boron (B)\n- Balance of Iron (Fe) and other trace elements\n\nThis specific composition of Inconel 718 provides excellent strength, durability, and resistance to high temperatures, making it suitable for use in jet engine turbines. Nickel-based superalloys like Inconel 718 are widely used in the aerospace industry due to their ability to maintain their mechanical properties at high temperatures, resist corrosion and oxidation, and withstand the stresses experienced during operation."
