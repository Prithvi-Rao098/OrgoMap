    "message_2": "To determine the empirical formula of a compound, we need to find the simplest whole number ratio of the elements present in the compound. In this case, we have 14.6% nitrogen and 85.4% oxygen by mass. \n\n1. Assume we have 100 grams of the compound. This means we have 14.6 grams of nitrogen and 85.4 grams of oxygen.\n\n2. Convert the mass of each element to moles by dividing by their respective molar masses. The molar mass of nitrogen (N) is 14.01 g/mol, and the molar mass of oxygen (O) is 16.00 g/mol.\n\nMoles of nitrogen (N) = 14.6 g / 14.01 g/mol = 1.042 moles\nMoles of oxygen (O) = 85.4 g / 16.00 g/mol = 5.338 moles\n\n3. Divide the moles of each element by the smallest number of moles to get the mole ratio.\n\nMole ratio of N: 1.042 / 1.042 = 1\nMole ratio of O: 5.338 / 1.042 ≈ 5.12 (approximately 5)\n\n4. The empirical formula is the simplest whole number ratio of the elements, which is NO₅ in this case."
