    "message_1": "A chemistry student must determine the chemical identity of a compound with the molecular formula C6H12O2 using NMR spectroscopy. The NMR spectrum shows a singlet at 2.1 ppm and two triplets at 1.2 ppm and 1.6 ppm, respectively. What is the identity of the compound?",
    "message_2": "Based on the molecular formula C6H12O2 and the NMR spectrum data provided, the compound is likely to be an ester. The singlet at 2.1 ppm corresponds to the methyl group (CH3) adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O). The two triplets at 1.2 ppm and 1.6 ppm correspond to the two methylene groups (CH2) in the compound.\n\nTaking these observations into account, the compound can be identified as ethyl propionate, which has the following structure:\n\nCH3CH2COOCH2CH3\n\nThe NMR spectrum data matches the structure of ethyl propionate, with a methyl group adjacent to the carbonyl group and two methylene groups in the molecule."
