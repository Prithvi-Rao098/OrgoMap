    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction, we can use the formula:\n\nKc = [SO3]^2 / ([SO2]^2 * [O2])\n\nwhere the concentrations of the species at equilibrium are given as:\n\n[SO2] = 0.12 M\n[O2] = 0.04 M\n[SO3] = 0.16 M\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nKc = (0.16)^2 / ((0.12)^2 * (0.04))\n\nKc = 0.0256 / (0.0144 * 0.04)\n\nKc = 0.0256 / 0.000576\n\nKc ≈ 44.44\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction at 25°C is approximately 44.44."
