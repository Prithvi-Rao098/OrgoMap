    "message_2": "To calculate the expected yield of benzocaine, we first need to determine the limiting reagent in the reaction. The reaction between p-aminobenzoic acid and ethanol to form benzocaine is as follows:\n\np-aminobenzoic acid + ethanol â†’ benzocaine + water\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of each reactant:\n\n1. p-aminobenzoic acid: \nMolecular weight = 137.14 g/mol\n5 g of p-aminobenzoic acid = 5 g / 137.14 g/mol = 0.0364 mol\n\n2. Ethanol:\nMolecular weight = 46.07 g/mol\nDensity of ethanol = 0.789 g/mL\n10 mL of ethanol = 10 mL * 0.789 g/mL = 7.89 g\n7.89 g of ethanol = 7.89 g / 46.07 g/mol = 0.171 mol\n\nNow, we need to determine the limiting reagent. The stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, so we can compare the moles of each reactant:\n\n0.0364 mol p-aminobenzoic acid : 0.171 mol ethanol\n\nSince p-aminobenzoic acid is present in a smaller amount, it is the limiting reagent.\n\nNow, we can calculate the expected yield of benzocaine:\n\nMoles of benzocaine = moles of limiting reagent = 0.0364 mol\nMolecular weight of benzocaine = 165.19 g/mol\nExpected yield of benzocaine = 0.0364 mol * 165.19 g/mol = 6.01 g\n\nSo, the expected yield of benzocaine is approximately 6.01 grams."
