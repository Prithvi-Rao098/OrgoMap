    "message_2": "The decomposition of potassium chlorate (KClO3) is a thermal decomposition reaction, which means it breaks down into simpler substances when heated. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\n2 KClO3 (s) â†’ 2 KCl (s) + 3 O2 (g)\n\nWhen potassium chlorate is heated, it decomposes into potassium chloride (KCl) and oxygen gas (O2). In this reaction, 2 moles of potassium chlorate produce 2 moles of potassium chloride and 3 moles of oxygen gas."
