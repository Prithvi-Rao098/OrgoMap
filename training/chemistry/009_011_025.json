    "message_2": "To determine the age of the rock, we can use the formula for radioactive decay:\n\nN = N0 * (1/2)^(t/T)\n\nwhere N is the current amount of the radioactive isotope (62.5 grams), N0 is the initial amount of the isotope (500 grams), t is the age of the rock (which we want to find), and T is the half-life of the isotope (1 million years).\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for t:\n\nt = T * (log(N/N0) / log(1/2))\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nt = 1,000,000 * (log(62.5/500) / log(1/2))\n\nt â‰ˆ 2,000,000 years\n\nThe age of the rock is approximately 2 million years."
