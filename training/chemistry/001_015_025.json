    "message_2": "To design a retrosynthesis for the synthesis of 2-phenylpropionic acid from benzene, ethylene, and CO₂, we will break down the target molecule into simpler precursors and identify the reactions needed to form the desired product. Here's a possible retrosynthetic pathway:\n\nTarget molecule: 2-phenylpropionic acid (C₆H₅CH₂CH₂COOH)\n\n1. Break the C-C bond between the phenyl group and the propionic acid moiety.\n   Precursors: Benzene (C₆H₆) and Propionic acid (CH₃CH₂COOH)\n\n2. To synthesize propionic acid from ethylene and CO₂, we can use the hydrocarboxylation reaction (also known as the Kolbe-Schmitt reaction).\n   Precursors: Ethylene (C₂H₄) and CO₂\n\nRetrosynthetic pathway:\n\nStep 1: Benzene + Propionic acid → 2-phenylpropionic acid\nStep 2: Ethylene + CO₂ → Propionic acid\n\nForward synthesis:\n\nStep 1: Hydrocarboxylation of ethylene\nC₂H₄ + CO₂ → CH₃CH₂COOH (Propionic acid)\n\nStep 2: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene\nC₆H₆ + CH₃CH₂COOH → C₆H₅CH₂CH₂COOH (2-phenylpropionic acid)\n\nIn this forward synthesis, we first perform the hydrocarboxylation of ethylene to form propionic acid. Then, we carry out a Friedel-Crafts alkylation reaction between benzene and propionic acid to form the desired product, 2-phenylpropionic acid."
