    "message_1": "A chemistry student is asked to find the standard cell potential for the redox reaction: \n\nMg(s) | Mg²⁺(aq, 0.1 M) || Cu²⁺(aq, 0.01 M) | Cu(s) \n\nGiven that the standard potential for the reduction of Mg²⁺ is -2.37 V and for the reduction of Cu²⁺ is +0.34 V. The student should show how to calculate the cell potential and determine if the reaction will proceed spontaneously or not.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the cell potential, we first need to determine the half-reactions for the redox reaction. In this case, we have:\n\nMg(s) → Mg²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ (oxidation half-reaction)\nCu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Cu(s) (reduction half-reaction)\n\nNext, we need to find the standard cell potential (E°) for the reaction. We can do this by subtracting the standard potential of the oxidation half-reaction from the standard potential of the reduction half-reaction:\n\nE°(cell) = E°(reduction) - E°(oxidation)\n\nSince the reduction of Mg²⁺ has a standard potential of -2.37 V and the reduction of Cu²⁺ has a standard potential of +0.34 V, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nE°(cell) = (+0.34 V) - (-2.37 V)\n\nE°(cell) = +0.34 V + 2.37 V = +2.71 V\n\nNow that we have the standard cell potential, we can determine if the reaction will proceed spontaneously or not. A positive cell potential indicates that the reaction will proceed spontaneously, while a negative cell potential indicates that the reaction will not proceed spontaneously.\n\nSince the cell potential is +2.71 V, which is positive, the reaction will proceed spontaneously."
