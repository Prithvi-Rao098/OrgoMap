    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of vaporization of water, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nΔHvap = (Tb * ΔvapS) / R\n\nwhere ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization, Tb is the boiling point in Kelvin, ΔvapS is the entropy of vaporization, and R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K).\n\nFirst, we need to find the entropy of vaporization (ΔvapS). We can do this using the following equation:\n\nΔvapS = Cp,gas - Cp,liquid\n\nwhere Cp,gas is the molar heat capacity of steam and Cp,liquid is the molar heat capacity of liquid water.\n\nWe are given the specific heat capacities of liquid water (4.18 J/g·°C) and steam (1.84 J/g·°C). To convert these to molar heat capacities, we multiply by the molar mass of water (18.015 g/mol):\n\nCp,liquid = 4.18 J/g·°C * 18.015 g/mol = 75.3 J/mol·°C\nCp,gas = 1.84 J/g·°C * 18.015 g/mol = 33.2 J/mol·°C\n\nNow we can find the entropy of vaporization:\n\nΔvapS = Cp,gas - Cp,liquid = 33.2 J/mol·°C - 75.3 J/mol·°C = -42.1 J/mol·°C\n\nNext, we need to convert the boiling point of water to Kelvin:\n\nTb = 100°C + 273.15 = 373.15 K\n\nNow we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to find the enthalpy of vaporization:\n\nΔHvap = (Tb * ΔvapS) / R = (373.15 K * -42.1 J/mol·°C) / 8.314 J/mol·K\n\nΔHvap = -157300 J/mol\n\nSince the enthalpy of vaporization is a positive value, we take the absolute value:\n\nΔHvap = 157300 J/mol = 157.3 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy of vaporization of water is 157.3 kJ/mol."
