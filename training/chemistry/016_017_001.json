    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the formula:\n\nΔH_reaction = Σ ΔH_f_products - Σ ΔH_f_reactants\n\nwhere ΔH_reaction is the enthalpy change for the reaction, ΔH_f_products are the standard enthalpies of formation of the products, and ΔH_f_reactants are the standard enthalpies of formation of the reactants.\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\nCH4 (g) + 2O2 (g) -> CO2 (g) + 2H2O (l)\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation for the reactants are:\nΔH_f (CH4) = -74.81 kJ/mol\nΔH_f (O2) = 0 kJ/mol (since O2 is in its standard state)\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation for the products are:\nΔH_f (CO2) = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔH_f (H2O) = -285.83 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nΔH_reaction = [(-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2(-285.83 kJ/mol)] - [(-74.81 kJ/mol) + 0]\n\nΔH_reaction = (-393.5 - 571.66) - (-74.81)\n\nΔH_reaction = (-965.16) + 74.81\n\nΔH_reaction = -890.35 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change for the oxidation of methane gas to carbon dioxide and water is -890.35 kJ/mol."
