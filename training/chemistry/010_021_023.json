    "message_2": "To determine the corrosion potential of a zinc electrode coupled with a copper electrode in a solution of 0.1 M CuSO₄, we can use the Nernst equation. The Nernst equation relates the reduction potential of an electrochemical reaction to the standard reduction potential, temperature, and concentrations of the reactants and products. The equation is as follows:\n\nE = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\n\nwhere:\nE = reduction potential of the reaction\nE° = standard reduction potential of the reaction\nR = gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\nT = temperature in Kelvin (assume 298 K for room temperature)\nn = number of electrons transferred in the reaction\nF = Faraday's constant (96,485 C/mol)\nQ = reaction quotient, which is the ratio of the concentrations of the products to the reactants\n\nFor the zinc electrode, the half-reaction is:\n\nZn → Zn²⁺ + 2e⁻ (oxidation)\n\nThe standard reduction potential for this reaction is -0.76 V. However, since we are considering the oxidation of zinc, we need to reverse the sign of the standard reduction potential:\n\nE°(Zn) = +0.76 V\n\nFor the copper electrode, the half-reaction is:\n\nCu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu (reduction)\n\nThe standard reduction potential for this reaction is +0.34 V.\n\nNow, we can calculate the cell potential (E_cell) for the overall reaction:\n\nE_cell = E°(Cu) - E°(Zn)\n\nE_cell = (+0.34 V) - (+0.76 V)\n\nE_cell = -0.42 V\n\nSince the cell potential is negative, the reaction is not spontaneous, and the zinc electrode will corrode.\n\nHowever, the above calculation assumes standard conditions (1 M concentration for all ions). We are given a 0.1 M CuSO₄ solution, so we need to use the Nernst equation to account for the non-standard conditions.\n\nFor the copper half-reaction:\n\nE(Cu) = E°(Cu) - (RT/2F) * ln([Cu²⁺]/[Cu])\n\nSince [Cu] is a solid, its concentration is not included in the reaction quotient, and we only need to consider the concentration of Cu²⁺:\n\nE(Cu) = +0.34 V - (8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K / (2 * 96,485 C/mol)) * ln(0.1)\n\nE(Cu) ≈ +0.34 V - 0.0296 V\n\nE(Cu) ≈ +0.3104 V\n\nNow, we can calculate the new cell potential:\n\nE_cell = E(Cu) - E°(Zn)\n\nE_cell = (+0.3104 V) - (+0.76 V)\n\nE_cell ≈ -0.4496 V\n\nThe corrosion potential of the zinc electrode coupled with a copper electrode in a 0.1 M CuSO₄ solution is approximately -0.4496 V."
