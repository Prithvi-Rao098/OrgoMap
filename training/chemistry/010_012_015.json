    "message_1": "Calculate the amount of copper deposited on the cathode when a current of 5 amperes is passed through a copper sulfate solution for a duration of 30 minutes. The molar mass of copper is 63.55 g/mol and the Faraday constant is 96500 C/mol. The electrode area is 10 cm² and the copper sulfate solution has a concentration of 0.1 M. Assume 100% efficiency in the electrochemical reaction.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of copper deposited on the cathode, we can use Faraday's law of electrolysis, which states that the mass of a substance deposited or dissolved at an electrode is directly proportional to the amount of charge passed through the electrolyte.\n\nFirst, let's find the total charge passed through the solution. \n\nCharge (Q) = Current (I) × Time (t)\nwhere I = 5 A (amperes) and t = 30 minutes = 1800 seconds (since 1 minute = 60 seconds)\n\nQ = 5 A × 1800 s = 9000 C (coulombs)\n\nNow, we can use Faraday's law to find the moles of copper deposited:\n\nMoles of copper (n) = Charge (Q) / (Faraday constant (F) × number of electrons involved in the reaction)\n\nFor the copper sulfate solution, the half-reaction for the deposition of copper is:\n\nCu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu\n\nSo, the number of electrons involved in the reaction is 2.\n\nn = 9000 C / (96500 C/mol × 2) = 0.0468 mol\n\nNow, we can find the mass of copper deposited using the molar mass of copper:\n\nMass of copper = Moles of copper × Molar mass of copper\nMass of copper = 0.0468 mol × 63.55 g/mol = 2.976 g\n\nTherefore, the amount of copper deposited on the cathode is approximately 2.976 grams."
