    "message_2": "To determine the molecular formula of the unknown compound, we first need to consider the molecular ion peak at m/z 136. This peak represents the mass of the entire molecule. The fragment ions at m/z 91 and 43 provide information about the structure of the molecule.\n\n1. Determine the molecular formula based on the molecular ion peak (m/z 136):\n\nA molecular ion peak at m/z 136 could correspond to a molecular formula of C9H12 (9 carbon atoms * 12 amu + 12 hydrogen atoms * 1 amu = 108 + 12 = 136). This is a reasonable molecular formula to start with.\n\n2. Analyze the fragment ions:\n\nThe fragment ion at m/z 91 suggests a loss of a fragment with a mass of 45 (136 - 91 = 45). This could correspond to the loss of a CH3 (methyl) group and a C2H4 (ethylene) group (15 + 28 = 45). The fragment ion at m/z 43 could be a CH3CO+ (acetone) group.\n\n3. Propose a molecular structure:\n\nBased on the molecular formula C9H12 and the fragment ions, a possible molecular structure is 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene (also known as pseudocumene). The structure consists of a benzene ring with three methyl groups attached to carbons 1, 2, and 4.\n\nIn summary, the molecular formula of the unknown compound is C9H12, and the structure is 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene. Keep in mind that mass spectrometry data alone may not be sufficient to definitively identify a compound, and additional analytical techniques (such as NMR or IR spectroscopy) may be necessary to confirm the structure."
