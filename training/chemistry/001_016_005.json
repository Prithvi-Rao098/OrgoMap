    "message_2": "The mechanism of the nucleophilic substitution reaction between bromoethane (CH3CH2Br) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is an SN2 (Substitution Nucleophilic Bimolecular) reaction. Here's a step-by-step description of the mechanism:\n\n1. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) dissociates into a sodium cation (Na+) and a hydroxide anion (OH-). The hydroxide anion acts as a nucleophile in this reaction.\n\n2. The nucleophile (OH-) approaches the electrophilic carbon atom (the one bonded to the bromine) in bromoethane from the side opposite to the leaving group (Br-). This is because the nucleophile must attack the electrophilic carbon in a way that allows for the simultaneous breaking of the carbon-bromine bond.\n\n3. As the hydroxide anion approaches the electrophilic carbon, it forms a partial bond with the carbon atom, while the carbon-bromine bond starts to break. This results in a transition state where the carbon atom is partially bonded to both the hydroxide anion and the bromine atom. The transition state is a high-energy state and is short-lived.\n\n4. The carbon-bromine bond breaks completely, and the bromide ion (Br-) is released as a leaving group. The hydroxide anion is now fully bonded to the carbon atom, forming ethanol (CH3CH2OH).\n\n5. The sodium cation (Na+) associates with the bromide ion (Br-) to form sodium bromide (NaBr), which is a byproduct of the reaction.\n\nOverall, the reaction can be represented as:\n\nCH3CH2Br + NaOH â†’ CH3CH2OH + NaBr\n\nIn summary, the mechanism of the nucleophilic substitution reaction between bromoethane and sodium hydroxide is an SN2 reaction, involving a direct attack of the hydroxide anion on the electrophilic carbon atom, simultaneous breaking of the carbon-bromine bond, and formation of ethanol and sodium bromide as products."
