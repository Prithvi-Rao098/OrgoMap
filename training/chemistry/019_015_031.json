    "message_1": "Sure, here is a precise problem for the student to solve: \n\nWhat is the standard enthalpy change for the fusion reaction of 10.0 g of solid ice (H2O) at -10°C into liquid water (H2O) at 20°C? Assume that the heat absorbed by the water is equal to the heat released by the ice during the fusion process, and that the specific heat capacity of water is 4.18 J/g°C. (Hint: You will need to use the formula q = m * ΔH to calculate the enthalpy change, where q is the heat absorbed or released, m is the mass of the substance, and ΔH is the enthalpy change.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to consider three steps:\n\n1. Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C.\n2. Melting the ice at 0°C.\n3. Heating the liquid water from 0°C to 20°C.\n\nStep 1: Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C\nq1 = m * c_ice * ΔT1\nwhere q1 is the heat absorbed by the ice, m is the mass of the ice (10.0 g), c_ice is the specific heat capacity of ice (2.09 J/g°C), and ΔT1 is the change in temperature (10°C).\n\nq1 = 10.0 g * 2.09 J/g°C * 10°C = 209 J\n\nStep 2: Melting the ice at 0°C\nq2 = m * ΔH_fusion\nwhere q2 is the heat absorbed during the fusion process, ΔH_fusion is the enthalpy of fusion for water (333.5 J/g).\n\nq2 = 10.0 g * 333.5 J/g = 3335 J\n\nStep 3: Heating the liquid water from 0°C to 20°C\nq3 = m * c_water * ΔT2\nwhere q3 is the heat absorbed by the liquid water, c_water is the specific heat capacity of water (4.18 J/g°C), and ΔT2 is the change in temperature (20°C).\n\nq3 = 10.0 g * 4.18 J/g°C * 20°C = 836 J\n\nNow, we can find the total enthalpy change by adding the heat absorbed in each step:\n\nΔH_total = q1 + q2 + q3\nΔH_total = 209 J + 3335 J + 836 J = 4380 J\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the fusion reaction of 10.0 g of solid ice at -10°C into liquid water at 20°C is 4380 J."
