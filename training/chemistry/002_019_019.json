What would be the expected boiling point of KCl at an atmospheric pressure of 1.0 atm (760 mmHg)?",
    "message_2": "The Clausius-Clapeyron equation relates the vapor pressure of a substance at different temperatures to its enthalpy of vaporization. The equation is given by:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -(ΔHvap/R) * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization, and R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K).\n\nIn this problem, we are given the standard boiling point (T1) as 1500 K and the enthalpy of vaporization (ΔHvap) as 40.0 kJ/mol. We need to find the boiling point (T2) at an atmospheric pressure of 1.0 atm (760 mmHg).\n\nAt the boiling point, the vapor pressure of the substance is equal to the atmospheric pressure. Therefore, P1 is the vapor pressure of KCl at 1500 K, and P2 is the vapor pressure at the new boiling point (T2), which is equal to 1.0 atm.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the enthalpy of vaporization to J/mol:\n\nΔHvap = 40.0 kJ/mol * (1000 J/1 kJ) = 40000 J/mol\n\nNext, we need to convert the pressure from atm to Pa:\n\nP2 = 1.0 atm * (101325 Pa/1 atm) = 101325 Pa\n\nSince we don't know the vapor pressure of KCl at 1500 K (P1), we cannot directly solve for T2. However, we can use the fact that the vapor pressure at the boiling point is equal to the atmospheric pressure. Therefore, P1 is also equal to 101325 Pa.\n\nNow we can plug the values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(101325/101325) = -(40000 J/mol / 8.314 J/mol·K) * (1/T2 - 1/1500)\n\n0 = -(40000 / 8.314) * (1/T2 - 1/1500)\n\n0 = (1/T2 - 1/1500)\n\n1/T2 = 1/1500\n\nT2 = 1500 K\n\nThe expected boiling point of KCl at an atmospheric pressure of 1.0 atm (760 mmHg) is 1500 K. This is because the standard boiling point is already given at 1 atm, so the boiling point remains the same at the given pressure."
