    "message_2": "The electronegativity value for hydrogen is 2.1, while for chlorine it is 3.16. The electronegativity difference between hydrogen and chlorine in an HCl molecule is:\n\n3.16 (Cl) - 2.1 (H) = 1.06\n\nSince the electronegativity difference is between 0.5 and 1.7, the bond formed between hydrogen and chlorine in an HCl molecule is a polar covalent bond."
