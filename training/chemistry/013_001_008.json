    "message_2": "The effect of temperature on the adsorption of gases on solid surfaces can be explained using adsorption isotherms, such as the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms, which describe the relationship between the amount of gas adsorbed on a solid surface and the gas pressure at a constant temperature. The strength of the adsorption depends on the nature of the gas, the solid surface, and the temperature.\n\nIn general, adsorption can be classified into two types: physisorption and chemisorption. Physisorption is a physical process where weak van der Waals forces hold the gas molecules on the solid surface. Chemisorption, on the other hand, involves the formation of chemical bonds between the gas molecules and the solid surface.\n\nFor physisorption, the adsorption capacity typically decreases with increasing temperature. This is because physisorption is an exothermic process, meaning that it releases heat. As the temperature increases, the thermal energy of the gas molecules also increases, which can overcome the weak van der Waals forces holding them to the solid surface. As a result, the gas molecules are more likely to desorb from the surface, leading to a decrease in adsorption capacity.\n\nFor chemisorption, the effect of temperature is more complex. At low temperatures, the adsorption capacity may be limited by the activation energy required for the formation of chemical bonds between the gas molecules and the solid surface. In this case, increasing the temperature can increase the adsorption capacity by providing the necessary energy for bond formation. However, at higher temperatures, the adsorption capacity may decrease due to the increased thermal energy of the gas molecules, which can break the chemical bonds and cause desorption.\n\nIn summary, the strength of adsorption of gases on solid surfaces is influenced by temperature. For physisorption, adsorption capacity generally decreases with increasing temperature, while for chemisorption, the relationship between temperature and adsorption capacity is more complex and depends on the activation energy for bond formation and the thermal energy of the gas molecules."
