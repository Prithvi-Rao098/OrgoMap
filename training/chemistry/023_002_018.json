    "message_1": "What is the yield of benzocaine that can be obtained from the reaction of 10 grams of p-aminobenzoic acid with excess ethanol, assuming a perfect reaction and no loss of product during workup?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the yield of benzocaine, we first need to determine the molecular weights of p-aminobenzoic acid and benzocaine. \n\nThe molecular weight of p-aminobenzoic acid (C7H7NO2) is:\nC: 12.01 g/mol * 7 = 84.07 g/mol\nH: 1.01 g/mol * 7 = 7.07 g/mol\nN: 14.01 g/mol * 1 = 14.01 g/mol\nO: 16.00 g/mol * 2 = 32.00 g/mol\nTotal: 84.07 + 7.07 + 14.01 + 32.00 = 137.15 g/mol\n\nThe molecular weight of benzocaine (C9H11NO2) is:\nC: 12.01 g/mol * 9 = 108.09 g/mol\nH: 1.01 g/mol * 11 = 11.11 g/mol\nN: 14.01 g/mol * 1 = 14.01 g/mol\nO: 16.00 g/mol * 2 = 32.00 g/mol\nTotal: 108.09 + 11.11 + 14.01 + 32.00 = 165.21 g/mol\n\nNow, we can use stoichiometry to determine the yield of benzocaine. Since we have excess ethanol, the reaction will be limited by the amount of p-aminobenzoic acid. The stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, meaning one mole of p-aminobenzoic acid will produce one mole of benzocaine.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the 10 grams of p-aminobenzoic acid to moles:\n10 g / 137.15 g/mol = 0.0729 moles\n\nSince the stoichiometry is 1:1, we will also have 0.0729 moles of benzocaine produced. Now, we can convert this back to grams:\n0.0729 moles * 165.21 g/mol = 12.03 g\n\nSo, assuming a perfect reaction and no loss of product during workup, the yield of benzocaine from 10 grams of p-aminobenzoic acid would be approximately 12.03 grams."
