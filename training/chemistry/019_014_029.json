    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the precipitation reaction, we first need to determine the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nBaCl2(aq) + K2SO4(aq) → BaSO4(s) + 2 KCl(aq)\n\nNext, we need to determine the moles of each reactant:\n\nMolar mass of BaCl2 = 137.3 (Ba) + 2 * 35.45 (Cl) = 208.2 g/mol\nMoles of BaCl2 = 50.0 g / 208.2 g/mol = 0.240 mol\n\nMolar mass of K2SO4 = 2 * 39.1 (K) + 32.1 (S) + 4 * 16.0 (O) = 174.3 g/mol\nMoles of K2SO4 = 75.0 g / 174.3 g/mol = 0.430 mol\n\nNow, we need to determine the limiting reactant. The stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1 for BaCl2 and K2SO4, so we can compare the moles of each reactant:\n\n0.240 mol BaCl2 < 0.430 mol K2SO4\n\nBaCl2 is the limiting reactant, and the reaction will produce 0.240 mol of BaSO4 and 0.480 mol of KCl.\n\nNow we can calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction using the heat of formation values:\n\nΔH = [moles of products * heat of formation of products] - [moles of reactants * heat of formation of reactants]\n\nSince the heat of formation for the reactants (BaCl2 and K2SO4) are not given, we will assume that they are in their standard states and their enthalpy of formation is zero. Therefore, the enthalpy change for the reaction will only depend on the products:\n\nΔH = [(0.240 mol * -1474 kJ/mol) + (0.480 mol * -436 kJ/mol)] - [0]\n\nΔH = (-352.8 kJ) + (-209.3 kJ) = -562.1 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the precipitation reaction is -562.1 kJ."
