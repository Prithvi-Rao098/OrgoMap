    "message_2": "To calculate the standard electrode potential for the redox reaction between the half cells Ag/Ag+ and Cu2+/Cu, we need to subtract the standard electrode potential of the half cell with the lower potential from the half cell with the higher potential.\n\nIn this case, the standard electrode potentials are given as:\n\nAg/Ag+ = +0.80 V\nCu2+/Cu = +0.34 V\n\nSince Ag/Ag+ has a higher potential, the redox reaction will proceed as follows:\n\nAg+ + e- → Ag (reduction)\nCu → Cu2+ + 2e- (oxidation)\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard electrode potential for the overall redox reaction:\n\nE°(cell) = E°(cathode) - E°(anode)\n\nE°(cell) = E°(Ag/Ag+) - E°(Cu2+/Cu)\nE°(cell) = (+0.80 V) - (+0.34 V)\nE°(cell) = 0.46 V\n\nThus, the standard electrode potential for the redox reaction between the half cells Ag/Ag+ and Cu2+/Cu at 25°C is 0.46 V."
