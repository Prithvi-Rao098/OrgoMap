    "message_2": "To calculate the change in enthalpy (ΔH) for the combustion of 1 mole of methane gas (CH4) in oxygen gas (O2) at standard conditions, we can use the heat of formation values for each compound involved in the reaction.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation is:\nCH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(l)\n\nThe heat of formation (ΔHf) values for each compound at standard conditions are as follows:\nΔHf [CH4(g)] = -74.8 kJ/mol\nΔHf [O2(g)] = 0 kJ/mol (since it is an element in its standard state)\nΔHf [CO2(g)] = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔHf [H2O(l)] = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can use the following equation to calculate the change in enthalpy (ΔH) for the reaction:\nΔH = Σ ΔHf (products) - Σ ΔHf (reactants)\n\nΔH = [1(-393.5) + 2(-285.8)] - [1(-74.8) + 2(0)]\n\nΔH = (-393.5 - 571.6) - (-74.8)\n\nΔH = -965.1 + 74.8\n\nΔH = -890.3 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the change in enthalpy (ΔH) for the combustion of 1 mole of methane gas (CH4) in oxygen gas (O2) at standard conditions is -890.3 kJ/mol."
