    "message_2": "To use Hess's law, we need to manipulate the given equations so that they can be combined to form the target equation: C(s) + 2H2(g) --> CH4(g). \n\nFirst, we need to reverse equation (2) to get H2(g) and O2(g) on the reactant side:\n\n(2') 2H2(g) + O2(g) --> 2H2O(l)   ΔH₂' = -472 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we need to form CH4(g) in the products. We can do this by adding the following equation:\n\n(4) C(s) + 2H2O(l) --> CH4(g) + O2(g)   ΔH₄ = x kJ/mol\n\nWe can obtain equation (4) by combining equations (1), (2'), and (3). Let's do that:\n\n(1) + (2') + (3) = (4)\n\n2H2(g) + O2(g) --> 2H2O(l)   ΔH₁ = -572 kJ/mol\n2H2(g) + O2(g) --> 2H2O(l)   ΔH₂' = -472 kJ/mol\nC(s) + O2(g) --> CO2(g)   ΔH₃ = -394 kJ/mol\n-----------------------------------------\nC(s) + 2H2O(l) + 2H2(g) + O2(g) --> 2H2O(l) + CO2(g) + CH4(g) + O2(g)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nC(s) + 2H2(g) --> CH4(g) + CO2(g)\n\nNow, we need to subtract equation (3) from the combined equation to get the target equation:\n\n(4) - (3) = Target Equation\n\nC(s) + 2H2(g) --> CH4(g) + CO2(g)   ΔH₄ = x kJ/mol\n- (C(s) + O2(g) --> CO2(g)   ΔH₃ = -394 kJ/mol)\n-----------------------------------------\nC(s) + 2H2(g) --> CH4(g)   ΔH = x + 394 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can find the enthalpy change for the target equation by adding the enthalpy changes of the combined equations:\n\nΔH = ΔH₁ + ΔH₂' + ΔH₃\nΔH = -572 kJ/mol + (-472 kJ/mol) + (-394 kJ/mol)\nΔH = -1438 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the enthalpy change for the target equation is:\n\nΔH = x + 394 kJ/mol\nx = -1438 kJ/mol - 394 kJ/mol\nx = -1832 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy change for the reaction C(s) + 2H2(g) --> CH4(g) is -1832 kJ/mol."
