    "message_2": "The hybridization of the carbon atom in the molecule CH3Cl (methyl chloride) is sp3. This is because the carbon atom is bonded to three hydrogen atoms and one chlorine atom, making a total of four electron domains around the carbon atom. In sp3 hybridization, one s orbital and three p orbitals combine to form four sp3 hybrid orbitals, which are used to form sigma bonds with the surrounding atoms."
