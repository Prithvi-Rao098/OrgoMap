    "message_2": "To determine the toxicity of existing drugs and develop safer versions using medicinal chemistry principles and techniques, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the target: Determine the biological target (e.g., enzyme, receptor, or protein) that the drug interacts with to produce its therapeutic effect. Understanding the target's structure and function can help in designing safer drugs.\n\n2. Analyze structure-activity relationships (SAR): Study the relationship between the chemical structure of the drug and its biological activity. This can help identify the specific functional groups or structural features responsible for the drug's therapeutic effect and toxicity.\n\n3. Determine the mechanism of toxicity: Investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which the drug causes toxicity. This can involve studying the drug's metabolism, its interaction with off-target proteins, or its ability to cause oxidative stress or DNA damage.\n\n4. Design safer analogs: Using the information gathered from SAR analysis and the mechanism of toxicity, design new drug analogs with improved safety profiles. This can involve modifying the drug's chemical structure to reduce its interaction with off-target proteins, improve its metabolic stability, or decrease its potential to cause oxidative stress or DNA damage.\n\n5. In vitro testing: Test the newly designed drug analogs in cell-based assays to evaluate their potency, selectivity, and toxicity. This can help identify promising candidates with improved safety profiles.\n\n6. In vivo testing: Evaluate the safety and efficacy of the promising drug candidates in animal models. This can provide valuable information on the drug's pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and potential toxicities in a whole organism.\n\n7. Optimization: Based on the results of in vitro and in vivo testing, further optimize the drug candidates to improve their safety and efficacy. This can involve additional rounds of chemical modification and testing.\n\n8. Clinical trials: Once a drug candidate with an improved safety profile has been identified and optimized, it can be tested in human clinical trials to evaluate its safety and efficacy in the target patient population.\n\nBy following these steps and employing various medicinal chemistry techniques, such as computational modeling, synthetic chemistry, and biochemical assays, we can determine the toxicity of existing drugs and develop safer versions for therapeutic use."
