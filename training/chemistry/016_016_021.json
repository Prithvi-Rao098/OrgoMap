    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reduction of iron (III) oxide using carbon monoxide as the reducing agent, we first need to write a balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nFe₂O₃ (s) + 3CO (g) → 2Fe (s) + 3CO₂ (g)\n\nNext, we need to use Hess's Law, which states that the enthalpy change of a reaction is the sum of the enthalpy changes of formation of the products minus the sum of the enthalpy changes of formation of the reactants.\n\nΔH = Σ ΔHf (products) - Σ ΔHf (reactants)\n\nWe are given the standard enthalpy of formation for iron (III) oxide (Fe₂O₃) and carbon monoxide (CO). We also need the standard enthalpy of formation for carbon dioxide (CO₂), which is -393.5 kJ/mol. The standard enthalpy of formation for elemental iron (Fe) is 0 kJ/mol since it is in its standard state.\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the equation:\n\nΔH = [2(0) + 3(-393.5)] - [1(-824.2) + 3(-110.5)]\n\nΔH = [-1180.5] - [-824.2 - 331.5]\n\nΔH = [-1180.5] - [-1155.7]\n\nΔH = 24.8 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the reduction of iron (III) oxide using carbon monoxide as the reducing agent is 24.8 kJ/mol."
