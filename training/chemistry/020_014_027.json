    "message_1": "What is the percent ionization of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid (pKa = 4.76) at 25°C, if its ionization constant (Ka) changes to 1.32 x 10^-5 when the temperature is raised to 50°C?",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the ionization constant (Ka) at 25°C using the given pKa value:\n\npKa = -log(Ka)\n4.76 = -log(Ka)\nKa = 10^(-4.76) ≈ 1.74 x 10^-5\n\nNow, we will use the ionization constant (Ka) at 50°C, which is given as 1.32 x 10^-5.\n\nThe ionization reaction for acetic acid (CH3COOH) is:\n\nCH3COOH ⇌ CH3COO- + H+\n\nLet x be the concentration of CH3COO- and H+ ions at equilibrium. Then, the concentration of CH3COOH at equilibrium will be (0.1 - x).\n\nThe ionization constant (Ka) expression is:\n\nKa = [CH3COO-][H+]/[CH3COOH]\n\nAt 50°C, we have:\n\n1.32 x 10^-5 = (x)(x)/(0.1 - x)\n\nWe can assume that x is very small compared to 0.1, so we can approximate:\n\n1.32 x 10^-5 ≈ (x^2)/0.1\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx^2 = 1.32 x 10^-5 * 0.1\nx^2 = 1.32 x 10^-6\nx ≈ 1.15 x 10^-3\n\nNow, we can find the percent ionization:\n\nPercent ionization = (x / initial concentration) * 100\nPercent ionization = (1.15 x 10^-3 / 0.1) * 100\nPercent ionization ≈ 1.15%\n\nSo, the percent ionization of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid at 25°C, if its ionization constant (Ka) changes to 1.32 x 10^-5 when the temperature is raised to 50°C, is approximately 1.15%."
