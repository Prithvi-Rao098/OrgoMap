    "message_2": "To calculate the theoretical yield of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid, we first need to determine the number of moles of benzoic acid and then use stoichiometry to find the number of moles of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid that can be produced. Finally, we will convert the moles of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid to grams.\n\n1. Calculate the number of moles of benzoic acid:\nBenzoic acid has a molecular formula of C7H6O2, and its molar mass is (7 x 12.01) + (6 x 1.01) + (2 x 16.00) = 122.12 g/mol.\n\nNumber of moles of benzoic acid = (mass of benzoic acid) / (molar mass of benzoic acid)\n= 5 g / 122.12 g/mol\n= 0.0409 mol\n\n2. Use stoichiometry to find the number of moles of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid:\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\nC7H6O2 + 2 HNO3 â†’ C7H4N2O6 + 2 H2O\n\nFrom the balanced equation, 1 mole of benzoic acid reacts with 2 moles of nitric acid to produce 1 mole of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid. Therefore, the number of moles of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid produced is equal to the number of moles of benzoic acid.\n\nNumber of moles of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid = 0.0409 mol\n\n3. Convert the moles of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid to grams:\n2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid has a molecular formula of C7H4N2O6, and its molar mass is (7 x 12.01) + (4 x 1.01) + (2 x 14.01) + (6 x 16.00) = 212.14 g/mol.\n\nMass of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid = (number of moles of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid) x (molar mass of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid)\n= 0.0409 mol x 212.14 g/mol\n= 8.67 g\n\nThe theoretical yield of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid that can be obtained from the reaction between 5 grams of benzoic acid and an excess of nitric acid, assuming a 100% reaction efficiency, is 8.67 grams."
