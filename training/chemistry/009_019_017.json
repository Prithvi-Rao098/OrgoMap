    "message_1": "What is the chemical structure of a compound that exhibits a signal at 5.0 ppm in its proton NMR spectrum when dissolved in CDCl3 and shows splitting into a doublet? Provide a complete structural formula of the compound, taking into account any additional information provided by the NMR spectrum.",
    "message_2": "To determine the chemical structure of a compound based on its proton NMR spectrum, we need more information than just the signal at 5.0 ppm and its splitting into a doublet. The NMR spectrum usually provides information about the number of protons, their chemical environment, and their coupling with neighboring protons. \n\nHowever, a signal at 5.0 ppm in a proton NMR spectrum typically indicates the presence of an aldehyde proton (CHO) or an olefinic proton (CH=CH2). The splitting into a doublet suggests that the proton is coupled to another proton. \n\nFor a more accurate and complete structural formula, we would need additional information from the NMR spectrum, such as the number of signals, their integration, and coupling patterns."
