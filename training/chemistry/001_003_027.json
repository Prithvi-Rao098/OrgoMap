    "message_2": "1,2-dichlorocyclopentane has two chiral carbons, which means there can be a maximum of 2^n stereoisomers, where n is the number of chiral centers. In this case, n=2, so there can be a maximum of 2^2 = 4 stereoisomers. However, one of these stereoisomers is a meso compound, which means it has an internal plane of symmetry and is optically inactive. Therefore, there are actually only 3 unique stereoisomers for 1,2-dichlorocyclopentane.\n\nHere are the structures for each stereoisomer:\n\n1. (1R,2R)-1,2-dichlorocyclopentane\n   H       Cl\n    \\     /\n     C1---C2\n    /     \\\n   H       Cl\n\n2. (1S,2S)-1,2-dichlorocyclopentane\n   Cl      H\n    \\     /\n     C1---C2\n    /     \\\n   Cl      H\n\n3. Meso-1,2-dichlorocyclopentane (1R,2S or 1S,2R)\n   H       Cl\n    \\     /\n     C1---C2\n    /     \\\n   Cl      H\n\nIn these structures, C1 and C2 are the chiral centers, and the stereochemistry is indicated by the R and S configurations. The meso compound is the third structure, where the compound has an internal plane of symmetry and is optically inactive."
