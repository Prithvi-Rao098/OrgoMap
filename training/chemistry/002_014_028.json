    "message_2": "To calculate the formal charge of the central atom (sulfur) in SF4, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the number of valence electrons for sulfur (S). Sulfur is in group 16, so it has 6 valence electrons.\n2. Calculate the number of bonding electrons. In SF4, there are 4 single bonds between sulfur and fluorine, so there are 4 x 2 = 8 bonding electrons.\n3. Calculate the number of non-bonding electrons. Subtract the number of bonding electrons from the total valence electrons: 6 (valence electrons) - 8 (bonding electrons) = -2 non-bonding electrons.\n4. Calculate the formal charge. The formula for formal charge is: Formal Charge = Valence Electrons - (Non-bonding Electrons + 1/2 Bonding Electrons). In this case, Formal Charge = 6 - (-2 + 1/2 * 8) = 6 - (0) = 0.\n\nThe formal charge of the central atom (sulfur) in SF4 is 0.\n\nNow, let's check if the molecule is overall neutral or has a partial charge. Fluorine has 7 valence electrons, and each fluorine atom forms a single bond with sulfur. So, the formal charge on each fluorine atom is:\n\nFormal Charge = Valence Electrons - (Non-bonding Electrons + 1/2 Bonding Electrons)\nFormal Charge = 7 - (6 + 1/2 * 2) = 7 - 7 = 0\n\nEach fluorine atom has a formal charge of 0. Since there are 4 fluorine atoms and the sulfur atom also has a formal charge of 0, the overall charge of the SF4 molecule is 0. Therefore, the molecule is overall neutral."
