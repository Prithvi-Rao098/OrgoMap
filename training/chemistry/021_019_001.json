    "message_2": "The solubility of sodium chloride (NaCl) in water varies with temperature. Here are the approximate maximum amounts of NaCl that can dissolve in 100 mL of water at the given temperatures:\n\n1. At 0 °C: Approximately 35.7 grams of NaCl can dissolve in 100 mL of water.\n2. At 25 °C: Approximately 36.0 grams of NaCl can dissolve in 100 mL of water.\n3. At 100 °C: Approximately 39.1 grams of NaCl can dissolve in 100 mL of water.\n\nAs the temperature increases, the solubility of NaCl in water also increases, but not as dramatically as some other salts. This is because the dissolution process of NaCl is endothermic, meaning it absorbs heat from the surroundings. As the temperature increases, the dissolution process becomes more favorable, allowing more NaCl to dissolve in the water. However, the change in solubility with temperature for NaCl is relatively small compared to other salts."
