    "message_2": "According to Le Chatelier's principle, when a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in pressure, the system will adjust itself to counteract the change and re-establish equilibrium. In this case, when the pressure is increased, the reaction will favor the direction that reduces the pressure.\n\nTo determine which direction (forward or reverse) will be favored, we need to consider the number of moles of gas on both sides of the reaction. If the forward reaction produces fewer moles of gas than the reverse reaction, the forward reaction will be favored, as it will help reduce the pressure. Conversely, if the reverse reaction produces fewer moles of gas, the reverse reaction will be favored.\n\nThe rate of collisions between molecules is directly proportional to the pressure in the system. When the pressure is increased, the rate of collisions between molecules also increases. This can lead to a shift in the equilibrium position, as the reaction will favor the direction that helps to decrease the rate of collisions and, consequently, the pressure.\n\nIn summary, when the pressure is increased in a system at equilibrium, the reaction will favor the direction that produces fewer moles of gas, as this will help to counteract the change in pressure and re-establish equilibrium. This can be explained by the concepts of rate of collisions and equilibrium position, as the reaction will shift to decrease the rate of collisions and restore the equilibrium state."
