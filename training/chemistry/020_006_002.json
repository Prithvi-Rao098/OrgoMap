    "message_2": "To determine the effect of temperature change on the equilibrium constant (Kc) of an exothermic reaction, we can use the Van't Hoff equation:\n\nln(K2/K1) = -ΔH/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nWhere:\n- K1 and K2 are the equilibrium constants at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively\n- ΔH is the enthalpy change of the reaction (in J/mol)\n- R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\n- T1 and T2 are the initial and final temperatures in Kelvin (K)\n\nGiven that the reaction is exothermic with a negative ΔH value of -100 kJ/mol, we can convert it to J/mol:\n\nΔH = -100,000 J/mol\n\nLet's assume the initial temperature T1 is 298 K (25°C). The final temperature T2 is increased by 10°C, so T2 = 298 + 10 = 308 K.\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Van't Hoff equation:\n\nln(K2/K1) = -(-100,000 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K) * (1/308 K - 1/298 K)\n\nln(K2/K1) = 100,000 / 8.314 * (0.003247 - 0.003356)\n\nln(K2/K1) = 12,024.4 * (-0.000109)\n\nln(K2/K1) = -1.310\n\nNow, we can solve for K2:\n\nK2 = K1 * e^(-1.310)\n\nSince we don't have the initial equilibrium constant K1, we cannot calculate the exact value of K2. However, we can still analyze the result.\n\nThe negative value of ln(K2/K1) indicates that K2 is smaller than K1. This means that when the temperature is increased by 10°C, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for this exothermic reaction decreases. In other words, the reaction shifts towards the reactants side, favoring the reverse reaction. This is consistent with Le Chatelier's principle, which states that when a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in temperature, the system will adjust to counteract the change and restore equilibrium. In this case, since the reaction is exothermic, increasing the temperature causes the system to shift towards the reactants side to absorb the excess heat."
