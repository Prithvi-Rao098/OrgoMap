    "message_2": "To calculate the pH of the buffer solution, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log ([A-]/[HA])\n\nwhere pH is the pH of the solution, pKa is the negative logarithm of the acid dissociation constant (Ka), [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate ion, CH3COO-), and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid (acetic acid, CH3COOH).\n\nFirst, we need to find the pKa value. The pKa is the negative logarithm of the Ka:\n\npKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.8 x 10^-5) ≈ 4.74\n\nNow, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH of the buffer solution:\n\npH = 4.74 + log ([0.1]/[0.2])\n\npH = 4.74 + log (0.5)\n\npH ≈ 4.74 - 0.3\n\npH ≈ 4.44\n\nSo, the pH of the buffer solution is approximately 4.44."
