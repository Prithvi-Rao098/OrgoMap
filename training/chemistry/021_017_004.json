    "message_2": "In water, there are three types of intermolecular forces present:\n\n1. Hydrogen bonding: This is the strongest intermolecular force in water. It occurs between the partially positive hydrogen atom of one water molecule and the partially negative oxygen atom of another water molecule.\n\n2. Dipole-dipole interactions: These forces occur between the positive and negative ends of polar molecules, such as water. In water, the oxygen atom is more electronegative than the hydrogen atoms, creating a dipole moment.\n\n3. London dispersion forces: These are the weakest intermolecular forces and are present in all molecules, including water. They result from temporary fluctuations in electron distribution around the molecules, which create temporary dipoles that attract other molecules."
