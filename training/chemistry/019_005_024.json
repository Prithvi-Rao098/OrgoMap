    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the reaction at 25°C, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG = Σ(ΔGf_products) - Σ(ΔGf_reactants)\n\nwhere ΔGf represents the standard Gibbs free energy of formation for each species involved in the reaction.\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\n2NO(g) + O2(g) → 2NO2(g)\n\nThe ΔGf values are:\n\nNO(g): +86.4 kJ/mol\nO2(g): 0 kJ/mol\nNO2(g): +51.3 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔG = [2 × (+51.3 kJ/mol)] - [2 × (+86.4 kJ/mol) + 0 kJ/mol]\n\nΔG = (+102.6 kJ) - (+172.8 kJ)\n\nΔG = -70.2 kJ\n\nSo, the Gibbs free energy change for the reaction at 25°C is -70.2 kJ."
