    "message_1": "What is the change in equilibrium constant when the temperature is increased from 298 K to 350 K for the following reaction? \n\n2 NO(g) + O2(g) ⇌ 2 NO2(g) \n\nGiven that the standard enthalpy change (∆H°) for the above reaction is -114.1 kJ/mol and the activation energy for forward and reverse reactions are 83.0 kJ/mol and 253.0 kJ/mol respectively.",
    "message_2": "To find the change in the equilibrium constant (K) when the temperature is increased from 298 K to 350 K, we can use the van 't Hoff equation:\n\nln(K2/K1) = -ΔH°/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere K1 and K2 are the equilibrium constants at temperatures T1 and T2, ΔH° is the standard enthalpy change, and R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K).\n\nGiven:\nΔH° = -114.1 kJ/mol = -114100 J/mol\nT1 = 298 K\nT2 = 350 K\nR = 8.314 J/mol·K\n\nFirst, we need to find the value of ln(K2/K1):\n\nln(K2/K1) = -(-114100 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K) * (1/350 K - 1/298 K)\n\nln(K2/K1) ≈ 6.25\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of K2 to K1:\n\nK2/K1 = e^(6.25) ≈ 520.48\n\nSince we are looking for the change in the equilibrium constant, we can find the difference between K2 and K1:\n\nK2 - K1 = K1 * (K2/K1 - 1)\n\nK2 - K1 = K1 * (520.48 - 1)\n\nThe change in the equilibrium constant is approximately 519.48 times the initial equilibrium constant (K1). Note that we cannot find the exact values of K1 and K2 without more information, but we can determine the change in the equilibrium constant relative to the initial value."
