    "message_2": "In the compound H2SO4, the oxidation state of sulfur can be determined by considering the oxidation states of the other elements in the compound. Hydrogen has an oxidation state of +1, and oxygen has an oxidation state of -2.\n\nThe overall charge of the compound is neutral, so the sum of the oxidation states of all the elements in the compound must equal zero.\n\nLet x be the oxidation state of sulfur. The equation for the sum of the oxidation states is:\n\n2(+1) + x + 4(-2) = 0\n\nSolving for x:\n\n2 + x - 8 = 0\nx - 6 = 0\nx = +6\n\nTherefore, the oxidation state of sulfur in H2SO4 is +6."
