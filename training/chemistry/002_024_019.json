    "message_2": "Copper sulfate (CuSO4) is typically a bright blue color when in its pentahydrate form (CuSO4Â·5H2O), commonly known as blue vitriol or bluestone. The blue color of copper sulfate is due to the presence of the copper (II) ion (Cu2+) in the compound. The copper (II) ion absorbs certain wavelengths of light, particularly in the red region of the visible spectrum, and reflects or transmits the remaining wavelengths, which results in the blue color that we perceive."
