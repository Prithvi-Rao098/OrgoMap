    "message_2": "To prepare 4-bromoacetanilide from acetanilide and bromine, the balanced chemical equation is:\n\nC8H9NO + Br2 â†’ C8H8BrNO + HBr\n\nTo calculate the theoretical yield, we first need to determine the limiting reagent. We will do this by calculating the moles of each reactant and comparing their mole ratios.\n\nFirst, let's find the molar mass of each reactant:\nAcetanilide (C8H9NO): (12.01 * 8) + (1.01 * 9) + 14.01 + 16.00 = 135.17 g/mol\nBromine (Br2): 2 * 79.90 = 159.80 g/mol\n\nNow, let's find the moles of each reactant:\nmoles of acetanilide = 5 g / 135.17 g/mol = 0.0370 mol\nmoles of bromine = (10 mL * 3.12 g/mL) / 159.80 g/mol = 0.195 mol (Note: Bromine has a density of 3.12 g/mL)\n\nNext, let's compare the mole ratios:\nMole ratio of acetanilide to bromine = 0.0370 mol / 0.195 mol = 0.1897\n\nSince the mole ratio is less than 1, acetanilide is the limiting reagent.\n\nNow, let's calculate the theoretical yield of 4-bromoacetanilide:\nMolar mass of 4-bromoacetanilide (C8H8BrNO): (12.01 * 8) + (1.01 * 8) + 79.90 + 14.01 + 16.00 = 214.07 g/mol\n\nTheoretical yield = moles of limiting reagent * molar mass of product\nTheoretical yield = 0.0370 mol * 214.07 g/mol = 7.920 g\n\nSo, the theoretical yield of 4-bromoacetanilide is 7.920 grams."
