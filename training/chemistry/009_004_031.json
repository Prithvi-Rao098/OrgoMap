    "message_2": "To calculate the energy released in the fusion reaction, we need to find the mass difference between the initial reactants (two deuterium nuclei) and the final product (helium nucleus). Then, we can use Einstein's mass-energy equivalence formula (E=mc^2) to find the energy released.\n\n1. Calculate the total mass of the initial reactants (two deuterium nuclei):\nMass of one deuterium nucleus = 2.014102 u\nTotal mass of two deuterium nuclei = 2 × 2.014102 u = 4.028204 u\n\n2. Calculate the mass difference between the initial reactants and the final product (helium nucleus):\nMass difference = Total mass of two deuterium nuclei - Mass of helium nucleus\nMass difference = 4.028204 u - 4.002603 u = 0.025601 u\n\n3. Convert the mass difference from atomic mass units (u) to energy using the conversion factor (1 u = 931.5 MeV/c^2):\nEnergy difference = 0.025601 u × 931.5 MeV/c^2\nEnergy difference ≈ 23.85 MeV\n\n4. Use Einstein's mass-energy equivalence formula (E=mc^2) to find the energy released:\nEnergy released = Energy difference × c^2\nEnergy released ≈ 23.85 MeV\n\nTherefore, the energy released in the fusion reaction between two deuterium nuclei to form a helium nucleus is approximately 23.85 MeV."
