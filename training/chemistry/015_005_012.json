    "message_2": "As an AI language model, I am unable to perform quantum chemistry calculations directly. However, I can provide you with the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of methane using known values from experimental data.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane is:\n\nCH₄(g) + 2O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nUsing standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) at 298 K, we can calculate the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) for this reaction. The standard enthalpies of formation for the compounds involved are:\n\nΔHf°(CH₄) = -74.81 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(CO₂) = -393.51 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(H₂O) = -241.82 kJ/mol (for gaseous water)\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the reaction can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nΔH° = Σ [ΔHf°(products)] - Σ [ΔHf°(reactants)]\n\nΔH° = [1 × (-393.51) + 2 × (-241.82)] - [1 × (-74.81) + 2 × 0]\n\nΔH° = (-393.51 - 483.64) - (-74.81)\n\nΔH° = -802.34 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of methane at 298 K is approximately -802.34 kJ/mol."
