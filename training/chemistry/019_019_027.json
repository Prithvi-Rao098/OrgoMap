    "message_2": "To calculate ΔH°rxn for the reaction N2(g) + 3H2(g) → 2NH3(g), we will use the following equation:\n\nΔH°rxn = Σ ΔH°f(products) - Σ ΔH°f(reactants)\n\nFirst, let's determine the ΔH°f values for the products and reactants:\n\nProducts:\n2 moles of NH3(g): 2 × (-46.1 kJ/mol) = -92.2 kJ\n\nReactants:\n1 mole of N2(g): 1 × 0 kJ/mol = 0 kJ\n3 moles of H2(g): 3 × 0 kJ/mol = 0 kJ\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔH°rxn = (-92.2 kJ) - (0 kJ + 0 kJ)\n\nΔH°rxn = -92.2 kJ\n\nSo, the ΔH°rxn for the reaction N2(g) + 3H2(g) → 2NH3(g) is -92.2 kJ."
