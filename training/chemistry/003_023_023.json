    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 125 grams of water from 25°C to 100°C, we can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat in joules, m is the mass of the substance in grams, c is the specific heat capacity in J/(g·°C), and ΔT is the change in temperature in °C.\n\nGiven:\nm = 125 g\nc = 4.184 J/(g·°C)\nInitial temperature (T1) = 25°C\nFinal temperature (T2) = 100°C\n\nΔT = T2 - T1 = 100°C - 25°C = 75°C\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nq = (125 g) × (4.184 J/(g·°C)) × (75°C)\nq = 125 × 4.184 × 75\nq = 39225 J\n\nTherefore, the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 125 grams of water from 25°C to its boiling point of 100°C is 39,225 joules."
