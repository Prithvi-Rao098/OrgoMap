    "message_1": "A student wants to find the equilibrium constant for the following reaction at a temperature of 298 K:\n2NO(g) + Cl2(g) ⇌ 2NOCl(g)\n\nThe student measures the equilibrium concentrations to be [NO] = 0.050 M, [Cl2] = 0.025 M, and [NOCl] = 0.080 M. What is the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction at this temperature?",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction, we can use the expression:\n\nKc = [NOCl]^2 / ([NO]^2 * [Cl2])\n\nWe are given the equilibrium concentrations as [NO] = 0.050 M, [Cl2] = 0.025 M, and [NOCl] = 0.080 M. Plugging these values into the expression, we get:\n\nKc = (0.080)^2 / ((0.050)^2 * (0.025))\n\nKc = 0.0064 / (0.0025 * 0.025)\n\nKc = 0.0064 / 0.0000625\n\nKc ≈ 102.4\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction at 298 K is approximately 102.4."
