    "message_2": "To determine the anodic Tafel slope for a zinc electrode in contact with a 1M aqueous solution of zinc sulfate, we can use the Tafel equation:\n\nη = b * log10(j/j0)\n\nwhere η is the overpotential (in V), b is the Tafel slope (in V/decade), j is the current density (in A/cm²), and j0 is the exchange current density (in A/cm²).\n\nWe are given the overpotential (η = 30 mV = 0.03 V) and the current density (j = 10 mA/cm² = 0.01 A/cm²). To find the Tafel slope (b), we need to determine the exchange current density (j0) for the zinc electrode in the given conditions.\n\nThe exchange current density (j0) can be found using the following equation:\n\nj0 = A * exp(-ΔG°/RT)\n\nwhere A is the pre-exponential factor, ΔG° is the standard Gibbs free energy change for the reaction, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), and T is the temperature (in K).\n\nFor the zinc electrode in contact with a 1M aqueous solution of zinc sulfate, the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) for the reaction Zn²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Zn is approximately -147 kJ/mol. The temperature is given as 25°C, which is equivalent to 298.15 K.\n\nNow, we can calculate the exchange current density (j0):\n\nj0 = A * exp(-(-147000 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K * 298.15 K))\n\nAssuming a pre-exponential factor (A) of 10^10 A/m², we get:\n\nj0 ≈ 10^10 * exp(147000 / (8.314 * 298.15)) A/m² ≈ 1.3 × 10^-3 A/cm²\n\nNow, we can use the Tafel equation to find the anodic Tafel slope (b):\n\n0.03 V = b * log10(0.01 A/cm² / 1.3 × 10^-3 A/cm²)\n\nb ≈ 0.03 V / log10(0.01 / 1.3 × 10^-3) ≈ 0.03 V / 1.98 ≈ 0.015 V/decade\n\nThe anodic Tafel slope for the zinc electrode in contact with a 1M aqueous solution of zinc sulfate under the given conditions is approximately 0.015 V/decade."
