    "message_1": "A chemistry student performed a reaction that produced 2.0 grams of product. The theoretical yield for this reaction is 2.5 grams. Calculate the percent yield for this reaction.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the percent yield for this reaction, you can use the following formula:\n\nPercent Yield = (Actual Yield / Theoretical Yield) x 100\n\nIn this case, the actual yield is 2.0 grams, and the theoretical yield is 2.5 grams. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nPercent Yield = (2.0 grams / 2.5 grams) x 100\n\nPercent Yield = 0.8 x 100\n\nPercent Yield = 80%\n\nSo, the percent yield for this reaction is 80%."
