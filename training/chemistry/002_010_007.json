    "message_2": "To calculate the density of the sodium chloride (NaCl) sample, we use the formula:\n\nDensity = Mass / Volume\n\nGiven the mass of the sample is 5.0 grams and the volume is 2.0 mL, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nDensity = (5.0 grams) / (2.0 mL)\n\nDensity = 2.5 grams/mL\n\nSo, the density of the sodium chloride sample is 2.5 grams/mL."
