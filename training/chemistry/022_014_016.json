    "message_2": "To determine the limiting reactant and the amount of magnesium oxide that can be produced, we need to use the stoichiometry of the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\n2 Mg (s) + O₂ (g) → 2 MgO (s)\n\nFirst, we need to find the molar mass of magnesium (Mg) and oxygen (O₂).\n\nMolar mass of Mg = 24.31 g/mol\nMolar mass of O₂ = 2 × 16.00 g/mol = 32.00 g/mol\n\nNow, we'll convert the given masses of Mg and O₂ to moles.\n\nMoles of Mg = (10 g) / (24.31 g/mol) = 0.411 moles\nMoles of O₂ = (15 g) / (32.00 g/mol) = 0.469 moles\n\nNext, we'll determine the mole ratio of Mg to O₂ in the balanced chemical equation:\n\nMole ratio (Mg:O₂) = 2:1\n\nNow, we'll compare the mole ratio of the given reactants to the balanced chemical equation:\n\nMole ratio of given reactants (Mg:O₂) = (0.411 moles) / (0.469 moles) = 0.876\n\nSince the mole ratio of the given reactants (0.876) is greater than the mole ratio in the balanced chemical equation (2:1 = 0.5), this means that magnesium (Mg) is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow, we'll find out how much magnesium oxide (MgO) can be produced using the limiting reactant (Mg). We'll use the stoichiometry of the balanced chemical equation:\n\n2 moles of Mg → 2 moles of MgO\n\n0.411 moles of Mg → x moles of MgO\n\nx = (0.411 moles of Mg) × (2 moles of MgO / 2 moles of Mg) = 0.411 moles of MgO\n\nNow, we'll convert moles of MgO to grams:\n\nMass of MgO = (0.411 moles) × (40.31 g/mol) = 16.55 g\n\nTherefore, the limiting reactant is magnesium (Mg), and 16.55 grams of magnesium oxide (MgO) can be produced."
