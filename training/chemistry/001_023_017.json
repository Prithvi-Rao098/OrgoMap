    "message_2": "When synthesizing a peptide chain consisting of both acidic and basic amino acid residues, the most efficient protecting group strategy would involve using orthogonal protecting groups. Orthogonal protecting groups can be selectively removed under different conditions without affecting other protecting groups in the peptide chain.\n\nFor the N-terminus of amino acids, the most common protecting group is the tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) group, which can be selectively removed under acidic conditions without affecting side-chain protecting groups.\n\nFor the side chains of acidic amino acids (aspartic and glutamic acids), the benzyl ester (OBn) or the tert-butyl ester (OtBu) protecting groups are commonly used. These groups can be selectively removed using hydrogenolysis or trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), respectively.\n\nFor the side chains of basic amino acids (lysine, arginine, and histidine), the following protecting groups are commonly used:\n\n1. Lysine: 2-chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz or Z), 4-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl (Mebz), or tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) groups.\n2. Arginine: Nitrophenylsulfenyl (Nps), p-toluenesulfonyl (Tos), or 2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl (Pbf) groups.\n3. Histidine: Trityl (Trt) or benzyl (Bn) groups.\n\nThese protecting groups can be selectively removed under different conditions, allowing for the efficient synthesis of the peptide chain with both acidic and basic amino acid residues."
