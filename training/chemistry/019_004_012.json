    "message_2": "To calculate the entropy change for the combustion of methane gas, we need the standard molar entropies of all the reactants and products involved in the reaction. The balanced chemical equation is:\n\nCH4 (g) + 2O2 (g) -> CO2 (g) + 2H2O (g)\n\nWe are given the standard molar entropy of CH4 as 186.25 J/(mol·K). We also need the standard molar entropies of O2, CO2, and H2O. The standard molar entropies for these substances are:\n\nO2 (g): 205.15 J/(mol·K)\nCO2 (g): 213.79 J/(mol·K)\nH2O (g): 188.84 J/(mol·K)\n\nNow, we can calculate the entropy change (ΔS) for the reaction using the following formula:\n\nΔS = ΣnS(products) - ΣnS(reactants)\n\nwhere n is the stoichiometric coefficient and S is the standard molar entropy.\n\nΔS = [(1 × 213.79) + (2 × 188.84)] - [(1 × 186.25) + (2 × 205.15)]\n\nΔS = (213.79 + 377.68) - (186.25 + 410.30)\n\nΔS = 591.47 - 596.55\n\nΔS = -5.08 J/(mol·K)\n\nThe entropy change for the combustion of methane gas at a constant temperature of 298 K and a pressure of 1 atm is -5.08 J/(mol·K)."
