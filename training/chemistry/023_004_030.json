    "message_2": "To determine the maximum yield of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) that can be obtained from 3.00 grams of salicylic acid (SA) and excess acetic anhydride, we need to perform a stoichiometric calculation.\n\nFirst, let's find the molar mass of salicylic acid and acetylsalicylic acid:\nSA: C7H6O3 = (7 × 12.01) + (6 × 1.01) + (3 × 16.00) = 138.12 g/mol\nASA: C9H8O4 = (9 × 12.01) + (8 × 1.01) + (4 × 16.00) = 180.16 g/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the moles of salicylic acid:\nmoles of SA = mass of SA / molar mass of SA = 3.00 g / 138.12 g/mol = 0.0217 mol\n\nSince the reaction between salicylic acid and acetic anhydride is a 1:1 stoichiometry, the moles of ASA produced will be the same as the moles of SA used:\nmoles of ASA = 0.0217 mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the mass of ASA produced:\nmass of ASA = moles of ASA × molar mass of ASA = 0.0217 mol × 180.16 g/mol = 3.91 g\n\nHowever, the final product is purified by recrystallization, which typically results in some loss of product. The actual yield will depend on the efficiency of the recrystallization process, which can vary. Assuming a reasonable recrystallization efficiency of 90%, the maximum yield of ASA would be:\n\nmaximum yield of ASA = 3.91 g × 0.90 = 3.52 g\n\nSo, the maximum yield of acetylsalicylic acid that can be obtained from 3.00 grams of salicylic acid and excess acetic anhydride under the given conditions is approximately 3.52 grams."
