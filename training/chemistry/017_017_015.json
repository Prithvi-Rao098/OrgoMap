    "message_2": "The photochemical properties of metal complexes are influenced by the metal's oxidation state and the ligand set surrounding the metal center. These factors can affect the absorption and emission properties, as well as the photochemical reactivity of the complex. The oxidation state of the metal can influence the energy levels of the metal-based orbitals, while the ligand set can affect the energy levels of the ligand-based orbitals and the overall geometry of the complex.\n\nExample 1: Tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) complex ([Ru(bpy)3]2+)\nIn this complex, the ruthenium metal center is in the +2 oxidation state, and the ligand set consists of three bipyridine (bpy) ligands. The photochemical properties of this complex are characterized by strong absorption in the visible region (around 450 nm) and luminescence in the red region (around 620 nm). The absorption is attributed to metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transitions, where an electron is promoted from a metal-based orbital to a ligand-based orbital. Upon excitation, the complex undergoes a relatively long-lived excited state, which can participate in various photochemical reactions, such as electron transfer and energy transfer processes.\n\nExample 2: Tetrachloroplatinate(II) complex ([PtCl4]2-)\nIn this complex, the platinum metal center is in the +2 oxidation state, and the ligand set consists of four chloride ligands. The photochemical properties of this complex are characterized by weak absorption in the visible region (around 400 nm) and no significant luminescence. The absorption is attributed to ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) transitions, where an electron is promoted from a ligand-based orbital to a metal-based orbital. Due to the strong bonding between the metal and the ligands, the excited state is short-lived, and the complex is generally not very reactive in photochemical processes.\n\nIn summary, the photochemical properties of metal complexes can vary significantly depending on the metal's oxidation state and ligand set. In the examples provided, the [Ru(bpy)3]2+ complex exhibits strong absorption and luminescence due to MLCT transitions, while the [PtCl4]2- complex shows weak absorption and no luminescence due to LMCT transitions. The different photochemical reactivities of these complexes can be attributed to the nature of the excited states and the bonding interactions between the metal center and the ligands."
