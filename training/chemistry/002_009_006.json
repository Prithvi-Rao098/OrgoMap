    "message_2": "To find the empirical formula of a compound, we need to determine the mole ratio of the elements present in the compound. Here, we have magnesium (Mg) and chlorine (Cl).\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of each element:\n\n1. Moles of magnesium (Mg):\nMolar mass of Mg = 24.31 g/mol\nMoles of Mg = mass of Mg / molar mass of Mg\nMoles of Mg = 3.77 g / 24.31 g/mol = 0.155 mol\n\n2. Moles of chlorine (Cl):\nMolar mass of Cl = 35.45 g/mol\nMoles of Cl = mass of Cl / molar mass of Cl\nMoles of Cl = 4.37 g / 35.45 g/mol = 0.123 mol\n\nNow, we need to find the mole ratio of Mg to Cl:\n\nMole ratio = moles of Mg / moles of Cl\nMole ratio = 0.155 mol / 0.123 mol = 1.26\n\nSince the mole ratio is close to 1:1, we can round it to the nearest whole number, which is 1:1.\n\nTherefore, the empirical formula of the compound is MgCl."
