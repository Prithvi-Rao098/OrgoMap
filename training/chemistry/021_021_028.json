    "message_2": "In the molecule of formaldehyde (H2CO), the central atom is carbon. The carbon atom forms two sigma bonds with two hydrogen atoms and one sigma bond with an oxygen atom, as well as a pi bond with the oxygen atom. To accommodate these bonds, the carbon atom undergoes sp2 hybridization, which involves the mixing of one s orbital and two p orbitals to form three sp2 hybrid orbitals. These sp2 hybrid orbitals are used to form sigma bonds with the hydrogen and oxygen atoms. The remaining unhybridized p orbital on the carbon atom forms a pi bond with the oxygen atom."
