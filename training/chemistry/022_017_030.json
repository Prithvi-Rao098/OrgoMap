The enthalpy of combustion of ethanol was found to be -1367 kJ/mol and the enthalpy of combustion of propane was found to be -2220 kJ/mol. Use Hess's Law to calculate the enthalpy of formation of propane, given that the enthalpy of formation of ethanol is -277 kJ/mol.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use Hess's Law, which states that the enthalpy change of a reaction is the same whether it occurs in one step or several steps. We can use the enthalpy of combustion of ethanol and propane, as well as the enthalpy of formation of ethanol, to find the enthalpy of formation of propane.\n\nFirst, let's write down the combustion reactions for ethanol and propane:\n\n1. Ethanol combustion: C2H5OH (l) + 3 O2 (g) → 2 CO2 (g) + 3 H2O (l)\nΔH_combustion_ethanol = -1367 kJ/mol\n\n2. Propane combustion: C3H8 (g) + 5 O2 (g) → 3 CO2 (g) + 4 H2O (l)\nΔH_combustion_propane = -2220 kJ/mol\n\nNow, let's write down the formation reaction for ethanol and propane:\n\n3. Ethanol formation: 2 C (s) + 3 H2 (g) + 1/2 O2 (g) → C2H5OH (l)\nΔH_formation_ethanol = -277 kJ/mol\n\n4. Propane formation: 3 C (s) + 4 H2 (g) → C3H8 (g)\nΔH_formation_propane = ?\n\nWe can use Hess's Law to find the enthalpy of formation of propane. We need to manipulate the given reactions to get the propane formation reaction. We can do this by reversing the ethanol formation reaction and adding it to the propane combustion reaction, then subtracting the ethanol combustion reaction.\n\nReversed ethanol formation reaction:\nC2H5OH (l) → 2 C (s) + 3 H2 (g) + 1/2 O2 (g)\nΔH = +277 kJ/mol\n\nNow, let's add the reversed ethanol formation reaction to the propane combustion reaction:\n\nC2H5OH (l) + C3H8 (g) + 5 O2 (g) → 2 C (s) + 3 H2 (g) + 1/2 O2 (g) + 3 CO2 (g) + 4 H2O (l)\nΔH = +277 kJ/mol - 2220 kJ/mol = -1943 kJ/mol\n\nFinally, let's subtract the ethanol combustion reaction:\n\nC3H8 (g) + 5 O2 (g) → 3 C (s) + 4 H2 (g) + 3 CO2 (g) + 4 H2O (l)\nΔH = -1943 kJ/mol + 1367 kJ/mol = -576 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the enthalpy of formation of propane (ΔH_formation_propane) is -576 kJ/mol."
