Here's a precise problem for a chemistry student to solve on Activation energy calculations:\n\n\"A reaction between hydrogen and iodine gas has an activation energy of 156 kJ/mol. If the rate constant of the reaction is 2.37 x 10^-4 s^-1 at 25°C, what will be the rate constant at 50°C? Assume the activation energy and pre-exponential factor are temperature independent.\"",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Arrhenius equation, which relates the rate constant (k) of a reaction to its activation energy (Ea) and temperature (T):\n\nk = A * exp(-Ea / (R * T))\n\nwhere A is the pre-exponential factor, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nWe are given the rate constant (k1) at 25°C (298.15 K) and asked to find the rate constant (k2) at 50°C (323.15 K). We can set up a ratio using the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk2 / k1 = exp((-Ea / (R * T2)) - (-Ea / (R * T1)))\n\nWe know the values for k1, Ea, R, T1, and T2:\n\nk1 = 2.37 x 10^-4 s^-1\nEa = 156 kJ/mol = 156,000 J/mol\nR = 8.314 J/mol·K\nT1 = 298.15 K\nT2 = 323.15 K\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n\nk2 / (2.37 x 10^-4 s^-1) = exp((-156,000 J/mol / (8.314 J/mol·K * 323.15 K)) - (-156,000 J/mol / (8.314 J/mol·K * 298.15 K)))\n\nSolving for k2:\n\nk2 = (2.37 x 10^-4 s^-1) * exp((-156,000 J/mol / (8.314 J/mol·K * 323.15 K)) - (-156,000 J/mol / (8.314 J/mol·K * 298.15 K)))\nk2 ≈ 6.63 x 10^-4 s^-1\n\nSo, the rate constant at 50°C (323.15 K) is approximately 6.63 x 10^-4 s^-1."
