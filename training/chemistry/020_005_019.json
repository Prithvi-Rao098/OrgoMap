    "message_1": "What is the effect on the equilibrium position of the following reaction when more water is added to the system: \n\n2H2(g) + O2(g) â‡Œ 2H2O(g) \n\nWill the concentration of the reactants or the products increase or decrease as a result? How can Le Chatelier's principle be applied to explain the observed changes in the equilibrium position?",
    "message_2": "When more water (H2O) is added to the system, the equilibrium position will shift to counteract the change, according to Le Chatelier's principle. In this case, the equilibrium will shift to the left, favoring the formation of reactants (H2 and O2).\n\nLe Chatelier's principle states that if a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in concentration, temperature, or pressure, the system will adjust its equilibrium position to counteract the change. In this case, by adding more H2O to the system, you are increasing the concentration of the product. To counteract this change, the system will shift the equilibrium position to decrease the concentration of H2O by converting it back into H2 and O2.\n\nAs a result, the concentration of the reactants (H2 and O2) will increase, while the concentration of the product (H2O) will decrease until a new equilibrium position is established."
