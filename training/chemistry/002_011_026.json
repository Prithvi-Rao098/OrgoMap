    "message_2": "The molecular geometry of carbon dioxide (CO2) is linear. In this molecule, the central carbon atom is double-bonded to two oxygen atoms. The bond angle between the oxygen atoms is 180 degrees.\n\nRegarding polarity, CO2 is a nonpolar molecule. Although the carbon-oxygen bonds are polar due to the difference in electronegativity between carbon and oxygen, the linear geometry causes the dipole moments of the two C=O bonds to cancel each other out, resulting in an overall nonpolar molecule."
