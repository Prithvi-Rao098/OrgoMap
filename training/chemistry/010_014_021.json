    "message_1": "What mass of copper will be deposited when 2.5 A of current is passed through a CuSO4(aq) solution for 25 minutes? (Assume that the current efficiency is 100% and the molar mass of copper to be 63.5 g/mol.)",
    "message_2": "To find the mass of copper deposited, we can use Faraday's law of electrolysis. Faraday's law states that the mass of a substance deposited or dissolved at an electrode is directly proportional to the quantity of electricity passed through the electrolyte.\n\nFirst, we need to find the charge passed through the electrolyte. Charge (Q) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nQ = I × t\n\nwhere I is the current (in amperes) and t is the time (in seconds).\n\nGiven, current (I) = 2.5 A and time (t) = 25 minutes = 25 × 60 = 1500 seconds.\n\nNow, let's calculate the charge:\n\nQ = 2.5 A × 1500 s = 3750 Coulombs\n\nNext, we need to find the number of moles of electrons passed through the electrolyte. We can use the formula:\n\nn = Q / F\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of electrons, Q is the charge (in Coulombs), and F is Faraday's constant (approximately 96485 C/mol).\n\nn = 3750 C / 96485 C/mol ≈ 0.0388 mol\n\nThe balanced half-reaction for the reduction of Cu^2+ ions to Cu metal is:\n\nCu^2+ + 2e^- → Cu\n\nFrom the stoichiometry of the reaction, 2 moles of electrons are required to deposit 1 mole of copper. So, we can find the number of moles of copper deposited (n_Cu) using the formula:\n\nn_Cu = n / 2\n\nn_Cu = 0.0388 mol / 2 ≈ 0.0194 mol\n\nFinally, we can find the mass of copper deposited (m_Cu) using the formula:\n\nm_Cu = n_Cu × M_Cu\n\nwhere M_Cu is the molar mass of copper (63.5 g/mol).\n\nm_Cu = 0.0194 mol × 63.5 g/mol ≈ 1.23 g\n\nTherefore, the mass of copper deposited is approximately 1.23 grams."
