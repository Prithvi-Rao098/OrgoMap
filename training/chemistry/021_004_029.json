    "message_2": "In the compound CHCl3 (chloroform), the central atom is carbon. To determine the hybridization of the central carbon atom, we need to consider its electron domains.\n\nCarbon has 4 valence electrons, and it forms one bond with hydrogen and three bonds with chlorine atoms. This gives carbon a total of four electron domains (one for each bond). \n\nAccording to the VSEPR theory, when a central atom has four electron domains, it adopts a tetrahedral geometry, and the hybridization of the central atom is sp3. \n\nSo, the hybridization of the central carbon atom in CHCl3 is sp3."
