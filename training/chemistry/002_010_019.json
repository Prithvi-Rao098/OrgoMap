    "message_2": "To find the density of the solution, we can use the formula:\n\nDensity = mass/volume\n\nWe are given the mass of sodium chloride (25.0 g) and the volume of the solution (25.0 mL). \n\nFirst, we need to convert the volume from mL to L:\n\n25.0 mL * (1 L / 1000 mL) = 0.025 L\n\nNow, we can find the density:\n\nDensity = (25.0 g) / (0.025 L) = 1000 g/L\n\nThe density of the 25.0 mL solution containing 25.0 g of sodium chloride is 1000 g/L."
