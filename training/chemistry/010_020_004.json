    "message_2": "To calculate the corrosion rate of iron in a galvanic couple with copper, we need to determine the mass loss rate of iron due to the galvanic corrosion. The corrosion rate can be calculated using Faraday's Law of Electrolysis:\n\nCorrosion rate = (i × A × M) / (n × F)\n\nwhere:\n- i is the current density (0.6 mA/cm²)\n- A is the area of the iron electrode (8 cm²)\n- M is the molar mass of iron (55.85 g/mol)\n- n is the number of electrons involved in the redox reaction (2 for iron, as it forms Fe²⁺ ions)\n- F is Faraday's constant (96,485 C/mol)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the current density from mA/cm² to A/cm²:\n\n0.6 mA/cm² = 0.6 × 10⁻³ A/cm² = 0.0006 A/cm²\n\nNow we can calculate the corrosion rate:\n\nCorrosion rate = (0.0006 A/cm² × 8 cm² × 55.85 g/mol) / (2 × 96,485 C/mol)\n\nCorrosion rate = (0.02664 g/mol) / (192,970 C/mol)\n\nCorrosion rate = 1.38 × 10⁻⁴ g/C\n\nTo find the corrosion rate in terms of mass loss per unit time, we need to multiply the corrosion rate by the total current (i × A):\n\nTotal current = 0.0006 A/cm² × 8 cm² = 0.0048 A\n\nMass loss rate = 1.38 × 10⁻⁴ g/C × 0.0048 A\n\nMass loss rate = 6.62 × 10⁻⁷ g/s\n\nThe corrosion rate of iron in the galvanic couple with copper is approximately 6.62 × 10⁻⁷ g/s."
