The heat capacity of the calorimeter is 25 J/°C, and the heat capacity of water is 4.184 J/g°C. The molar heat of fusion for sodium acetate trihydrate is 29.4 kJ/mol.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to calculate the moles of sodium acetate trihydrate in 50 grams. The molar mass of sodium acetate trihydrate is:\n\nNa: 22.99 g/mol\nC: 2 * 12.01 g/mol\nH: (3 * 1.01 g/mol) + (6 * 1.01 g/mol)\nO: (2 * 16.00 g/mol) + (3 * 16.00 g/mol)\n\nMolar mass = 22.99 + 24.02 + 9.09 + 80.00 = 136.10 g/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the moles of sodium acetate trihydrate:\n\nmoles = mass / molar mass = 50 g / 136.10 g/mol = 0.367 moles\n\nNext, we need to calculate the heat released when the solution cools from 90°C to 25°C. The heat capacity of the solution can be approximated as the heat capacity of water:\n\nq_cooling = mass * heat capacity * ΔT = 50 g * 4.184 J/g°C * (25°C - 90°C) = -13,684 J\n\nNow, we need to calculate the heat released during the crystallization process:\n\nq_crystallization = moles * molar heat of fusion = 0.367 moles * 29.4 kJ/mol = 10.79 kJ = 10,790 J\n\nFinally, we need to account for the heat absorbed by the calorimeter:\n\nq_calorimeter = heat capacity * ΔT = 25 J/°C * (25°C - 90°C) = -1,625 J\n\nThe total heat released during the cooling and crystallization process is the sum of the heat released during cooling, crystallization, and the heat absorbed by the calorimeter:\n\nq_total = q_cooling + q_crystallization + q_calorimeter = -13,684 J + 10,790 J - 1,625 J = -4,519 J\n\nTherefore, the heat of crystallization of 50 grams of sodium acetate trihydrate is -4,519 J."
