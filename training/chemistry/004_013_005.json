    "message_1": "How many moles of copper (Cu) are present in a sample weighing 0.250 g when 10.0 coulombs of electricity is passed through it during the coulometric titration process? The electrode used was a copper electrode, and the atomic weight of copper is 63.55 g/mol.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to determine the number of moles of electrons transferred during the coulometric titration process. The relationship between charge (coulombs) and moles of electrons can be described by Faraday's constant (F), which is approximately 96,485 C/mol.\n\nGiven that 10.0 coulombs of electricity were passed through the sample, we can calculate the moles of electrons (n) as follows:\n\nn = charge (coulombs) / Faraday's constant (C/mol)\nn = 10.0 C / 96,485 C/mol\nn ≈ 0.0001036 mol of electrons\n\nNow, we need to determine the stoichiometry of the reaction between copper and electrons. The balanced half-reaction for the reduction of copper ions to copper metal is:\n\nCu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu\n\nFrom the stoichiometry of the reaction, we can see that 2 moles of electrons are required to reduce 1 mole of copper ions to copper metal. Therefore, we can calculate the moles of copper (Cu) reduced in the sample:\n\nmoles of Cu = moles of electrons / 2\nmoles of Cu ≈ 0.0001036 mol / 2\nmoles of Cu ≈ 0.0000518 mol\n\nNow, we can use the mass of the sample (0.250 g) and the atomic weight of copper (63.55 g/mol) to calculate the moles of copper present in the sample:\n\nmoles of Cu = mass of Cu / atomic weight of Cu\nmoles of Cu = 0.250 g / 63.55 g/mol\nmoles of Cu ≈ 0.003934 mol\n\nFinally, we can compare the moles of copper reduced (0.0000518 mol) to the total moles of copper in the sample (0.003934 mol) to determine the proportion of copper present:\n\nProportion of copper = (moles of Cu reduced) / (total moles of Cu)\nProportion of copper ≈ 0.0000518 mol / 0.003934 mol\nProportion of copper ≈ 0.0132\n\nThus, approximately 1.32% of the copper in the sample was present when 10.0 coulombs of electricity were passed through it during the coulometric titration process."
