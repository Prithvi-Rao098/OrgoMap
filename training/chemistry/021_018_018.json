    "message_2": "The boiling point of a substance depends on the strength of its intermolecular forces. A substance with only London dispersion forces as its intermolecular force will generally have a lower boiling point compared to a substance that has both London dispersion and dipole-dipole forces.\n\nLondon dispersion forces are the weakest type of intermolecular forces, resulting from temporary dipoles created by the movement of electrons. These forces are present in all molecules, but are particularly significant in nonpolar molecules.\n\nDipole-dipole forces are stronger intermolecular forces that occur between polar molecules, where there is a permanent separation of charges due to differences in electronegativity between atoms within the molecule.\n\nSince dipole-dipole forces are stronger than London dispersion forces, a substance with both types of forces will have stronger overall intermolecular forces, leading to a higher boiling point. However, it is important to note that the boiling point also depends on other factors such as molecular size and shape, so it is not possible to provide a specific boiling point value without more information about the substances in question."
