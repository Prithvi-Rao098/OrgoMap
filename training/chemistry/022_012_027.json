    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of molarity and the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid:\n\nNaOH + HCl → NaCl + H2O\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that one mole of NaOH reacts with one mole of HCl. We can use the formula:\n\nmoles of HCl = moles of NaOH\n\nWe are given the volume and molarity of HCl, so we can calculate the moles of HCl:\n\nmoles of HCl = Molarity of HCl × Volume of HCl\nmoles of HCl = 0.15 M × 0.025 L (converting 25 mL to liters)\nmoles of HCl = 0.00375 moles\n\nNow we can find the volume of 0.1 M NaOH solution required to neutralize the HCl:\n\nmoles of NaOH = moles of HCl\nmoles of NaOH = 0.00375 moles\n\nVolume of NaOH = moles of NaOH / Molarity of NaOH\nVolume of NaOH = 0.00375 moles / 0.1 M\nVolume of NaOH = 0.0375 L\n\nTo convert the volume to milliliters, multiply by 1000:\n\nVolume of NaOH = 0.0375 L × 1000\nVolume of NaOH = 37.5 mL\n\nSo, 37.5 mL of 0.1 M sodium hydroxide is required to neutralize 25 mL of 0.15 M hydrochloric acid."
