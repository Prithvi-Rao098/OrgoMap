    "message_2": "The maximum theoretical yield of aspirin can be calculated using stoichiometry. The balanced chemical equation for the synthesis of aspirin is:\n\nC7H6O3 (salicylic acid) + C4H6O3 (acetic anhydride) → C9H8O4 (aspirin) + C2H4O2 (acetic acid)\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of salicylic acid reacts with 1 mole of acetic anhydride to produce 1 mole of aspirin. To calculate the maximum theoretical yield, we need to know the amount (in moles) of each reactant.\n\nLet's assume we have 1 mole of salicylic acid (138.12 g) and 1 mole of acetic anhydride (102.09 g). Since the reaction is a 1:1 ratio, the limiting reactant is the one with the least amount of moles. In this case, both reactants have the same amount of moles, so neither is limiting.\n\nNow, we can calculate the maximum theoretical yield of aspirin:\n\n1 mole of salicylic acid × (1 mole of aspirin / 1 mole of salicylic acid) × (180.16 g of aspirin / 1 mole of aspirin) = 180.16 g of aspirin\n\nSo, the maximum theoretical yield of aspirin is 180.16 g.\n\nHowever, the actual yield of aspirin is often less than the theoretical yield due to several factors, including the presence of impurities. Impurities can affect the actual yield in several ways:\n\n1. Impurities can react with the reactants, reducing their concentration and thus decreasing the amount of aspirin produced.\n2. Impurities can cause side reactions, leading to the formation of unwanted byproducts that reduce the yield of aspirin.\n3. Impurities can lower the efficiency of the reaction by affecting the reaction rate or equilibrium.\n\nIn practice, chemists often use purification techniques to minimize the impact of impurities on the actual yield. However, it is rare to achieve a 100% yield in a chemical reaction due to various factors, including the presence of impurities."
