    "message_2": "In a double replacement reaction, the cations and anions of the two reactants switch places to form two new compounds. In this case, silver nitrate (AgNO3) and sodium chloride (NaCl) will react to form silver chloride (AgCl) and sodium nitrate (NaNO3). The balanced equation for this reaction is:\n\nAgNO3(aq) + NaCl(aq) â†’ AgCl(s) + NaNO3(aq)"
