Calculate the percent yield of phenylalanine if 3 grams of benzyl chloride was reacted with 2 grams of ammonia.",
    "message_2": "The preparation of phenylalanine from benzyl chloride and ammonia involves two main steps: the formation of benzylamine and then the reaction with a suitable α-keto acid to form phenylalanine. The first step is the reaction between benzyl chloride and ammonia to form benzylamine:\n\nC6H5CH2Cl + NH3 → C6H5CH2NH2 + HCl\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the second step, the reaction between benzylamine and pyruvic acid to form phenylalanine, is:\n\nC6H5CH2NH2 + CH3COCOOH → C6H5CH2CH(NH2)COOH + CH3OH\n\nIf an excess of ammonia is used, the reaction would favor the formation of benzylamine, as the excess ammonia would drive the reaction to completion. However, the excess ammonia would not affect the second step of the reaction, as it does not participate in the reaction with pyruvic acid.\n\nTo calculate the percent yield of phenylalanine, first, determine the limiting reagent:\n\nMolar mass of benzyl chloride (C6H5CH2Cl) = 126.59 g/mol\nMoles of benzyl chloride = 3 g / 126.59 g/mol = 0.0237 mol\n\nMolar mass of ammonia (NH3) = 17.03 g/mol\nMoles of ammonia = 2 g / 17.03 g/mol = 0.1175 mol\n\nThe mole ratio of benzyl chloride to ammonia in the balanced equation is 1:1. Since there are fewer moles of benzyl chloride, it is the limiting reagent.\n\nNow, calculate the theoretical yield of phenylalanine:\n\nMolar mass of phenylalanine (C6H5CH2CH(NH2)COOH) = 165.19 g/mol\nTheoretical yield = 0.0237 mol * 165.19 g/mol = 3.91 g\n\nAssuming you have the actual yield of phenylalanine from the reaction, you can calculate the percent yield:\n\nPercent yield = (actual yield / theoretical yield) * 100\n\nFor example, if the actual yield was 2.5 grams of phenylalanine:\n\nPercent yield = (2.5 g / 3.91 g) * 100 = 63.93%"
