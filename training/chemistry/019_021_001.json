    "message_2": "First, we need to determine the number of moles of magnesium oxide (MgO) in the given mass:\n\nmoles of MgO = mass / molar mass\nmoles of MgO = 4.50 g / 40.31 g/mol\nmoles of MgO = 0.1117 mol\n\nNow, we can use the stoichiometry of the reaction and the given standard enthalpy change to calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction with 0.1117 mol of MgO:\n\nΔH = -120.3 kJ/mol × 0.1117 mol\nΔH = -13.43 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the reaction with 4.50 grams of magnesium oxide and excess hydrochloric acid is -13.43 kJ (rounded to two decimal places)."
