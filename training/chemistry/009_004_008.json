    "message_2": "The minimum temperature required to initiate nuclear fusion between two deuterium nuclei is approximately 15 million Kelvin (15 x 10^6 K) or 27 million degrees Fahrenheit. This high temperature is necessary to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged nuclei and allow them to come close enough for the strong nuclear force to bind them together."
