    "message_1": "What is the chemical structure of an unknown organic compound that has been analyzed using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and what functional groups are present in the compound?",
    "message_2": "As an AI, I cannot directly analyze the magnetic resonance spectroscopy data. However, I can help you interpret the data if you provide me with the information obtained from the spectroscopy analysis, such as chemical shifts, splitting patterns, and integration values. Once I have this information, I can help you determine the chemical structure and functional groups present in the unknown organic compound."
