    "message_2": "To calculate the pH of a 0.1 M solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl), we can use the formula:\n\npH = -log10[H+]\n\nHydrochloric acid is a strong acid, meaning it dissociates completely in water. Therefore, the concentration of H+ ions in the solution is equal to the concentration of the HCl solution. In this case, the concentration of H+ ions is 0.1 M.\n\nNow we can plug this value into the formula:\n\npH = -log10(0.1)\n\npH = -(-1)\n\npH = 1\n\nSo, the pH of a 0.1 M solution of hydrochloric acid at 25°C is 1. Since the pH meter has a sensitivity of 0.01 pH units, the measured pH value would be 1.00."
