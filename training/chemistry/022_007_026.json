    "message_2": "When sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) is subjected to thermal decomposition, the products formed are sodium oxide (Na2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2). The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nNa2CO3 (s) â†’ Na2O (s) + CO2 (g)\n\nDuring the experiment, you would observe the solid sodium carbonate gradually breaking down into a solid sodium oxide and releasing carbon dioxide gas. The release of carbon dioxide gas can be observed as bubbles or effervescence if the reaction is carried out in a closed container. The solid sodium oxide formed is a white or colorless crystalline solid, similar in appearance to the original sodium carbonate."
