    "message_2": "The specific base-pairing rule followed in DNA and RNA is known as the Watson-Crick base pairing rule, which states that in DNA, adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T), and guanine (G) pairs with cytosine (C). In RNA, adenine (A) pairs with uracil (U) instead of thymine, while guanine (G) still pairs with cytosine (C).\n\nThis base-pairing rule contributes to the stability and functionality of nucleic acids in several ways:\n\n1. Complementarity: The specific base pairing ensures that the two strands of DNA or RNA are complementary to each other, which is crucial for accurate replication and transcription processes.\n\n2. Stability: The hydrogen bonds formed between the base pairs provide stability to the DNA and RNA structures. In DNA, A-T pairs form two hydrogen bonds, while G-C pairs form three hydrogen bonds. In RNA, A-U pairs form two hydrogen bonds, and G-C pairs form three hydrogen bonds. The higher number of hydrogen bonds in G-C pairs provides greater stability to the nucleic acid structure.\n\n3. Specificity: The specific base pairing allows for the accurate recognition and binding of proteins, such as DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase, which are essential for replication, transcription, and translation processes.\n\nOne example of a structural difference between DNA and RNA that helps to explain the different functions they serve in the cell is the presence of the 2'-hydroxyl group in the ribose sugar of RNA. In DNA, the sugar is deoxyribose, which lacks the 2'-hydroxyl group. This difference has several implications:\n\n1. Stability: The absence of the 2'-hydroxyl group in DNA makes it more stable and less susceptible to hydrolysis, which is essential for its role as a long-term storage of genetic information.\n\n2. Functionality: The presence of the 2'-hydroxyl group in RNA allows it to adopt various secondary and tertiary structures, which are crucial for its diverse functions, such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.\n\n3. Distinct roles: The structural difference between DNA and RNA helps to ensure that they serve distinct roles in the cell, with DNA primarily functioning as the genetic material and RNA serving as an intermediary in the expression of genetic information."
