    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic moment of a transition metal complex, we can use the formula:\n\nμ = √(n(n+2)) * μB\n\nwhere μ is the magnetic moment, n is the number of unpaired electrons, and μB is the Bohr magneton (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T).\n\nIn the case of [Fe(CN)6]3-, the complex is in a high-spin state and has three unpaired electrons (n = 3). Now, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nμ = √(3(3+2)) * μB\nμ = √(3(5)) * μB\nμ = √15 * μB\n\nNow, we can multiply by the Bohr magneton:\n\nμ = √15 * (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T)\nμ ≈ 3.87 * (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T)\nμ ≈ 3.59 x 10^-23 J/T\n\nSo, the magnetic moment of the [Fe(CN)6]3- complex in a high-spin state with three unpaired electrons is approximately 3.59 x 10^-23 J/T."
