    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of energy required to completely desorb 2 moles of hydrogen molecules from a metal surface, we can use the following equation:\n\nEnergy = moles × enthalpy of desorption\n\nGiven that there are 2 moles of hydrogen molecules and the enthalpy of desorption for each H2 molecule is 436 kJ/mol, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nEnergy = 2 moles × 436 kJ/mol\n\nEnergy = 872 kJ\n\nTherefore, 872 kJ of energy is required to completely desorb 2 moles of hydrogen molecules from a metal surface."
