    "message_2": "To calculate the standard free energy change (ΔG°) for the redox reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG° = -nFE°cell\n\nwhere:\nΔG° = standard free energy change\nn = number of moles of electrons transferred in the redox reaction\nF = Faraday's constant (96,500 J/V.mol)\nE°cell = standard cell potential\n\nFirst, we need to determine the number of moles of electrons transferred in the redox reaction. The balanced half-reactions for the given redox reaction are:\n\nZn(s) → Zn²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ (oxidation half-reaction)\nCu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Cu(s) (reduction half-reaction)\n\nFrom the balanced half-reactions, we can see that 2 moles of electrons are transferred in the redox reaction. Therefore, n = 2.\n\nNow we can calculate ΔG° using the equation:\n\nΔG° = -nFE°cell\nΔG° = -(2 mol)(96,500 J/V.mol)(1.10 V)\n\nΔG° = -212,300 J/mol\n\nThe standard free energy change (ΔG°) for the given redox reaction at 298K is -212,300 J/mol."
