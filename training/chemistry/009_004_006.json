    "message_2": "The minimum temperature needed for nuclear fusion reactions to occur in a hydrogen-helium plasma is approximately 10 million Kelvin (10^7 K) or 10 million degrees Celsius. This temperature is required because nuclear fusion involves the combining of atomic nuclei, which are positively charged due to the presence of protons. \n\nAt lower temperatures, the electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged nuclei is too strong, preventing them from coming close enough to each other for the strong nuclear force to take over and bind them together. As the temperature increases, the kinetic energy of the particles also increases, allowing them to overcome the electrostatic repulsion and collide with enough force for the strong nuclear force to bind them together, resulting in nuclear fusion."
