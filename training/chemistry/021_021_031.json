    "message_2": "In methane (CH4), the hybrid orbitals present are sp3 hybrid orbitals. The carbon atom forms four sigma bonds with four hydrogen atoms, and to do so, it undergoes hybridization, where its 2s orbital and three 2p orbitals combine to form four sp3 hybrid orbitals. These sp3 hybrid orbitals are then used to form the four C-H bonds in the tetrahedral geometry of methane."
