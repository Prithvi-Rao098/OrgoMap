    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of stoichiometry. First, we need to write a balanced chemical equation for the reaction between methane (CH₄) and oxygen (O₂) to produce carbon dioxide (CO₂) and water (H₂O):\n\nCH₄ + 2 O₂ → CO₂ + 2 H₂O\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of moles of each reactant. We can do this by dividing the mass of each reactant by its molar mass:\n\nMolar mass of CH₄ = 12.01 g/mol (C) + 4 * 1.01 g/mol (H) = 16.05 g/mol\nMoles of CH₄ = 12.5 g / 16.05 g/mol = 0.778 moles\n\nMolar mass of O₂ = 2 * 16.00 g/mol (O) = 32.00 g/mol\nMoles of O₂ = 15.0 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.469 moles\n\nNow, we need to determine the limiting reactant, which is the reactant that will be completely consumed first and thus determine the amount of product formed:\n\nMole ratio of CH₄ to O₂ in the balanced equation = 1:2\nMoles of O₂ required to react with 0.778 moles of CH₄ = 0.778 * 2 = 1.556 moles\n\nSince we only have 0.469 moles of O₂, oxygen is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow we can determine the moles of CO₂ produced by the complete reaction of the limiting reactant:\n\nMole ratio of CO₂ to O₂ in the balanced equation = 1:2\nMoles of CO₂ produced = 0.469 moles of O₂ * (1 mole of CO₂ / 2 moles of O₂) = 0.2345 moles of CO₂\n\nFinally, we can convert the moles of CO₂ to grams:\n\nMolar mass of CO₂ = 12.01 g/mol (C) + 2 * 16.00 g/mol (O) = 44.01 g/mol\nMass of CO₂ produced = 0.2345 moles * 44.01 g/mol = 10.32 grams\n\nSo, the mass of carbon dioxide that can be produced by the complete reaction of 12.5 grams of methane and 15.0 grams of oxygen is approximately 10.32 grams."
