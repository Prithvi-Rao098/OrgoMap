    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction, we can use the expression:\n\nKc = [N2O4] / [NO2]^2\n\nGiven the concentrations of the reactants and products at equilibrium, we can plug in the values:\n\nKc = (0.2 M) / (0.1 M)^2\n\nKc = 0.2 / 0.01\n\nKc = 20\n\nThe equilibrium constant for the reaction at 298 K is 20."
