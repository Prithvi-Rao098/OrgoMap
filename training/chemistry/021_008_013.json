    "message_2": "The nitrate ion (NO3-) has three resonance structures. In each resonance structure, the nitrogen atom is at the center, and the three oxygen atoms are surrounding it. The nitrogen atom has a positive charge, and one of the oxygen atoms has a negative charge in each structure. The other two oxygen atoms have a double bond with the nitrogen atom. The three resonance structures can be represented as follows:\n\n1. O=N-O(-)-O\n2. O(-)-N=O-O\n3. O-O(-)-N=O\n\nIn these structures, the negative charge is distributed among the three oxygen atoms, and the positive charge is on the nitrogen atom.\n\nThe resonance hybrid structure of the nitrate ion is a blend of these three resonance structures. In the hybrid structure, the nitrogen atom is at the center, and the three oxygen atoms are surrounding it. Each N-O bond is a partial double bond, and the negative charge is distributed equally among the three oxygen atoms. The hybrid structure can be represented as:\n\nO(-δ)-N(+)-O(-δ)\n   | \nO(-δ)\n\nHere, the symbol \"δ\" represents a partial charge. The resonance hybrid structure shows that the nitrate ion has a delocalized negative charge and equal bond lengths for all three N-O bonds."
