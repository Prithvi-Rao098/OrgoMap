    "message_2": "To determine the theoretical maximum power output of a galvanic cell, we first need to find the cell potential (E°cell). The cell potential can be calculated using the standard reduction potentials of the two half-reactions involved.\n\nIn this case, the half-reactions are:\n\nCu2+ + 2e- → Cu (E° = -0.76 V)\nZn2+ + 2e- → Zn (E° = -0.34 V)\n\nSince the Zn2+/Zn half-reaction has a less negative reduction potential, it will act as the anode (oxidation) and the Cu2+/Cu half-reaction will act as the cathode (reduction). To find the cell potential, we need to reverse the anode half-reaction and subtract its standard reduction potential from the cathode's standard reduction potential:\n\nE°cell = E°cathode - E°anode\nE°cell = (-0.76 V) - (-0.34 V)\nE°cell = -0.42 V\n\nNow that we have the cell potential, we can calculate the maximum work (Wmax) that can be obtained from the cell using the following equation:\n\nWmax = -nFE°cell\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of electrons transferred (2 moles in this case, since both half-reactions involve 2 electrons), F is Faraday's constant (96,485 C/mol), and E°cell is the cell potential.\n\nWmax = -(2 mol)(96,485 C/mol)(-0.42 V)\nWmax = 81,124.2 J (joules)\n\nThe theoretical maximum power output of the galvanic cell is 81,124.2 J."
