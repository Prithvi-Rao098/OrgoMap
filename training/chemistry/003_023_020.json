    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat absorbed by the water, we can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat absorbed, m is the mass of the water, c is the specific heat of water, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nGiven:\nm = 50 g\nc = 4.18 J/g·K\nInitial temperature (T1) = 20°C\nFinal temperature (T2) = 100°C\n\nFirst, we need to find the change in temperature (ΔT):\n\nΔT = T2 - T1\nΔT = 100°C - 20°C\nΔT = 80°C\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nq = (50 g) × (4.18 J/g·K) × (80 K)\nq = 50 × 4.18 × 80\nq = 16720 J\n\nSo, the amount of heat absorbed by the 50 g sample of water when heated from 20°C to 100°C is 16,720 Joules."
