    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change, we first need to determine the number of moles of NH4Cl in 50.0 grams. The molar mass of NH4Cl is:\n\nMolar mass of NH4Cl = 14.01 (N) + 4 * 1.01 (H) + 35.45 (Cl) = 53.49 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the number of moles of NH4Cl:\n\nmoles of NH4Cl = mass / molar mass = 50.0 g / 53.49 g/mol = 0.934 mol\n\nNext, we can use the molar enthalpy of dissolution to find the enthalpy change:\n\nEnthalpy change = moles * molar enthalpy of dissolution = 0.934 mol * (-14.8 kJ/mol) = -13.82 kJ\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy change when 50.0 grams of ammonium chloride is dissolved in 250.0 mL of water at 25°C is -13.82 kJ."
