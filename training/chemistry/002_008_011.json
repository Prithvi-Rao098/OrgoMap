    "message_2": "To find the percent composition of magnesium chloride (MgCl2), we need to determine the molar mass of each element in the compound and then calculate the percentage of each element.\n\n1. Find the molar mass of each element in the compound:\n- Magnesium (Mg): 24.305 g/mol\n- Chlorine (Cl): 35.453 g/mol\n\n2. Calculate the molar mass of magnesium chloride (MgCl2):\nMgCl2 = Mg + 2 * Cl\nMgCl2 = 24.305 g/mol + 2 * 35.453 g/mol\nMgCl2 = 24.305 g/mol + 70.906 g/mol\nMgCl2 = 95.211 g/mol\n\n3. Calculate the percent composition of each element in the compound:\n- Magnesium (Mg): (24.305 g/mol / 95.211 g/mol) * 100% = 25.53%\n- Chlorine (Cl): (70.906 g/mol / 95.211 g/mol) * 100% = 74.47%\n\nSo, the percent composition of magnesium chloride (MgCl2) is approximately 25.53% magnesium (Mg) and 74.47% chlorine (Cl)."
