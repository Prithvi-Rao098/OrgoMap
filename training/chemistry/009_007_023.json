    "message_2": "74Be is not a candidate for beta decay. Here's the explanation based on the concept of nuclear stability and the rules guiding the decay modes of isotopes:\n\nNuclear stability is determined by the balance between protons and neutrons in the nucleus. The stability of a nucleus is governed by the strong nuclear force, which holds protons and neutrons together, and the electrostatic repulsion between protons. Generally, isotopes with an equal number of protons and neutrons are more stable for elements with low atomic numbers, while heavier elements require a higher neutron-to-proton ratio for stability.\n\nBeta decay occurs when a nucleus has an excess of neutrons or protons, leading to an imbalance in the neutron-to-proton ratio. There are two types of beta decay: beta-minus decay (β-) and beta-plus decay (β+). In β- decay, a neutron is converted into a proton, while in β+ decay, a proton is converted into a neutron.\n\nNow, let's analyze the isotopes mentioned:\n\n1. 13C: Carbon-13 has 6 protons and 7 neutrons. It is a stable isotope, as its neutron-to-proton ratio is close to 1:1, which is ideal for lighter elements.\n\n2. 14C: Carbon-14 has 6 protons and 8 neutrons. It is an unstable isotope and undergoes β- decay, as it has an excess of neutrons compared to protons.\n\n3. 16C: Carbon-16 has 6 protons and 10 neutrons. It is an unstable isotope and undergoes β- decay, as it has an even greater excess of neutrons compared to protons.\n\n4. 74Be: Beryllium-7 has 4 protons and 3 neutrons. It is an unstable isotope, but it does not undergo beta decay. Instead, it undergoes electron capture, a process in which a proton in the nucleus captures an electron from the inner electron shell and converts into a neutron. This occurs because 74Be has a lower neutron-to-proton ratio than the ideal 1:1 for lighter elements, so converting a proton into a neutron helps to restore the balance.\n\nIn conclusion, 74Be is not a candidate for beta decay because it undergoes electron capture to increase its neutron-to-proton ratio, rather than undergoing beta decay to decrease it."
