    "message_2": "First, we need to determine the limiting reactant in this reaction. To do this, we can calculate the moles of HCl and NaOH in the given volumes and concentrations.\n\nMoles of HCl = (volume in L) × (concentration in mol/L)\nMoles of HCl = (50.0 mL × (1 L/1000 mL)) × 0.500 mol/L = 0.0250 mol\n\nMoles of NaOH = (volume in L) × (concentration in mol/L)\nMoles of NaOH = (25.0 mL × (1 L/1000 mL)) × 1.00 mol/L = 0.0250 mol\n\nSince the balanced chemical equation has a 1:1 ratio between HCl and NaOH, and both have the same number of moles, neither reactant is limiting in this case.\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat released (q) during the reaction using the enthalpy change and the moles of the limiting reactant (either HCl or NaOH, since they are equal).\n\nq = moles × enthalpy change\nq = 0.0250 mol × -58 kJ/mol = -1.45 kJ\n\nSince the reaction is exothermic, the heat released will cause the temperature of the solution to increase. We can calculate the temperature change (ΔT) using the heat released, the mass of the solution, and the specific heat capacity (c) of the solution.\n\nFirst, we need to find the mass of the solution:\nmass = volume × density\nmass = (50.0 mL + 25.0 mL) × 1.00 g/mL = 75.0 g\n\nNow, we can calculate the temperature change:\nq = mcΔT\nΔT = q / (mc)\nΔT = -1.45 kJ / (75.0 g × 4.18 J/g•°C)\nΔT = -1450 J / (75.0 g × 4.18 J/g•°C) = -7.76 °C\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for this reaction is -1.45 kJ, and the temperature change of the solution is -7.76 °C."
