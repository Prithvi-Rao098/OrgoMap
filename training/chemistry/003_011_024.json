    "message_2": "In the sodium chloride (NaCl) crystal structure, each sodium ion (Na+) is surrounded by six chloride ions (Cl-) in an octahedral arrangement. Therefore, the coordination number of the sodium ion (Na+) in the sodium chloride crystal structure is 6. This also means that a sodium ion has 6 nearest neighbors."
