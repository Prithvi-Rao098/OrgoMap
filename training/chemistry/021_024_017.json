    "message_2": "To determine the bond order of O2 using molecular orbital theory, we need to first find the number of electrons in bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals.\n\nOxygen has 8 electrons, so an O2 molecule has a total of 16 electrons. According to molecular orbital theory, the order in which the molecular orbitals are filled is as follows: σ1s, σ*1s, σ2s, σ*2s, σ2pz, π2px = π2py, π*2px = π*2py.\n\nNow, let's fill the molecular orbitals with the 16 electrons:\n\n1. σ1s and σ*1s can hold 2 electrons each, so 4 electrons fill these orbitals.\n2. σ2s and σ*2s can hold 2 electrons each, so 4 electrons fill these orbitals.\n3. σ2pz can hold 2 electrons, so 2 electrons fill this orbital.\n4. π2px and π2py can hold 2 electrons each, so 4 electrons fill these orbitals.\n5. π*2px and π*2py can hold 2 electrons each, but only 2 electrons are left, so they fill one of these orbitals.\n\nNow, we can calculate the bond order using the formula:\n\nBond order = (number of electrons in bonding orbitals - number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\n\nBond order = (10 - 6) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2\n\nSo, the bond order of O2 using molecular orbital theory is 2."
