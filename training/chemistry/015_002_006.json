    "message_2": "The molecular geometry of methane (CH4) is tetrahedral. In a tetrahedral geometry, the central carbon atom is surrounded by four hydrogen atoms, with each hydrogen atom located at the vertices of a regular tetrahedron. The bond angles between the hydrogen-carbon-hydrogen (H-C-H) atoms are approximately 109.5 degrees.\n\nThis tetrahedral geometry and bond angles affect the molecule's properties in several ways:\n\n1. Symmetry: The tetrahedral geometry makes the molecule symmetrical, which means that it has no net dipole moment. This results in methane being a nonpolar molecule, as the electron distribution is even and the bond dipoles cancel each other out.\n\n2. Stability: The tetrahedral arrangement of hydrogen atoms around the central carbon atom allows for optimal spacing, minimizing electron repulsion between the hydrogen atoms. This contributes to the stability of the methane molecule.\n\n3. Reactivity: Methane is relatively unreactive under normal conditions due to the strong carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds and the nonpolar nature of the molecule. However, it can undergo combustion in the presence of oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water, releasing a significant amount of energy.\n\n4. Physical properties: The nonpolar nature of methane results in weak intermolecular forces (specifically, London dispersion forces) between its molecules. This leads to a low boiling point (-161.5°C) and melting point (-182.5°C), making methane a gas at room temperature and atmospheric pressure."
