    "message_2": "The synthesis of ibuprofen from 2-methylpropylbenzene (isobutylbenzene) and carbon dioxide can be achieved through a series of reactions. Here is a step-by-step reaction mechanism for this process:\n\n1. Friedel-Crafts Acylation:\nIn the first step, 2-methylpropylbenzene (isobutylbenzene) undergoes Friedel-Crafts acylation with acetyl chloride (CH3COCl) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, such as aluminum chloride (AlCl3). This reaction results in the formation of 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanoyl chloride.\n\n2. Hydrolysis:\nThe 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanoyl chloride is then hydrolyzed in the presence of water and a base, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH), to form 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionic acid, which is also known as Î±-methyl-4-(2-methylpropyl)benzeneacetic acid.\n\n3. Kolbe-Schmitt Reaction:\nThe next step is the Kolbe-Schmitt reaction, which involves the carboxylation of the aromatic ring. In this reaction, the 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionic acid reacts with carbon dioxide (CO2) in the presence of a strong base, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH), under high temperature and pressure. This leads to the formation of sodium 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionate.\n\n4. Acidification:\nFinally, the sodium 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionate is acidified using a strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl), to form ibuprofen (2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionic acid).\n\nIn summary, the synthesis of ibuprofen from 2-methylpropylbenzene and carbon dioxide involves Friedel-Crafts acylation, hydrolysis, Kolbe-Schmitt reaction, and acidification. The key reagents and catalysts involved in this process include acetyl chloride, aluminum chloride, sodium hydroxide, and hydrochloric acid."
