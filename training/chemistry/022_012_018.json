    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of molarity and the balanced chemical equation for the neutralization reaction between HCl and NaOH:\n\nHCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H2O(l)\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of HCl reacts with 1 mole of NaOH. We can use the formula:\n\nmoles of HCl = moles of NaOH\n\nTo find the moles of NaOH, we can use the formula:\n\nmoles = molarity × volume (in liters)\n\nmoles of NaOH = 0.2 M × 0.025 L = 0.005 moles\n\nNow, we can find the volume of HCl required to neutralize the NaOH:\n\nmoles of HCl = moles of NaOH\n0.005 moles = 0.1 M × volume (in liters)\n\nvolume (in liters) = 0.005 moles / 0.1 M = 0.05 L\n\nTo convert the volume to milliliters, we can multiply by 1000:\n\nvolume (in mL) = 0.05 L × 1000 = 50 mL\n\nSo, 50 mL of 0.1M HCl is required to neutralize 25 mL of 0.2M NaOH."
