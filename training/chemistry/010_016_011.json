    "message_2": "To calculate the polarization of the copper-silver galvanic cell, we first need to determine the standard cell potential (E°) for the cell. The half-cell reactions for copper and silver are:\n\nCu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Cu(s)  E°(Cu²⁺/Cu) = +0.34 V\nAg⁺(aq) + e⁻ → Ag(s)  E°(Ag⁺/Ag) = +0.80 V\n\nThe overall cell reaction is:\nCu²⁺(aq) + 2Ag(s) → Cu(s) + 2Ag⁺(aq)\n\nThe standard cell potential (E°) for the cell is the difference between the standard reduction potentials of the two half-cells:\nE°(cell) = E°(Ag⁺/Ag) - E°(Cu²⁺/Cu) = 0.80 V - 0.34 V = 0.46 V\n\nNow, we can use the Nernst equation to calculate the actual cell potential (E) under the given conditions:\n\nE = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\n\nwhere R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin (25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K), n is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction (2 for this cell), F is the Faraday constant (96485 C/mol), and Q is the reaction quotient.\n\nFor the reaction quotient (Q), we have:\n\nQ = [Ag⁺]²/[Cu²⁺] = (0.1 M)²/(0.5 M) = 0.02\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the Nernst equation:\n\nE = 0.46 V - (8.314 J/mol·K * 298.15 K / (2 * 96485 C/mol)) * ln(0.02)\nE ≈ 0.46 V - 0.0129 V * ln(0.02)\nE ≈ 0.46 V - 0.0129 V * (-3.912)\nE ≈ 0.46 V + 0.0505 V\nE ≈ 0.5105 V\n\nThe polarization of the cell is the difference between the measured potential difference and the calculated cell potential:\n\nPolarization = Measured potential - Calculated potential\nPolarization = 0.75 V - 0.5105 V\nPolarization ≈ 0.2395 V"
