    "message_2": "To calculate the activation energy, we can use the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk = Ae^(-Ea / RT)\n\nWhere:\nk = rate constant (4.2 × 10^-4 L/mol.s)\nA = frequency factor (1.5 × 10^12 s^-1)\nEa = activation energy (which we want to find)\nR = gas constant (8.314 J/mol.K)\nT = temperature in Kelvin (25°C = 298K)\n\nFirst, we need to isolate Ea in the equation:\n\nk / A = e^(-Ea / RT)\n\nNow, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(k / A) = -Ea / RT\n\nNext, multiply both sides by -RT:\n\nEa = -RT * ln(k / A)\n\nNow, plug in the values:\n\nEa = - (8.314 J/mol.K) * (298 K) * ln((4.2 × 10^-4 L/mol.s) / (1.5 × 10^12 s^-1))\n\nEa ≈ - (8.314 J/mol.K) * (298 K) * ln(2.8 × 10^-16)\n\nEa ≈ 173,000 J/mol\n\nThe activation energy for the reaction between hydrogen gas and iodine gas to form hydrogen iodide is approximately 173 kJ/mol."
