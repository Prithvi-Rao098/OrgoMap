    "message_2": "To find the pH of the buffer, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n\nFirst, we need to find the pKa from the given Ka value:\n\npKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.8 × 10^-5) ≈ 4.74\n\nNext, we need to find the concentrations of acetic acid (HA) and acetate ion (A-) after mixing the solutions.\n\nThe total volume of the buffer is 100 mL + 50 mL = 150 mL.\n\nFor acetic acid (HA):\nInitial moles of HA = 0.1 M × 0.100 L = 0.010 moles\nFinal concentration of HA = 0.010 moles / 0.150 L = 0.0667 M\n\nFor sodium acetate (A-):\nInitial moles of A- = 0.2 M × 0.050 L = 0.010 moles\nFinal concentration of A- = 0.010 moles / 0.150 L = 0.0667 M\n\nNow we can plug these values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = 4.74 + log(0.0667/0.0667)\n\nSince the ratio of [A-] to [HA] is 1, the log term becomes 0:\n\npH = 4.74 + 0 = 4.74\n\nSo the pH of the buffer is 4.74."
