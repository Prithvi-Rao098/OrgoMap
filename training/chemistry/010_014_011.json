    "message_1": "A student wants to electroplate a piece of copper with silver in an electrochemical cell. If a current of 0.5 A is passed through the cell for 30 minutes, what mass of silver will be deposited on the copper piece? The atomic mass of silver is 107.87 g/mol and the faraday constant is 96,485 C/mol.",
    "message_2": "To determine the mass of silver deposited on the copper piece, we can use Faraday's law of electrolysis. First, we need to calculate the total charge passed through the cell.\n\nCharge (Q) = Current (I) × Time (t)\nwhere I = 0.5 A and t = 30 minutes = 1800 seconds\n\nQ = 0.5 A × 1800 s = 900 Coulombs\n\nNow, we can use Faraday's law to find the moles of silver deposited:\n\nMoles of silver (n) = Charge (Q) / (Faraday constant (F) × number of electrons involved in the redox reaction)\n\nFor silver, the redox reaction is Ag+ + e- → Ag, so the number of electrons involved is 1.\n\nn = 900 C / (96,485 C/mol × 1) = 0.00933 mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the mass of silver deposited:\n\nMass of silver = Moles of silver × Atomic mass of silver\nMass of silver = 0.00933 mol × 107.87 g/mol = 1.006 g\n\nTherefore, the mass of silver deposited on the copper piece is approximately 1.006 grams."
