    "message_2": "The reaction between 2-bromo-2-methylpentane and sodium ethoxide to form 2-methyl-2-pentene is an E2 (elimination bimolecular) reaction. In this reaction, the bromine atom is eliminated along with a hydrogen atom from the neighboring carbon, resulting in the formation of a double bond. Here's the detailed step-by-step process of the reaction:\n\n1. Formation of ethoxide ion: Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) is a strong base, and it exists in an equilibrium with its conjugate acid, ethanol (EtOH). In this step, sodium ethoxide dissociates into sodium ion (Na+) and ethoxide ion (EtO-).\n\nNaOEt → Na+ + EtO-\n\n2. Deprotonation: The ethoxide ion (EtO-) acts as a strong base and abstracts a proton (H+) from the β-carbon (carbon next to the carbon attached to the bromine atom) of 2-bromo-2-methylpentane. This step generates an alkoxide intermediate.\n\nEtO- + (CH3)2CBrCH2CH3 → EtOH + [(CH3)2CBrCHCH3]-\n\n3. Formation of the double bond: The alkoxide intermediate formed in the previous step undergoes a concerted process where the electrons from the carbon-hydrogen bond move to form a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) between the α- and β-carbons. Simultaneously, the carbon-bromine bond breaks, and the bromide ion (Br-) is eliminated.\n\n[(CH3)2CBrCHCH3]- → (CH3)2C=CHCH3 + Br-\n\n4. Final product: The resulting product is 2-methyl-2-pentene, which is formed along with the byproducts ethanol and bromide ion.\n\nOverall reaction:\n\n(CH3)2CBrCH2CH3 + NaOEt → (CH3)2C=CHCH3 + EtOH + NaBr"
