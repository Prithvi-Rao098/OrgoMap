    "message_1": "A sample of an inorganic compound contains 51.28% sodium, 21.44% sulfur, and 27.28% oxygen by mass. Determine the empirical formula of the compound.",
    "message_2": "To determine the empirical formula of the compound, we need to find the mole ratio of the elements present in the compound. We will use the given mass percentages and the molar masses of the elements to calculate the moles of each element.\n\n1. Convert mass percentages to grams (assuming we have a 100 g sample):\n- Sodium (Na): 51.28 g\n- Sulfur (S): 21.44 g\n- Oxygen (O): 27.28 g\n\n2. Calculate moles of each element using their molar masses:\n- Moles of Na = (51.28 g) / (22.99 g/mol) = 2.23 mol\n- Moles of S = (21.44 g) / (32.07 g/mol) = 0.67 mol\n- Moles of O = (27.28 g) / (16.00 g/mol) = 1.71 mol\n\n3. Determine the mole ratio by dividing each value by the smallest number of moles:\n- Na: 2.23 / 0.67 = 3.33 ≈ 3\n- S: 0.67 / 0.67 = 1\n- O: 1.71 / 0.67 = 2.55 ≈ 3\n\n4. The empirical formula is Na3S1O3, which can be written as Na3SO3.\n\nSo, the empirical formula of the compound is Na3SO3."
