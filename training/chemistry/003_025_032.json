Calculate the equilibrium constant (Kp) for this reaction.",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant expression (Kp) for the given reaction, we need to use the formula:\n\nKp = [products]^coefficients / [reactants]^coefficients\n\nFor the reaction:\n\n2NH3(g) ↔ N2(g) + 3H2(g)\n\nThe Kp expression will be:\n\nKp = [N2]^1 * [H2]^3 / [NH3]^2\n\nNow we are given the partial pressures at equilibrium:\n\n[NH3] = 0.25 atm\n[N2] = 0.10 atm\n[H2] = 0.15 atm\n\nPlug these values into the Kp expression:\n\nKp = (0.10)^1 * (0.15)^3 / (0.25)^2\n\nKp = (0.10) * (0.003375) / (0.0625)\n\nKp ≈ 0.0054\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (Kp) for this reaction is approximately 0.0054."
