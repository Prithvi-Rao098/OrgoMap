    "message_1": "Consider the following equation: Fe + HCl --> FeCl3 + H2. \n\nIf you have 10 grams of Fe and an excess of HCl, what mass of H2 will be produced?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use stoichiometry. First, we need to balance the chemical equation:\n\nFe + 6HCl --> FeCl3 + 3H2\n\nNow that the equation is balanced, we can proceed with the stoichiometry calculations.\n\n1. Determine the molar mass of Fe and H2.\nFe: 55.85 g/mol\nH2: 2.02 g/mol (1.01 g/mol for each H atom)\n\n2. Convert the mass of Fe to moles.\n10 g Fe * (1 mol Fe / 55.85 g Fe) = 0.179 moles Fe\n\n3. Use the stoichiometry from the balanced equation to determine the moles of H2 produced.\n0.179 moles Fe * (3 moles H2 / 1 mole Fe) = 0.536 moles H2\n\n4. Convert the moles of H2 to grams.\n0.536 moles H2 * (2.02 g H2 / 1 mole H2) = 1.08 g H2\n\nSo, 1.08 grams of H2 will be produced."
