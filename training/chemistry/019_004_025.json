    "message_2": "To calculate the entropy change (ΔS) for the combustion of methane gas (CH4) at constant pressure and standard conditions, we can use the Hess's Law. According to Hess's Law, the total entropy change for a reaction is the sum of the entropy changes for the individual steps that make up the overall reaction.\n\nFirst, we need to rewrite the given reactions in a way that they add up to the desired reaction:\n\n1. C(s) + O2(g) → CO2(g)      ΔS° = -394 J/K·mol\n2. 2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(l)   ΔS° = -237 J/K·mol\n\nThe desired reaction is:\n\nCH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(l)\n\nWe can break down the desired reaction into two steps:\n\nStep 1: CH4(g) → C(s) + 2H2(g)\nStep 2: C(s) + 2H2(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(l)\n\nNow, we need to find the entropy change for Step 1. Since we don't have the entropy change for this reaction, we can use the fact that ΔS = ΔH/T, where ΔH is the enthalpy change and T is the temperature. We know that ΔH for the desired reaction is -802 kJ/mol, and the standard temperature is 298 K. Therefore, ΔS for Step 1 can be calculated as:\n\nΔS = (-802 kJ/mol) / 298 K = -2.694 J/K·mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the total entropy change for the desired reaction by adding the entropy changes for Step 1 and Step 2:\n\nΔS_total = ΔS_step1 + ΔS_step2\nΔS_total = -2.694 J/K·mol + (-394 J/K·mol) + (-237 J/K·mol)\nΔS_total = -633.694 J/K·mol\n\nSo, the entropy change (ΔS) for the combustion of methane gas (CH4) at constant pressure and standard conditions is -633.694 J/K·mol."
