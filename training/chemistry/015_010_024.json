    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic moment of a molecule with a given geometry and electron configuration, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the number of unpaired electrons in the molecule. This can be done by analyzing the electron configuration and identifying the electrons that are not paired in the molecular orbitals.\n\n2. Calculate the magnetic moment (μ) using the formula:\n\nμ = √(n(n+2))\n\nwhere n is the number of unpaired electrons.\n\nThe magnetic moment is expressed in units of Bohr magnetons (μB).\n\nFor example, let's consider a molecule with an electron configuration that has two unpaired electrons. The magnetic moment would be:\n\nμ = √(2(2+2)) = √(2(4)) = √8 = 2.83 μB\n\nKeep in mind that the magnetic moment is highly dependent on the geometry and electron configuration of the molecule, so it's essential to have accurate information about the molecule's structure to obtain a precise calculation."
