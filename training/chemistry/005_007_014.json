    "message_2": "Ribosomes play a crucial role in the process of translation, which is the synthesis of proteins based on the genetic information encoded in messenger RNA (mRNA). They do not have a direct role in transcription, which is the process of copying DNA into RNA, primarily mRNA. Transcription is carried out by an enzyme called RNA polymerase.\n\nRibosomes are composed of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and proteins, and they have two subunits: a large subunit and a small subunit. The structure of ribosomes contributes to their function in protein synthesis in several ways:\n\n1. The small subunit of the ribosome binds to the mRNA and is responsible for recognizing the start codon, which signals the beginning of the protein-coding sequence. This ensures that translation begins at the correct location on the mRNA.\n\n2. The large subunit of the ribosome contains three binding sites for transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules, which carry amino acids to the ribosome for incorporation into the growing protein chain. These sites are called the A (aminoacyl) site, the P (peptidyl) site, and the E (exit) site. The structure of the large subunit allows for the proper positioning of tRNA molecules and facilitates the formation of peptide bonds between adjacent amino acids.\n\n3. The ribosome moves along the mRNA in a 5' to 3' direction, reading the codons (three-nucleotide sequences) and matching them with the appropriate tRNA carrying the corresponding amino acid. The structure of the ribosome ensures that the mRNA is read accurately and efficiently.\n\n4. The ribosome also plays a role in the termination of translation. When a stop codon is encountered, the ribosome recognizes it and releases the completed protein chain, allowing it to fold into its functional three-dimensional structure.\n\nIn summary, ribosomes are essential for the process of translation, and their structure allows them to accurately and efficiently synthesize proteins based on the genetic information encoded in mRNA."
