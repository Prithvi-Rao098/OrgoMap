    "message_2": "In the molecule CH4 (methane), the central carbon atom forms sp3 hybrid orbitals. These orbitals are formed by the hybridization of one 2s orbital and three 2p orbitals in the carbon atom, resulting in four equivalent sp3 hybrid orbitals. These sp3 hybrid orbitals form four sigma bonds with four hydrogen atoms, creating a tetrahedral geometry around the central carbon atom."
