    "message_2": "Xenon hexafluoride (XeF4) is a noble gas compound with xenon in its highest possible oxidation state (+4). Xenon, being a noble gas, has a stable electronic configuration with completely filled orbitals (1s2, 2s2 2p6, 3s2 3p6 3d10, 4s2 4p6 4d10, 5s2 5p6). However, under certain conditions, it can form compounds with highly electronegative elements like fluorine.\n\nIn XeF4, xenon uses its two 5d orbitals and two 5p orbitals to form four Xe-F sigma bonds, leaving two lone pairs in its remaining 5p orbitals. The molecule has a square planar geometry (AX4E2) due to the presence of these lone pairs, and it obeys the octet rule.\n\nThe reactivity of XeF4 is relatively low compared to other inorganic compounds like SF4 and IF5. This is primarily due to the noble gas nature of xenon, which makes it less likely to participate in chemical reactions. Additionally, the strong Xe-F bonds in XeF4 contribute to its stability and lower reactivity.\n\nSulfur tetrafluoride (SF4) is more reactive than XeF4. Sulfur, being in group 16, has a higher tendency to form compounds. In SF4, sulfur has an oxidation state of +4 and a seesaw molecular geometry (AX4E). The presence of a lone pair on sulfur and the polar nature of the S-F bonds make SF4 more reactive than XeF4.\n\nIodine pentafluoride (IF5) is also more reactive than XeF4. Iodine, being in group 17, has a higher tendency to form compounds compared to xenon. In IF5, iodine has an oxidation state of +5 and a square pyramidal molecular geometry (AX5E). The presence of a lone pair on iodine and the polar nature of the I-F bonds contribute to the higher reactivity of IF5 compared to XeF4.\n\nIn summary, XeF4 has a relatively low reactivity due to its noble gas nature and strong Xe-F bonds. In comparison, SF4 and IF5 are more reactive due to their polar bonds and the presence of lone pairs on their central atoms."
