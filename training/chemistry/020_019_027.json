    "message_2": "When the pH of a solution is changed, it affects the formation of a complex ion between copper and ammonia by altering the concentration of the reactants and the stability of the complex ion. To understand this, let's first look at the chemical equation for the formation of the copper-ammonia complex ion:\n\nCu²⁺(aq) + 4NH₃(aq) ⇌ [Cu(NH₃)₄]²⁺(aq)\n\nIn this reaction, copper ions (Cu²⁺) in the solution react with ammonia (NH₃) to form a complex ion, [Cu(NH₃)₄]²⁺. The formation of this complex ion is influenced by the pH of the solution, as the pH affects the concentration of ammonia and the stability of the complex ion.\n\nWhen the pH of the solution is increased (i.e., the solution becomes more basic), the concentration of ammonia increases. This is because ammonia is a weak base and can react with water to form hydroxide ions (OH⁻) and ammonium ions (NH₄⁺):\n\nNH₃(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ NH₄⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n\nAs the pH increases, the equilibrium of this reaction shifts to the left, increasing the concentration of ammonia in the solution. This increase in ammonia concentration favors the formation of the copper-ammonia complex ion, as shown in the first equation.\n\nConversely, when the pH of the solution is decreased (i.e., the solution becomes more acidic), the concentration of ammonia decreases. This is because ammonia reacts with hydronium ions (H₃O⁺) present in the acidic solution to form ammonium ions (NH₄⁺):\n\nNH₃(aq) + H₃O⁺(aq) ⇌ NH₄⁺(aq) + H₂O(l)\n\nAs the pH decreases, the equilibrium of this reaction shifts to the right, decreasing the concentration of ammonia in the solution. This decrease in ammonia concentration disfavors the formation of the copper-ammonia complex ion.\n\nTo quantify the effect of pH on the formation of the copper-ammonia complex ion, we can use the equilibrium constant (K) for the reaction:\n\nK = [Cu(NH₃)₄]²⁺ / ([Cu²⁺][NH₃]⁴)\n\nBy measuring the concentrations of the reactants and products at different pH values, we can determine the effect of pH on the formation of the complex ion. For example, if we find that the concentration of the complex ion increases as the pH increases, this would confirm that the formation of the complex ion is favored at higher pH values.\n\nIn summary, changing the pH of a solution affects the formation of a complex ion between copper and ammonia by altering the concentration of ammonia and the stability of the complex ion. At higher pH values (more basic conditions), the formation of the copper-ammonia complex ion is favored, while at lower pH values (more acidic conditions), the formation of the complex ion is disfavored."
