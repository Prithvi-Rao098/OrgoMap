    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the combustion of 1 mole of propane, we need the enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) for all the reactants and products involved in the reaction. The enthalpy change for the reaction can be calculated using Hess's Law:\n\nΔH° = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants)\n\nThe standard enthalpies of formation for CO2, H2O, and C3H8 are as follows:\n\nΔHf°(CO2) = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(H2O) = -241.8 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(C3H8) = -103.8 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(O2) = 0 kJ/mol (since O2 is in its elemental form)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into Hess's Law equation:\n\nΔH° = [3 × ΔHf°(CO2) + 4 × ΔHf°(H2O)] - [ΔHf°(C3H8) + 5 × ΔHf°(O2)]\n\nΔH° = [3 × (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 4 × (-241.8 kJ/mol)] - [(-103.8 kJ/mol) + 5 × (0 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH° = (-1180.5 kJ + -967.2 kJ) - (-103.8 kJ)\n\nΔH° = -2147.7 kJ + 103.8 kJ\n\nΔH° = -2043.9 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the enthalpy change for the combustion of 1 mole of propane (C3H8) is -2043.9 kJ/mol."
