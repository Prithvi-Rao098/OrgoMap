    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the reduction of CuO using hydrogen gas, we need to know the standard enthalpy of formation for each compound involved in the reaction. The standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) values are as follows:\n\nCuO (s): -155.2 kJ/mol\nH2 (g): 0 kJ/mol (since it's an element in its standard state)\nCu (s): 0 kJ/mol (since it's an element in its standard state)\nH2O (l): -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can use Hess's Law to calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nΔHrxn = Σ [ΔHf° (products)] - Σ [ΔHf° (reactants)]\n\nΔHrxn = [ΔHf° (Cu) + ΔHf° (H2O)] - [ΔHf° (CuO) + ΔHf° (H2)]\n\nΔHrxn = [0 + (-285.8)] - [(-155.2) + 0]\n\nΔHrxn = -130.6 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of moles of CuO and H2 involved in the reaction. The molar mass of CuO is 63.5 (Cu) + 16.0 (O) = 79.5 g/mol. \n\nMoles of CuO = mass / molar mass = 2.50 g / 79.5 g/mol = 0.0314 mol\n\nAt STP (standard temperature and pressure), 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 L. \n\nMoles of H2 = volume / molar volume = 0.500 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.0223 mol\n\nSince the balanced chemical equation has a 1:1 stoichiometry between CuO and H2, we can see that H2 is the limiting reactant. Therefore, we will base our calculations on the moles of H2.\n\nEnthalpy change for the reaction based on the moles of H2:\n\nΔH = ΔHrxn × moles of H2 = -130.6 kJ/mol × 0.0223 mol = -2.91 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change for the reduction of 2.50 g of CuO using 0.500 L of H2 gas at STP is approximately -2.91 kJ."
