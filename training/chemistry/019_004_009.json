    "message_2": "To calculate the entropy change (ΔS°) for the reaction, we need to find the difference between the standard entropy values of the products and the reactants. The equation for this is:\n\nΔS°(reaction) = ΣΔS°(products) - ΣΔS°(reactants)\n\nFor the reactants, we have:\n2 moles of NH3: 2 * 192.5 J/K•mol = 385 J/K•mol\n3 moles of Cl2: 3 * 223.1 J/K•mol = 669.3 J/K•mol\n\nFor the products, we have:\n1 mole of N2: 1 * 191.6 J/K•mol = 191.6 J/K•mol\n6 moles of HCl: 6 * 186.9 J/K•mol = 1121.4 J/K•mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the entropy change for the reaction:\n\nΔS°(reaction) = (191.6 + 1121.4) - (385 + 669.3)\nΔS°(reaction) = 1313 - 1054.3\nΔS°(reaction) = 258.7 J/K•mol\n\nThe entropy change for the reaction at 25°C and 1 atm pressure is 258.7 J/K•mol."
