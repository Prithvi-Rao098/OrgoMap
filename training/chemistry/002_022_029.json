    "message_2": "To calculate the lattice energy of CaF₂, we can use the Born-Haber cycle or the Coulomb's Law equation for lattice energy:\n\nLattice Energy = (k * Q₁ * Q₂) / r\n\nwhere:\nk = Coulomb's constant (8.9875517923 × 10⁹ N·m²/C²)\nQ₁ = charge on the calcium ion (+2)\nQ₂ = charge on the fluoride ion (-1)\nr = distance between the ions (2.01 Å, which needs to be converted to meters)\n\nFirst, let's convert the distance between the ions from Å to meters:\n\n1 Å = 1 × 10⁻¹⁰ meters\n2.01 Å = 2.01 × 10⁻¹⁰ meters\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the equation:\n\nLattice Energy = (8.9875517923 × 10⁹ N·m²/C²) * (+2) * (-1) / (2.01 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)\n\nLattice Energy = -8.9875517923 × 10⁹ N·m²/C² * 2 / 2.01 × 10⁻¹⁰ m\n\nLattice Energy = -17.9751035846 × 10⁹ N·m²/C² / 2.01 × 10⁻¹⁰ m\n\nLattice Energy = -8.947 × 10⁻¹⁸ J\n\nNow, we need to convert the energy from Joules to kilojoules per mole:\n\n1 J = 0.001 kJ\n1 mole = 6.022 × 10²³ particles\n\nLattice Energy = -8.947 × 10⁻¹⁸ kJ/particle * 6.022 × 10²³ particles/mole\n\nLattice Energy = -5386.4 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the lattice energy of CaF₂ is approximately -5386.4 kJ/mol."
