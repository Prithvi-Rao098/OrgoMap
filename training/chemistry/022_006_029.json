    "message_2": "The balanced chemical equation for the synthesis reaction between magnesium and oxygen to form magnesium oxide is:\n\n2 Mg + O₂ → 2 MgO\n\nTo find the mass of magnesium oxide produced, we need to use stoichiometry. First, we need to find the molar mass of magnesium and magnesium oxide:\n\nMg: 24.31 g/mol\nMgO: (24.31 g/mol for Mg) + (16.00 g/mol for O) = 40.31 g/mol\n\nNow, we can use the given mass of magnesium (5 grams) to find the moles of magnesium:\n\nmoles of Mg = (5 g) / (24.31 g/mol) = 0.2056 mol\n\nAccording to the balanced equation, 2 moles of Mg produce 2 moles of MgO. Therefore, the moles of Mg and MgO are in a 1:1 ratio. So, we have 0.2056 moles of MgO produced.\n\nFinally, we can find the mass of magnesium oxide produced:\n\nmass of MgO = (0.2056 mol) × (40.31 g/mol) = 8.29 g\n\nSo, 8.29 grams of magnesium oxide will be produced if 5 grams of magnesium reacts with excess oxygen."
