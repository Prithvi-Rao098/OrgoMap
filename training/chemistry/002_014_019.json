    "message_2": "To calculate the formal charge of an atom in a molecule or ion, we use the following formula:\n\nFormal charge = (Valence electrons) - (Non-bonding electrons) - 1/2(Bonding electrons)\n\nFor the perchlorate ion (ClO₄⁻), we have one chlorine atom (Cl) and four oxygen atoms (O). We will calculate the formal charge for both the oxygen and chlorine atoms.\n\n1. Oxygen atom:\nValence electrons of oxygen = 6 (as it is in group 16 of the periodic table)\nIn the ClO₄⁻ ion, each oxygen atom is bonded to the chlorine atom through a single bond. So, there are 2 bonding electrons for each oxygen atom.\nNon-bonding electrons = 6 - 2 = 4 (as there are two lone pairs on each oxygen atom)\n\nNow, we can calculate the formal charge of the oxygen atom:\nFormal charge of O = (6) - (4) - 1/2(2) = 6 - 4 - 1 = +1\n\n2. Chlorine atom:\nValence electrons of chlorine = 7 (as it is in group 17 of the periodic table)\nIn the ClO₄⁻ ion, the chlorine atom forms a single bond with each of the four oxygen atoms. So, there are 4 x 2 = 8 bonding electrons for the chlorine atom.\nNon-bonding electrons = 0 (as there are no lone pairs on the chlorine atom)\n\nNow, we can calculate the formal charge of the chlorine atom:\nFormal charge of Cl = (7) - (0) - 1/2(8) = 7 - 0 - 4 = +3\n\nHowever, we need to consider the negative charge of the perchlorate ion (ClO₄⁻). This extra negative charge is distributed among the atoms in the ion. Since there are four oxygen atoms, each oxygen atom will share 1/4 of the extra negative charge. Therefore, the formal charge of each oxygen atom will be:\n\nFormal charge of O = +1 - 1/4 = +3/4\n\nThe formal charge of the chlorine atom remains the same:\n\nFormal charge of Cl = +3\n\nIn summary, the formal charge of the oxygen atom in the perchlorate ion is +3/4, and the formal charge of the chlorine atom is +3."
