    "message_2": "To calculate the density of the potassium chloride solution, we can use the formula:\n\nDensity = mass/volume\n\nGiven the mass of the solution is 31.5 grams and the volume is 25.0 mL, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nDensity = 31.5 g / 25.0 mL\n\nDensity = 1.26 g/mL\n\nSo, the density of the potassium chloride solution at 25°C is 1.26 g/mL."
