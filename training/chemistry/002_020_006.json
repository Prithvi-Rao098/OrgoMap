    "message_1": "Which type of inorganic solid is KCl, NaCl and MgO? Ionic, covalent or metallic? Provide a brief explanation for your answer.",
    "message_2": "KCl, NaCl, and MgO are all examples of ionic solids. In these compounds, there is a transfer of electrons between the metal and non-metal atoms, resulting in the formation of positive and negative ions. These ions are held together by strong electrostatic forces, known as ionic bonds.\n\nIn KCl, potassium (K) loses one electron to become K+ and chlorine (Cl) gains one electron to become Cl-. In NaCl, sodium (Na) loses one electron to become Na+ and chlorine (Cl) gains one electron to become Cl-. In MgO, magnesium (Mg) loses two electrons to become Mg2+ and oxygen (O) gains two electrons to become O2-. In each case, the oppositely charged ions are attracted to each other, forming a lattice structure typical of ionic solids."
