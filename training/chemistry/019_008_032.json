    "message_2": "To calculate the standard electrode potential for the given redox reaction, we need to determine the oxidation and reduction half-reactions and their corresponding standard reduction potentials.\n\nThe given reaction is:\n2Fe²⁺(aq) + Cl₂(g) → 2Fe³⁺(aq) + 2Cl⁻(aq)\n\nFirst, we identify the oxidation and reduction half-reactions:\n\nOxidation half-reaction: Fe²⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + e⁻\nReduction half-reaction: Cl₂(g) + 2e⁻ → 2Cl⁻(aq)\n\nNow, we use the given standard reduction potentials:\n\nE°(Fe³⁺/Fe²⁺) = +0.771 V (given)\nE°(Cl₂/Cl⁻) = +1.36 V (given)\n\nSince the Fe²⁺ is being oxidized, we need to reverse the sign of its standard reduction potential to get the standard oxidation potential:\n\nE°(Fe²⁺/Fe³⁺) = -0.771 V\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard electrode potential (E°) for the overall redox reaction using the formula:\n\nE°(cell) = E°(reduction) + E°(oxidation)\n\nE°(cell) = E°(Cl₂/Cl⁻) + E°(Fe²⁺/Fe³⁺)\nE°(cell) = (+1.36 V) + (-0.771 V)\nE°(cell) = 0.589 V\n\nSo, the standard electrode potential for the given redox reaction is 0.589 V."
