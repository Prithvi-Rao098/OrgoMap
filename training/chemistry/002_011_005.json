    "message_2": "The molecular geometry of H2O (water) is bent or angular. This is because water has two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, and the oxygen atom is at the center with the two hydrogen atoms bonded to it. The oxygen atom also has two lone pairs of electrons, which repel the bonded hydrogen atoms, causing the bent shape.\n\nAs for polarity, H2O is a polar molecule. This is due to the difference in electronegativity between the oxygen and hydrogen atoms. Oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen, which means it attracts electrons more strongly. This causes an uneven distribution of electron density, resulting in a partial negative charge on the oxygen atom and partial positive charges on the hydrogen atoms. The bent molecular geometry further contributes to the polarity, as the dipole moments of the O-H bonds do not cancel each other out, leading to an overall molecular dipole moment."
