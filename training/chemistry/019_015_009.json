    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the fusion reaction between aluminum and oxygen, we need to use the following equation:\n\nΔH = n * ΔHf\n\nwhere ΔH is the standard enthalpy change, n is the number of moles of the product, and ΔHf is the standard enthalpy of formation of the product.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction between aluminum and oxygen to form aluminum oxide is:\n\n4 Al (s) + 3 O2 (g) → 2 Al2O3 (s)\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) for aluminum oxide (Al2O3) is -1675.7 kJ/mol.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of aluminum (Al) in 10 grams:\n\nMolar mass of Al = 26.98 g/mol\n\nmoles of Al = mass / molar mass\nmoles of Al = 10 g / 26.98 g/mol = 0.3707 mol\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 4 moles of Al react to form 2 moles of Al2O3. Therefore, we can find the moles of Al2O3 formed:\n\nmoles of Al2O3 = (0.3707 mol Al) * (2 mol Al2O3 / 4 mol Al) = 0.1854 mol Al2O3\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard enthalpy change (ΔH) for the reaction:\n\nΔH = n * ΔHf\nΔH = (0.1854 mol Al2O3) * (-1675.7 kJ/mol)\nΔH = -310.6 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the fusion reaction between aluminum and oxygen to form aluminum oxide when 10 grams of aluminum reacts completely with excess oxygen under standard conditions is approximately -310.6 kJ."
