    "message_2": "The VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) geometry of the molecule SF4 (sulfur tetrafluoride) can be determined by first analyzing its Lewis structure. \n\nSulfur (S) has 6 valence electrons, and each fluorine (F) atom has 7 valence electrons. In SF4, sulfur forms four bonds with four fluorine atoms, using 4 of its valence electrons. The remaining 2 valence electrons on sulfur form a lone pair.\n\nNow, we can determine the VSEPR geometry by considering the number of bonding electron pairs and lone pairs around the central atom (S). In SF4, there are 4 bonding electron pairs and 1 lone pair around the sulfur atom.\n\nAccording to the VSEPR theory, the electron pairs will arrange themselves to minimize repulsion. In the case of SF4, the electron pairs form a trigonal bipyramidal arrangement, with the lone pair occupying one of the equatorial positions. This results in a molecular geometry known as \"see-saw\" or \"distorted tetrahedron.\""
