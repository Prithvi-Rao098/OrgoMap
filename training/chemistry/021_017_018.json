Compare the IMF in water to those present in nonpolar substances like hexane or methane.",
    "message_2": "In a sample of water at room temperature, the primary type of intermolecular forces (IMF) present are hydrogen bonds. Hydrogen bonds are a type of dipole-dipole interaction that occurs when a hydrogen atom is covalently bonded to a highly electronegative atom (such as oxygen, nitrogen, or fluorine) and is attracted to another electronegative atom.\n\nThe presence of hydrogen bonds in water accounts for its unique properties, such as high boiling point, viscosity, and surface tension. The hydrogen bonds between water molecules create a strong cohesive force, which requires a significant amount of energy to break. This results in a high boiling point for water compared to other substances with similar molecular weights.\n\nThe viscosity of water is also influenced by hydrogen bonding. The strong intermolecular forces cause water molecules to \"stick\" together, creating resistance to flow. This resistance results in a higher viscosity compared to substances with weaker IMFs.\n\nSurface tension in water is a result of the strong hydrogen bonding between water molecules at the surface. These molecules are attracted to each other more strongly than they are to the air, causing them to form a \"skin\" on the surface. This surface tension allows water to form droplets and enables certain insects to \"walk\" on water.\n\nIn contrast, nonpolar substances like hexane or methane have weaker intermolecular forces, primarily London dispersion forces (also known as van der Waals forces). These forces are temporary, weak attractions between instantaneous dipoles that occur due to the random movement of electrons in the molecules. Since London dispersion forces are weaker than hydrogen bonds, nonpolar substances typically have lower boiling points, viscosities, and surface tensions compared to water."
