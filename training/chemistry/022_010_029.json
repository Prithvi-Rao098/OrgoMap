    "message_2": "To determine the mass of silver chloride formed, we can use the concept of stoichiometry. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction between silver nitrate (AgNO₃) and sodium chloride (NaCl) is:\n\nAgNO₃(aq) + NaCl(aq) → AgCl(s) + NaNO₃(aq)\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of AgNO₃ reacts with 1 mole of NaCl to produce 1 mole of AgCl. \n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of AgNO₃ and NaCl in the solutions:\n\nMoles of AgNO₃ = (Volume of AgNO₃ solution) × (Molarity of AgNO₃ solution)\nMoles of AgNO₃ = (50.0 mL) × (0.100 mol/L)\nMoles of AgNO₃ = 0.00500 mol\n\nMoles of NaCl = (Volume of NaCl solution) × (Molarity of NaCl solution)\nMoles of NaCl = (50.0 mL) × (0.100 mol/L)\nMoles of NaCl = 0.00500 mol\n\nSince the moles of AgNO₃ and NaCl are equal, the reaction will go to completion, and all of the AgNO₃ and NaCl will react to form AgCl.\n\nNow, we can find the mass of AgCl formed using the molar mass of AgCl (143.32 g/mol):\n\nMass of AgCl = (Moles of AgCl) × (Molar mass of AgCl)\nMass of AgCl = (0.00500 mol) × (143.32 g/mol)\nMass of AgCl = 0.7166 g\n\nTherefore, 0.7166 grams of silver chloride will be formed when 50.0 mL of 0.100 M silver nitrate solution is mixed with 50.0 mL of 0.100 M sodium chloride solution."
