    "message_2": "To calculate the yield of acetylsalicylic acid, we first need to determine the limiting reagent in the reaction. We can do this by comparing the moles of each reactant to the stoichiometry of the balanced chemical equation.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the synthesis of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is:\n\nC7H6O3 (salicylic acid) + C4H6O3 (acetic anhydride) â†’ C9H8O4 (acetylsalicylic acid) + C2H4O2 (acetic acid)\n\nThe molar masses of the compounds involved are:\n- Salicylic acid (C7H6O3): 138.12 g/mol\n- Acetic anhydride (C4H6O3): 102.09 g/mol\n- Acetylsalicylic acid (C9H8O4): 180.16 g/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the moles of each reactant:\n- Moles of salicylic acid = (5 g) / (138.12 g/mol) = 0.0362 mol\n- Moles of acetic anhydride = (10 g) / (102.09 g/mol) = 0.0979 mol\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, we can determine the limiting reagent by comparing the moles of each reactant. In this case, salicylic acid is the limiting reagent because it has fewer moles (0.0362 mol) than acetic anhydride (0.0979 mol).\n\nNow, we can calculate the theoretical yield of acetylsalicylic acid based on the moles of the limiting reagent (salicylic acid):\n\nTheoretical yield of acetylsalicylic acid = (0.0362 mol) * (180.16 g/mol) = 6.52 g\n\nAssuming complete conversion, the yield of acetylsalicylic acid obtained is 6.52 grams."
