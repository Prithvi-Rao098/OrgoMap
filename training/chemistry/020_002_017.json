    "message_1": "What is the equilibrium concentration of products and reactants for the chemical reaction: \n\n2 NO₂(g) ⇌ N₂O₄(g) \n\nif the initial concentration of NO₂ was 0.20 M and the equilibrium concentration of N₂O₄ was found to be 0.050 M?",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium concentration of the reactants and products, we can use the balanced chemical equation and the initial concentrations given. \n\nInitial concentrations:\n[NO₂] = 0.20 M\n[N₂O₄] = 0 M (since it is not mentioned)\n\nAt equilibrium:\n[N₂O₄] = 0.050 M\n\nLet x be the change in concentration of NO₂ at equilibrium. Since 2 moles of NO₂ react to form 1 mole of N₂O₄, the change in concentration of NO₂ will be 2x, and the change in concentration of N₂O₄ will be x.\n\nEquilibrium concentrations:\n[NO₂] = 0.20 M - 2x\n[N₂O₄] = 0.050 M + x\n\nNow, we can use the equilibrium expression for the reaction:\n\nKc = [N₂O₄] / [NO₂]^2\n\nWe need the value of Kc to solve for x. If Kc is not given, we cannot find the exact equilibrium concentrations. However, if Kc is provided, we can plug in the values and solve for x, and then find the equilibrium concentrations of NO₂ and N₂O₄."
