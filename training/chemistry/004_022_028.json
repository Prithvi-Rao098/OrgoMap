    "message_2": "A sodium-selective electrode is used to measure the concentration of sodium ions in a solution. In a 0.5M NaCl solution, the concentration of sodium ions (Na+) is equal to the concentration of chloride ions (Cl-), which is also 0.5M.\n\nSo, the concentration of sodium ions in a 0.5M NaCl solution is 0.5M."
