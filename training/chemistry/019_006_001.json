    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction, we can use the expression:\n\nKc = [NO]^2 * [Cl2] / [NOCl]^2\n\nThe problem states that at equilibrium, the concentrations are [NOCl] = 0.200 M, [NO] = 0.0250 M, and [Cl2] = 0.0250 M. We can plug these values into the Kc expression:\n\nKc = (0.0250)^2 * (0.0250) / (0.200)^2\n\nKc = 0.000625 * 0.0250 / 0.0400\n\nKc = 0.015625 / 0.0400\n\nKc ≈ 0.390625\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction at 298 K is approximately 0.391."
