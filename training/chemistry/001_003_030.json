    "message_2": "Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They have the same molecular formula and the same connectivity of atoms but differ in the spatial arrangement of atoms in three-dimensional space. Enantiomers have identical physical properties, such as boiling points, melting points, and solubilities, in achiral environments. However, they exhibit different behavior in the presence of other chiral molecules or chiral environments, such as their interaction with plane-polarized light and chiral receptors or enzymes.\n\nIt is important to note that enantiomers have the same physical properties in achiral environments, so it is not possible to provide an example of two enantiomers with different physical properties in such a context. However, we can discuss their different behavior in chiral environments.\n\nFor example, consider the enantiomers of the chiral molecule 2-butanol:\n\n(2R)-2-butanol and (2S)-2-butanol\n\nThese enantiomers have the same boiling point, melting point, and solubility in achiral environments. However, they rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions. (2R)-2-butanol rotates plane-polarized light in a clockwise direction (dextrorotatory), while (2S)-2-butanol rotates it in a counterclockwise direction (levorotatory).\n\nAnother example of enantiomers exhibiting different behavior in chiral environments is their interaction with chiral receptors or enzymes in biological systems. The enantiomers of a chiral drug may have different pharmacological effects due to their interaction with chiral biomolecules. For instance, the (S)-enantiomer of the drug ibuprofen is responsible for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects, while the (R)-enantiomer is less active and can even cause unwanted side effects.\n\nIn summary, enantiomers have identical physical properties in achiral environments but can exhibit different behavior in chiral environments, such as their interaction with plane-polarized light and chiral receptors or enzymes."
