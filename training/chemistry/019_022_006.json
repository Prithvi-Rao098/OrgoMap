    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction, we first need to determine the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH):\n\nHCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H2O(l)\n\nNext, we need to determine the limiting reactant. To do this, we can calculate the moles of each reactant:\n\nmoles of HCl = volume (L) × concentration (M) = 0.025 L × 0.2 M = 0.005 mol\nmoles of NaOH = volume (L) × concentration (M) = 0.03 L × 0.15 M = 0.0045 mol\n\nSince there are fewer moles of NaOH, it is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow, we can use the standard enthalpy of formation values for the reactants and products to calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nΔH° = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants)\n\nFor this reaction, the standard enthalpy of formation for NaCl(aq) is -407 kJ/mol, and for H2O(l) is -285.8 kJ/mol. The standard enthalpy of formation for HCl(aq) is -167.2 kJ/mol, and for NaOH(aq) is -469.15 kJ/mol.\n\nΔH° = [(-407 + (-285.8)) - ((-167.2) + (-469.15))] kJ/mol\n\nΔH° = (-692.8 - (-636.35)) kJ/mol\n\nΔH° = -56.45 kJ/mol\n\nSince NaOH is the limiting reactant, we need to multiply the enthalpy change per mole by the moles of the limiting reactant to find the total enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nΔH = -56.45 kJ/mol × 0.0045 mol = -0.254 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the reaction of 25.0 mL of 0.2 M hydrochloric acid with 30.0 mL of 0.15 M sodium hydroxide is approximately -0.254 kJ."
