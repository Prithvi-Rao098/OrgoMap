    "message_2": "The compound C6H5CH2CH2OH is known as phenethyl alcohol. It contains the following functional groups:\n\n1. Aromatic ring (Phenyl group): C6H5\n2. Aliphatic chain: CH2CH2\n3. Alcohol group: OH\n\nWhen phenethyl alcohol reacts with hydrochloric acid (HCl), the alcohol group (-OH) will be protonated, and a substitution reaction will occur, replacing the -OH group with a -Cl group. The product of this reaction will be phenethyl chloride (C6H5CH2CH2Cl) and water (H2O).\n\nReaction: C6H5CH2CH2OH + HCl â†’ C6H5CH2CH2Cl + H2O"
