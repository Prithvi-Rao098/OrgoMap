    "message_2": "The Lewis structure of carbon dioxide (CO2) consists of a carbon atom (C) double bonded to two oxygen atoms (O). Here's a representation of the structure:\n\nO = C = O\n\nIn this structure, the carbon atom shares two pairs of electrons with each oxygen atom, forming two double bonds. The carbon atom has a total of four valence electrons, while each oxygen atom has six valence electrons. By forming double bonds, all atoms achieve a stable octet configuration (eight electrons in their outermost shell)."
