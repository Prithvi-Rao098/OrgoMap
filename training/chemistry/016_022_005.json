    "message_2": "To find the enthalpy change of isomerization, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH_isomerization = ΔH_f (product) - ΔH_f (reactant)\n\nwhere ΔH_f is the standard enthalpy of formation.\n\nIn this case, the reactant is cyclohexene and the product is cis-1,2-dimethylcyclohexene. We are given their standard enthalpies of formation:\n\nΔH_f (cyclohexene) = -39.0 kJ/mol\nΔH_f (cis-1,2-dimethylcyclohexene) = -133.0 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔH_isomerization = (-133.0 kJ/mol) - (-39.0 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH_isomerization = -94.0 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the enthalpy change of isomerization for cyclohexene to its cis-1,2-dimethylcyclohexene isomer is -94.0 kJ/mol."
