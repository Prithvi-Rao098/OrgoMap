Given the following information: The sample was irradiated with neutrons for 15 minutes producing 4.1 x 10^13 gold nuclei. The decay constant for the gold isotope is 2.3 x 10^-6 s^-1 and the efficiency of the detection system is 8.5%. The mass of the sample is 10.0 grams.",
    "message_2": "To find the concentration of gold in the sample, we need to first determine the number of gold atoms in the sample. We can do this using the decay constant and the number of gold nuclei produced during irradiation.\n\nThe decay equation is:\n\nN(t) = N0 * e^(-λt)\n\nWhere N(t) is the number of gold nuclei at time t, N0 is the initial number of gold nuclei, λ is the decay constant, and t is the time in seconds.\n\nWe are given that the sample was irradiated for 15 minutes, which is equivalent to 900 seconds. We are also given the decay constant (λ) and the number of gold nuclei produced (N0).\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of gold nuclei remaining after the irradiation:\n\nN(900) = (4.1 x 10^13) * e^(-2.3 x 10^-6 * 900)\n\nN(900) ≈ 4.1 x 10^13 * e^(-2.07)\n\nN(900) ≈ 4.1 x 10^13 * 0.126\n\nN(900) ≈ 5.166 x 10^12\n\nNow, we need to account for the efficiency of the detection system, which is 8.5%. This means that only 8.5% of the gold nuclei were detected:\n\nDetected gold nuclei = 5.166 x 10^12 * 0.085\n\nDetected gold nuclei ≈ 4.391 x 10^11\n\nNow, we can find the concentration of gold in the sample. The atomic mass of gold is approximately 197 g/mol. To find the number of moles of gold in the sample, we can use Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol):\n\nMoles of gold = (4.391 x 10^11 atoms) / (6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol)\n\nMoles of gold ≈ 7.29 x 10^-13 mol\n\nFinally, we can find the mass of gold in the sample by multiplying the moles of gold by the atomic mass of gold:\n\nMass of gold = (7.29 x 10^-13 mol) * (197 g/mol)\n\nMass of gold ≈ 1.436 x 10^-10 g\n\nNow, we can find the concentration of gold in the sample by dividing the mass of gold by the mass of the sample:\n\nConcentration of gold = (1.436 x 10^-10 g) / (10.0 g)\n\nConcentration of gold ≈ 1.436 x 10^-11 g/g\n\nSo, the concentration of gold in the sample is approximately 1.436 x 10^-11 g/g or 14.36 ppb (parts per billion)."
