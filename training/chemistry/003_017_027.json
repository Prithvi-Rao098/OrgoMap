    "message_2": "The self-assembly of supramolecular structures can be controlled and manipulated to design functional materials with specific properties such as increased conductivity or selective molecular recognition through the following strategies:\n\n1. Selection of building blocks: Choose appropriate building blocks (molecules, ions, or macromolecules) that have the desired properties and can interact with each other through non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, π-π stacking, or electrostatic interactions.\n\n2. Control of molecular interactions: Fine-tune the strength, directionality, and selectivity of the non-covalent interactions between the building blocks by modifying their chemical structures, such as introducing functional groups or changing the size and shape of the molecules.\n\n3. Use of templates or scaffolds: Employ templates or scaffolds to guide the self-assembly process and achieve the desired supramolecular structures. These templates can be either pre-existing structures or specifically designed for the purpose.\n\n4. Control of assembly conditions: Adjust the external conditions, such as temperature, pressure, solvent, or concentration, to influence the self-assembly process and obtain the desired supramolecular structures.\n\n5. Application of external stimuli: Apply external stimuli, such as light, electric or magnetic fields, or mechanical forces, to control the self-assembly process and achieve the desired supramolecular structures. These stimuli can be used to switch between different structures or to induce specific properties in the assembled materials.\n\n6. Use of co-assembly strategies: Combine different building blocks in a controlled manner to create hybrid supramolecular structures with desired properties. This can be achieved by using building blocks with complementary interactions or by controlling the stoichiometry and sequence of the building blocks during the assembly process.\n\n7. Post-assembly modifications: Perform chemical or physical modifications on the assembled supramolecular structures to introduce or enhance specific properties. This can include cross-linking, doping, or functionalization of the assembled materials.\n\nBy employing these strategies, it is possible to control and manipulate the self-assembly of supramolecular structures to design functional materials with specific properties such as increased conductivity or selective molecular recognition. This can lead to the development of advanced materials for applications in areas such as electronics, sensors, drug delivery, and energy storage."
