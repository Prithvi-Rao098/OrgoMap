    "message_2": "As a chemist, I cannot physically perform the experiment, but I can guide you through the process of using infrared (IR) spectroscopy to characterize the functional groups present in a compound labeled as unknown X.\n\n1. Obtain the IR spectrum of unknown X:\nFirst, you need to prepare a sample of unknown X for IR spectroscopy. This can be done by creating a thin film of the compound on a salt plate or by mixing it with an inert solid like potassium bromide (KBr) and pressing it into a pellet. Then, run the IR spectrometer to obtain the spectrum of unknown X.\n\n2. Analyze the IR spectrum of unknown X:\nExamine the IR spectrum of unknown X and take note of the significant peaks and their corresponding wavenumbers (cm⁻¹). These peaks represent the vibrational frequencies of the functional groups present in the compound.\n\n3. Compare the IR spectrum of unknown X with known spectra:\nCompare the significant peaks in the IR spectrum of unknown X with the characteristic peaks of known functional groups. Here are some common functional groups and their corresponding IR peak ranges:\n\n- O-H (alcohol or phenol): Broad peak around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹\n- N-H (amine or amide): Sharp peak around 3100-3500 cm⁻¹\n- C-H (alkane): Peaks around 2800-3000 cm⁻¹\n- C=C (alkene): Peaks around 1600-1680 cm⁻¹\n- C≡C (alkyne): Peaks around 2100-2260 cm⁻¹\n- C=O (carbonyl group): Sharp peak around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹\n- C-O (ether or ester): Peaks around 1000-1300 cm⁻¹\n- C-N (amine or amide): Peaks around 1100-1360 cm⁻¹\n\n4. Identify the functional groups present in unknown X:\nBased on the comparison of the IR spectrum of unknown X with the known spectra, identify the functional groups present in the compound. For example, if you observe a broad peak around 3300 cm⁻¹ and a sharp peak around 1720 cm⁻¹, the compound likely contains an alcohol (O-H) and a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\nRemember that some functional groups may overlap or have similar peak ranges, so it is essential to consider the entire spectrum and the relative intensities of the peaks when identifying the functional groups in unknown X."
