    "message_2": "To determine the molecular geometry of CCl4 (carbon tetrachloride), we need to first draw its Lewis structure and then use the VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) theory to predict the geometry.\n\nStep 1: Draw the Lewis structure\nCarbon has 4 valence electrons, and each chlorine atom has 7 valence electrons. So, there are a total of 4 + (4 * 7) = 32 valence electrons in the CCl4 molecule. The Lewis structure of CCl4 is:\n\n          Cl\n           |\n          C-Cl\n           |\n          Cl\n\nIn this structure, carbon is the central atom, and it forms four single bonds with four chlorine atoms. There are no lone pairs on the central carbon atom.\n\nStep 2: Determine the electron domain geometry\nThe electron domain geometry is determined by the number of electron domains (bonding and non-bonding electron pairs) around the central atom. In CCl4, there are four bonding electron domains (single bonds) and no lone pairs on the central carbon atom. Thus, the electron domain geometry is tetrahedral.\n\nStep 3: Determine the molecular geometry\nSince there are no lone pairs on the central carbon atom, the molecular geometry is the same as the electron domain geometry, which is tetrahedral.\n\nIn summary, the molecular geometry of CCl4 is tetrahedral, with bond angles of approximately 109.5 degrees. This geometry results from the repulsion between the electron domains around the central carbon atom, which arrange themselves to minimize repulsion and maintain the maximum distance from each other."
