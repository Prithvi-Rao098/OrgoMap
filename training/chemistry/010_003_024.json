    "message_1": "Calculate the standard Gibbs free energy change for the reaction that occurs when a cell consisting of a nickel electrode and a silver electrode is connected, given that the nickel electrode is immersed in a solution containing 0.010 M Ni2+ ions and the silver electrode is immersed in a solution containing 0.20 M Ag+ ions. The standard reduction potential for the Ni2+/Ni half-cell is -0.25 V and for the Ag+/Ag half-cell is +0.80 V.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard Gibbs free energy change, we first need to determine the cell potential (E_cell) under non-standard conditions using the Nernst equation:\n\nE_cell = E°_cell - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\n\nwhere E°_cell is the standard cell potential, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin (assuming 298 K), n is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the redox reaction, F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol), and Q is the reaction quotient.\n\nFirst, let's find the standard cell potential (E°_cell):\n\nE°_cell = E°_cathode - E°_anode\nE°_cell = (+0.80 V) - (-0.25 V) = 1.05 V\n\nNow, let's find the reaction quotient (Q):\n\nQ = [Ni2+]/[Ag+]\nQ = (0.010 M)/(0.20 M) = 0.05\n\nThe balanced redox reaction is:\n\nNi2+ + 2Ag → Ni + 2Ag+\n\nSo, n = 2 moles of electrons are transferred in the reaction.\n\nNow, we can use the Nernst equation to find E_cell:\n\nE_cell = 1.05 V - (8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K) / (2 * 96,485 C/mol) * ln(0.05)\nE_cell = 1.05 V - (0.0257 V) * ln(0.05)\nE_cell ≈ 1.05 V - (0.0257 V) * (-2.9957)\nE_cell ≈ 1.05 V + 0.077 V\nE_cell ≈ 1.127 V\n\nFinally, we can calculate the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) using the following equation:\n\nΔG = -nFE_cell\n\nΔG = -2 * 96,485 C/mol * 1.127 V\nΔG ≈ -217,000 J/mol\n\nSo, the standard Gibbs free energy change for the reaction is approximately -217 kJ/mol."
