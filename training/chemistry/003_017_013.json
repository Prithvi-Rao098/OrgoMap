    "message_2": "The molecular structure plays a crucial role in the self-assembly process in supramolecular chemistry. Self-assembly is the spontaneous organization of molecules into well-defined structures or patterns through non-covalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, π-π interactions, and electrostatic interactions. The molecular structure determines the types and strengths of these interactions, which in turn dictate the resulting supramolecular architectures and their properties.\n\nHere are some specific examples and the underlying principles behind the observed behavior:\n\n1. Hydrogen bonding: The presence of hydrogen bond donors (e.g., -OH, -NH) and acceptors (e.g., -C=O, -N) in a molecular structure can lead to the formation of supramolecular structures through hydrogen bonding. For example, in the case of guanosine derivatives, the presence of multiple hydrogen bond donors and acceptors allows the formation of G-quartets, which can further stack to form G-quadruplex structures.\n\n2. π-π interactions: Molecules with extended π-conjugated systems, such as aromatic rings, can interact with each other through π-π stacking. This interaction is particularly important in the self-assembly of organic electronic materials, such as conjugated polymers and small molecules used in organic solar cells and transistors. For example, the self-assembly of perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives can lead to the formation of one-dimensional nanofibers or two-dimensional nanosheets, depending on the molecular structure and the presence of additional functional groups.\n\n3. Amphiphilic molecules: Molecules with both hydrophilic (water-loving) and hydrophobic (water-hating) parts can self-assemble in water to form various structures, such as micelles, vesicles, and bilayers. This behavior is the basis for the formation of biological membranes and the self-assembly of surfactants and block copolymers. For example, phospholipids, which have a hydrophilic head group and hydrophobic fatty acid chains, can spontaneously form bilayer structures in water, which are the basis of cell membranes.\n\n4. Metal-ligand coordination: The presence of metal-binding sites in a molecular structure can lead to the formation of supramolecular structures through metal-ligand coordination. For example, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of porous materials formed by the self-assembly of metal ions or clusters and organic ligands. The choice of metal ions and ligands, as well as their connectivity, can lead to a wide variety of MOF structures with different pore sizes, shapes, and functionalities.\n\n5. Electrostatic interactions: Molecules with charged groups can interact with each other through electrostatic interactions, leading to the formation of supramolecular structures. For example, the self-assembly of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes can result in the formation of polyelectrolyte complexes, which have applications in drug delivery and gene therapy.\n\nIn summary, the molecular structure plays a critical role in the self-assembly process in supramolecular chemistry by determining the types and strengths of non-covalent interactions. By carefully designing the molecular structure, chemists can control the resulting supramolecular architectures and their properties, leading to a wide range of applications in materials science, biology, and nanotechnology."
