    "message_2": "The Arrhenius equation is given by:\n\nk = Ae^(-Ea/RT)\n\nwhere k is the rate constant, A is the pre-exponential factor, Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nWe are given two sets of data: k1 = 0.005 s^-1 at T1 = 25°C (298.15 K) and k2 = 0.01 s^-1 at T2 = 35°C (308.15 K). We can set up two equations using the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk1 = Ae^(-Ea/RT1)\nk2 = Ae^(-Ea/RT2)\n\nNow, we can divide the first equation by the second equation to eliminate the pre-exponential factor A:\n\nk1/k2 = e^(-Ea/RT1) / e^(-Ea/RT2)\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(k1/k2) = ln(e^(-Ea/RT1) / e^(-Ea/RT2))\n\nUsing the property of logarithms, we can simplify the equation:\n\nln(k1/k2) = (-Ea/RT1) - (-Ea/RT2)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values for k1, k2, T1, and T2:\n\nln(0.005/0.01) = (-Ea/(8.314*298.15)) - (-Ea/(8.314*308.15))\n\nSolve for Ea:\n\nln(1/2) = (Ea/(8.314*308.15)) - (Ea/(8.314*298.15))\n\nEa = (ln(1/2) * 8.314 * 298.15 * 308.15) / (308.15 - 298.15)\n\nEa ≈ 5233.6 J/mol\n\nThe activation energy for the first-order reaction is approximately 5233.6 J/mol."
