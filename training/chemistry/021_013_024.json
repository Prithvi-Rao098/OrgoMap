    "message_2": "The Lewis structure of a methane molecule (CH4) consists of a central carbon atom surrounded by four hydrogen atoms. The carbon atom has four valence electrons, and each hydrogen atom has one valence electron. In the Lewis structure, the carbon atom forms four single covalent bonds with the four hydrogen atoms, sharing one electron from each hydrogen atom. This results in a total of eight electrons (four pairs) being shared in the molecule, fulfilling the octet rule for the carbon atom and the duet rule for each hydrogen atom.\n\nThe Lewis structure can be represented as:\n\n       H\n       |\n    H--C--H\n       |\n       H"
