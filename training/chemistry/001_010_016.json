    "message_2": "The nucleophilic addition reaction of methanol with propanal involves the following steps:\n\n1. Protonation of the carbonyl oxygen: Methanol (CH3OH) acts as a weak acid and donates a proton (H+) to the carbonyl oxygen of propanal (CH3CH2CHO). This increases the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon, making it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack.\n\n2. Nucleophilic attack: The oxygen atom in methanol, which has a lone pair of electrons, acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of protonated propanal. This results in the formation of an intermediate tetrahedral species.\n\n3. Deprotonation: The intermediate tetrahedral species loses a proton (H+) to a nearby methanol molecule, which acts as a base. This step generates the final product and regenerates the methanol molecule.\n\nThe product obtained from the nucleophilic addition reaction of methanol with propanal is 1-methoxypropan-2-ol (CH3CH(OCH3)CH2OH). This compound is also known as a hemiacetal, which is formed by the addition of an alcohol to an aldehyde."
