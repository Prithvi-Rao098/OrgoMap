    "message_2": "The VSEPR geometry of NH3 (ammonia) molecule is trigonal pyramidal. In ammonia, nitrogen has three bonding pairs of electrons with three hydrogen atoms and one lone pair of electrons. According to the VSEPR theory, the repulsion between the lone pair and the bonding pairs causes the molecule to adopt a trigonal pyramidal shape."
