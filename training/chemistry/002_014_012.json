    "message_2": "To calculate the formal charge on the nitrogen atom in the ammonium ion (NH4+), we can use the following formula:\n\nFormal charge = (Valence electrons of the atom) - (Non-bonding electrons) - (1/2 x Bonding electrons)\n\nFor nitrogen (N), the number of valence electrons is 5. In the ammonium ion, nitrogen is bonded to four hydrogen atoms, and each bond consists of 2 electrons. There are no non-bonding electrons (lone pairs) on the nitrogen atom in this case.\n\nNow, let's plug the values into the formula:\n\nFormal charge = (5) - (0) - (1/2 x 8)\nFormal charge = 5 - 0 - 4\nFormal charge = +1\n\nThe formal charge on the nitrogen atom in the ammonium ion (NH4+) is +1. Since the formal charge is positive, the ion is a positive ion (cation)."
