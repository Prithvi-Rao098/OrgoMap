    "message_2": "To identify the unit cell geometry, we need to analyze the given lattice parameters:\n\na = 5.14 Å\nb = 5.14 Å\nc = 5.14 Å\nα = 90°\nβ = 90°\nγ = 120°\n\nSince all the lattice parameters a, b, and c are equal and the angles α and β are 90°, while γ is 120°, this crystal structure corresponds to a hexagonal unit cell.\n\nIn a hexagonal unit cell, there are three types of lattice points: one at each corner of the hexagon, one at the center of the hexagon, and two at the center of the top and bottom faces. The number of atoms in the unit cell can be calculated as follows:\n\n- There are 12 corner atoms, but each corner atom is shared by 6 unit cells. So, the contribution of corner atoms to the unit cell is (12 * 1/6) = 2 atoms.\n- There is 1 center atom, which is completely inside the unit cell. So, the contribution of the center atom is 1 atom.\n- There are 2 face-centered atoms (top and bottom), but each face-centered atom is shared by 2 unit cells. So, the contribution of face-centered atoms is (2 * 1/2) = 1 atom.\n\nAdding up the contributions from corner atoms, center atom, and face-centered atoms, we get:\n\nNumber of atoms in the unit cell = 2 (corner atoms) + 1 (center atom) + 1 (face-centered atoms) = 4 atoms."
