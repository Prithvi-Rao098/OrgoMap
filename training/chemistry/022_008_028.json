    "message_2": "When zinc metal is added to a solution of copper sulfate, a single replacement reaction occurs. In this reaction, zinc displaces copper from copper sulfate, forming zinc sulfate and copper metal. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nZn (s) + CuSO4 (aq) â†’ ZnSO4 (aq) + Cu (s)\n\nThis is a single replacement (also known as single displacement) reaction, where one element (zinc) replaces another element (copper) in a compound."
