    "message_2": "Glutamine is synthesized in the body through a process called glutamine synthetase reaction. This process involves the conversion of glutamate, an amino acid, into glutamine. The enzyme responsible for this conversion is called glutamine synthetase. The reaction occurs in two steps:\n\n1. In the first step, glutamate reacts with ATP (adenosine triphosphate) to form a phosphorylated intermediate called glutamyl phosphate. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme glutamine synthetase and releases ADP (adenosine diphosphate).\n\n2. In the second step, an amide group from ammonia (NH3) is transferred to the glutamyl phosphate, forming glutamine and inorganic phosphate (Pi). This step is also catalyzed by the enzyme glutamine synthetase.\n\nThe overall reaction can be summarized as follows:\n\nGlutamate + ATP + NH3 â†’ Glutamine + ADP + Pi\n\nGlutamine plays a crucial role in nitrogen metabolism in the body. It serves as a nitrogen donor for the synthesis of various biomolecules, such as nucleotides, amino sugars, and other amino acids. Glutamine is also involved in the regulation of acid-base balance in the body by transporting ammonia, which is a toxic byproduct of nitrogen metabolism.\n\nIn addition, glutamine acts as a primary fuel source for rapidly dividing cells, such as immune cells and intestinal cells. It also plays a role in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal barrier and supports immune function.\n\nIn summary, glutamine is synthesized in the body through the glutamine synthetase reaction, which converts glutamate into glutamine. Its primary role in nitrogen metabolism is to serve as a nitrogen donor for the synthesis of various biomolecules and to help regulate acid-base balance by transporting ammonia."
