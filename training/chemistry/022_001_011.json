    "message_2": "To balance the chemical equation for the reaction between potassium permanganate (KMnO4) and sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) in acidic solution, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the oxidation and reduction half-reactions.\n2. Balance the atoms in each half-reaction.\n3. Balance the charges in each half-reaction.\n4. Multiply the half-reactions by appropriate factors to equalize the number of electrons transferred.\n5. Add the half-reactions and simplify.\n\nStep 1: Identify the oxidation and reduction half-reactions.\n\nKMnO4 (in acidic solution) is reduced to Mn2+, and Na2SO3 is oxidized to Na2SO4.\n\nReduction half-reaction: MnO4- + 8H+ + 5e- → Mn2+ + 4H2O\nOxidation half-reaction: SO3^2- → SO4^2- + 2e-\n\nStep 2: Balance the atoms in each half-reaction.\n\nThe atoms are already balanced in both half-reactions.\n\nStep 3: Balance the charges in each half-reaction.\n\nThe charges are already balanced in both half-reactions.\n\nStep 4: Multiply the half-reactions by appropriate factors to equalize the number of electrons transferred.\n\nTo equalize the number of electrons transferred, multiply the reduction half-reaction by 2 and the oxidation half-reaction by 5.\n\n2(MnO4- + 8H+ + 5e- → Mn2+ + 4H2O)\n5(SO3^2- → SO4^2- + 2e-)\n\nStep 5: Add the half-reactions and simplify.\n\n2MnO4- + 16H+ + 10e- + 5SO3^2- → 2Mn2+ + 8H2O + 5SO4^2- + 10e-\n\nCancel out the electrons:\n\n2MnO4- + 16H+ + 5SO3^2- → 2Mn2+ + 8H2O + 5SO4^2-\n\nNow, add the spectator ions (K+ and Na+) to complete the balanced equation:\n\n2KMnO4 + 16H+ + 5Na2SO3 → 2Mn2+ + 8H2O + 5Na2SO4 + 2K+\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction between potassium permanganate (KMnO4) and sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) in acidic solution is:\n\n2KMnO4 + 16H+ + 5Na2SO3 → 2Mn2+ + 8H2O + 5Na2SO4 + 2K+"
