    "message_2": "The redox reaction between copper metal and silver ion can be represented as follows:\n\nCu(s) + 2Ag⁺(aq) → Cu²⁺(aq) + 2Ag(s)\n\nIn this reaction, copper metal (Cu) loses 2 electrons to become Cu²⁺, while each silver ion (Ag⁺) gains 1 electron to become Ag. \n\nSince there are 0.05 moles of copper metal and 0.1 moles of silver ions, the reaction will proceed as follows:\n\n0.05 moles Cu × (2 moles Ag⁺ / 1 mole Cu) = 0.1 moles Ag⁺\n\nThis means that all the copper metal and silver ions will react completely.\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of electrons transferred:\n\nFor copper:\n0.05 moles Cu × (2 electrons / 1 mole Cu) = 0.1 moles of electrons\n\nFor silver:\n0.1 moles Ag⁺ × (1 electron / 1 mole Ag⁺) = 0.1 moles of electrons\n\nSince both copper and silver have the same number of moles of electrons transferred, the total number of electrons transferred during the redox reaction is:\n\n0.1 moles of electrons × (6.022 x 10²³ electrons / 1 mole of electrons) ≈ 6.022 x 10²² electrons"
