    "message_2": "To calculate the entropy change for a monatomic ideal gas during an isothermal expansion, we can use the formula:\n\nΔS = n * R * ln(V2/V1)\n\nwhere:\nΔS is the entropy change,\nn is the number of moles of the gas,\nR is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K),\nV1 is the initial volume,\nV2 is the final volume, and\nT is the temperature (in Kelvin).\n\nSince the process is isothermal, the temperature T remains constant throughout the expansion. Note that this formula is derived from the equation for the entropy change of an ideal gas during a reversible isothermal process."
