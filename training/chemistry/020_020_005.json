    "message_2": "To calculate the change in the equilibrium constant, we can use the van't Hoff equation:\n\nln(K2/K1) = -ΔH°/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere K1 and K2 are the equilibrium constants at temperatures T1 and T2, ΔH° is the standard enthalpy change, and R is the gas constant (8.314 J/K mol).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin:\nT1 = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\nT2 = 35°C + 273.15 = 308.15 K\n\nNext, we need to convert the standard enthalpy change from kJ/mol to J/mol:\nΔH° = -29 kJ/mol * 1000 J/kJ = -29000 J/mol\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the van't Hoff equation:\n\nln(K2/K1) = -(-29000 J/mol) / (8.314 J/K mol) * (1/308.15 K - 1/298.15 K)\n\nln(K2/K1) = 29000 / 8.314 * (0.003246 - 0.003355)\nln(K2/K1) = 3485.6 * (-0.000109)\nln(K2/K1) = -0.379\n\nNow, we can solve for K2:\n\nK2 = K1 * e^(-0.379)\n\nSince we are interested in the change in the equilibrium constant, we can express the change as a ratio:\n\nK2/K1 = e^(-0.379)\n\nK2/K1 ≈ 0.684\n\nThe equilibrium constant at 35°C (K2) is approximately 0.684 times the equilibrium constant at 25°C (K1). This means that the equilibrium constant has decreased when the temperature is increased from 25°C to 35°C."
