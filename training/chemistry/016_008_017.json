    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat required to melt 25 grams of ice at 0°C, we will use the following equation:\n\nq = n * ΔHf\n\nwhere q is the heat required, n is the number of moles of ice, and ΔHf is the enthalpy of fusion of ice.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of ice. The molar mass of water (H2O) is 18.015 g/mol. \n\nn = mass / molar mass\nn = 25 g / 18.015 g/mol\nn ≈ 1.387 moles\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat required:\n\nq = n * ΔHf\nq = 1.387 moles * 6.01 kJ/mol\nq ≈ 8.34 kJ\n\nTherefore, the amount of heat required to melt 25 grams of ice at 0°C is approximately 8.34 kJ."
