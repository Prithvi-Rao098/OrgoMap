    "message_2": "To calculate the lattice energy of CaO, we can use the Born-Haber cycle, which relates the lattice energy to other known thermodynamic quantities. The lattice energy (U) can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nΔHf = U + IE(Ca) + EA(O) - E(Ca2+ → Ca) - E(O2- → O)\n\nWhere:\nΔHf = enthalpy of formation of CaO = -635 kJ/mol\nIE(Ca) = ionization energy of Ca = 590 kJ/mol\nEA(O) = electron affinity of O = -141 kJ/mol\nE(Ca2+ → Ca) = energy required to remove 2 electrons from Ca\nE(O2- → O) = energy required to add 2 electrons to O\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the energy required to remove 2 electrons from Ca and the energy required to add 2 electrons to O. Since the ionization energy of Ca is given for the removal of 1 electron, we will assume that the energy required to remove 2 electrons is twice the ionization energy:\n\nE(Ca2+ → Ca) = 2 * IE(Ca) = 2 * 590 kJ/mol = 1180 kJ/mol\n\nSince the electron affinity of O is given for the addition of 1 electron, we will assume that the energy required to add 2 electrons is twice the electron affinity:\n\nE(O2- → O) = 2 * EA(O) = 2 * (-141 kJ/mol) = -282 kJ/mol\n\nNow we can plug these values into the equation:\n\n-635 kJ/mol = U + 590 kJ/mol - 141 kJ/mol - 1180 kJ/mol + 282 kJ/mol\n\nSolving for U (lattice energy):\n\nU = -635 kJ/mol - 590 kJ/mol + 141 kJ/mol + 1180 kJ/mol - 282 kJ/mol\nU = -3424 kJ/mol + 141 kJ/mol + 1180 kJ/mol - 282 kJ/mol\nU = -3424 kJ/mol + 1039 kJ/mol\nU = -2385 kJ/mol\n\nThe lattice energy of CaO is approximately -2385 kJ/mol."
