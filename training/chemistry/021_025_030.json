    "message_2": "To identify the type of bonding present in a sample of sodium chloride (NaCl), we can use a combination of experimental techniques and theoretical knowledge.\n\n1. Theoretical knowledge:\nSodium (Na) is a metal from Group 1 of the periodic table, and Chlorine (Cl) is a non-metal from Group 17. When a metal and a non-metal react, they tend to form an ionic bond. In this case, sodium loses one electron to achieve a stable electron configuration, and chlorine gains one electron to achieve a stable electron configuration. This transfer of electrons results in the formation of positively charged sodium ions (Na+) and negatively charged chloride ions (Cl-). These ions are attracted to each other due to electrostatic forces, forming an ionic bond.\n\n2. Experimental techniques:\na) Melting point and boiling point: Ionic compounds typically have high melting and boiling points due to the strong electrostatic forces between the ions. Experimentally, sodium chloride has a high melting point (801°C) and boiling point (1413°C), which supports the presence of ionic bonding.\n\nb) Solubility in water: Ionic compounds generally dissolve in polar solvents like water. Sodium chloride is highly soluble in water, which is consistent with ionic bonding.\n\nc) Electrical conductivity: Ionic compounds conduct electricity when dissolved in water or in a molten state, as the ions are free to move and carry charge. Experimentally, sodium chloride conducts electricity when dissolved in water or in its molten state, which is another indication of ionic bonding.\n\nd) X-ray diffraction: This technique can be used to determine the crystal structure of a compound. Sodium chloride forms a characteristic face-centered cubic crystal lattice, which is typical of ionic compounds.\n\nIn conclusion, based on theoretical knowledge and experimental techniques, the type of bonding present in a sample of sodium chloride (NaCl) is ionic bonding."
