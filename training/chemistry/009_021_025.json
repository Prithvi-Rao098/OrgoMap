    "message_2": "Nuclear medicine can be used to treat cancer through a method called radiation therapy, which involves using ionizing radiation to target and destroy cancer cells. This can be done using external beam radiation therapy or internal radiation therapy (also known as brachytherapy). There are several types of radioactive isotopes and treatment methods used in radiation therapy for cancer patients:\n\n1. External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT): In this method, a machine called a linear accelerator is used to generate high-energy radiation beams that are directed at the tumor from outside the body. The most common type of EBRT is X-ray therapy, which uses photons (X-rays) to deliver radiation. Another type of EBRT is proton therapy, which uses protons (positively charged particles) to target cancer cells.\n\n2. Brachytherapy: This method involves placing radioactive isotopes directly into or near the tumor. The isotopes emit radiation that destroys the cancer cells while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissue. Some common radioactive isotopes used in brachytherapy include:\n\n   a. Iodine-125 (I-125): Used to treat prostate cancer, brain tumors, and eye tumors.\n   b. Cesium-131 (Cs-131): Used for prostate cancer and gynecological cancers.\n   c. Palladium-103 (Pd-103): Used for prostate cancer.\n   d. Iridium-192 (Ir-192): Used for various types of cancer, including breast, cervical, and head and neck cancers.\n\n3. Radioimmunotherapy: This method combines radiation therapy with immunotherapy, using radioactive isotopes attached to antibodies that specifically target cancer cells. The antibodies deliver the isotopes directly to the tumor, allowing for a more targeted and effective treatment. Common isotopes used in radioimmunotherapy include:\n\n   a. Yttrium-90 (Y-90): Used in the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and liver cancer.\n   b. Iodine-131 (I-131): Used for the treatment of thyroid cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n\n4. Radiopharmaceuticals: These are radioactive drugs that can be administered orally or intravenously to target specific cancer cells. The radiopharmaceuticals emit radiation that destroys the cancer cells while minimizing damage to healthy tissue. Examples of radiopharmaceuticals include:\n\n   a. Radium-223 (Ra-223): Used for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer that has spread to the bones.\n   b. Lutetium-177 (Lu-177): Used for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors.\n\nThese treatment methods can be used alone or in combination with other cancer treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy, depending on the type and stage of cancer. The choice of radioactive isotopes and treatment methods depends on various factors, including the location, size, and type of tumor, as well as the patient's overall health and preferences."
