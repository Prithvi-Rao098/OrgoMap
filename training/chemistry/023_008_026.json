    "message_2": "To determine the minimum amount of nitric acid required, we need to first find the number of moles of p-nitroaniline and aniline, and then use the molar yield to find the moles of nitric acid needed. Finally, we'll convert the moles of nitric acid to volume in mL.\n\n1. Calculate the moles of p-nitroaniline:\nMolar mass of p-nitroaniline = 138.12 g/mol (C6H6N2O2)\nGiven mass of p-nitroaniline = 25 g\n\nmoles of p-nitroaniline = mass / molar mass\nmoles of p-nitroaniline = 25 g / 138.12 g/mol = 0.181 moles\n\n2. Calculate the moles of aniline needed based on the molar yield:\nMolar yield = 85% = 0.85\n\nmoles of aniline = moles of p-nitroaniline / molar yield\nmoles of aniline = 0.181 moles / 0.85 = 0.213 moles\n\n3. Calculate the moles of nitric acid needed:\nThe reaction between aniline and nitric acid is a 1:1 reaction, so the moles of nitric acid needed are equal to the moles of aniline.\n\nmoles of nitric acid = 0.213 moles\n\n4. Convert moles of nitric acid to volume in mL:\nMolar mass of nitric acid (HNO3) = 63.01 g/mol\nDensity of nitric acid (concentrated, approx. 70% w/w) = 1.42 g/mL\n\nFirst, we need to find the mass of nitric acid:\nmass of nitric acid = moles of nitric acid * molar mass of nitric acid\nmass of nitric acid = 0.213 moles * 63.01 g/mol = 13.42 g\n\nNow, we'll convert the mass of nitric acid to volume using the density:\nvolume of nitric acid = mass of nitric acid / density of nitric acid\nvolume of nitric acid = 13.42 g / 1.42 g/mL = 9.45 mL\n\nTherefore, the minimum amount of nitric acid required to prepare 25 g of p-nitroaniline from aniline with a molar yield of 85% is approximately 9.45 mL."
