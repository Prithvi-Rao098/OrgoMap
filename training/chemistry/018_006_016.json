    "message_2": "The addition of a catalyst to the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide significantly increases the rate of the reaction. A catalyst is a substance that speeds up a chemical reaction without being consumed in the process. It achieves this by lowering the activation energy required for the reaction to occur, allowing more molecules to react and form products in a shorter amount of time.\n\nIn the case of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) decomposition, the reaction can be slow at room temperature. However, when a catalyst such as manganese dioxide (MnO2), potassium iodide (KI), or catalase (an enzyme found in living organisms) is added, the rate of decomposition increases dramatically. The catalyst provides an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy, allowing the hydrogen peroxide to break down more quickly into water (H2O) and oxygen gas (O2).\n\nThe overall reaction for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide is:\n\n2H2O2 â†’ 2H2O + O2\n\nBy increasing the rate of this reaction, the catalyst helps to release oxygen gas more quickly, which can be useful in various applications, such as oxygen generation, disinfection, and waste treatment."
