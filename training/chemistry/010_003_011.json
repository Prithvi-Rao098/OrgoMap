    "message_2": "To calculate the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) for the given electrochemical reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG° = -nFE°cell\n\nwhere:\nΔG° = standard Gibbs free energy change\nn = number of moles of electrons transferred in the reaction\nF = Faraday's constant (96485 C/mol)\nE°cell = standard cell potential\n\nFirst, we need to determine the number of moles of electrons transferred in the reaction. The balanced equation is:\n\nNi(s) + 2Ag+(aq) → Ni2+(aq) + 2Ag(s)\n\nIn this reaction, 2 moles of electrons are transferred from Ni to Ag+ ions. So, n = 2.\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the equation:\n\nΔG° = -(2)(96485 C/mol)(0.86 V)\n\nΔG° = -165634.2 J/mol\n\nSince the standard Gibbs free energy change is usually expressed in kJ/mol, we can convert the value:\n\nΔG° = -165.63 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard Gibbs free energy change for the given electrochemical reaction is -165.63 kJ/mol."
