    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic moment of the complex [Fe(CN)6]4-, we first need to find the oxidation state of the central metal ion (Fe) and the number of unpaired electrons.\n\nThe complex has a -4 charge, and each CN- ligand has a -1 charge. Since there are 6 CN- ligands, the total negative charge from the ligands is -6. Therefore, the oxidation state of Fe must be +2 to balance the overall charge of the complex:\n\nFe + 6(-1) = -4\nFe = +2\n\nNow that we know the oxidation state of Fe, we can determine its electron configuration. The ground state electron configuration of Fe is [Ar] 3d^6 4s^2. In the +2 oxidation state, Fe loses two electrons, resulting in the electron configuration [Ar] 3d^6.\n\nThe complex [Fe(CN)6]4- is a low-spin complex due to the strong field ligand CN-, which causes the electrons to pair up in the lower energy d orbitals. The electron configuration of Fe(II) in a low-spin complex is:\n\nt2g^6 eg^0\n\nIn this configuration, all the d electrons are paired, and there are no unpaired electrons. Therefore, the magnetic moment of the complex [Fe(CN)6]4- is 0. The complex is diamagnetic."
