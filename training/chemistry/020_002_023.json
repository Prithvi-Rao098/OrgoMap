    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium concentrations of reactants and products, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nN₂(g) + 3H₂(g) ⇌ 2NH₃(g)\n\nNext, we need to determine the initial moles of each reactant:\n\nN₂: 1 mole\nH₂: 2 moles\nNH₃: 0 moles (since none has been formed yet)\n\nNow, let's determine the change in moles for each species during the reaction. Since the reaction has a 75% yield, we can calculate the moles of ammonia formed:\n\n0.75 × (2 moles of NH₃ formed from 1 mole of N₂) = 1.5 moles of NH₃\n\nThe change in moles for each species is as follows:\n\nN₂: -1 mole (1 mole initially - 1 mole consumed)\nH₂: -3 moles (2 moles initially - 3 moles consumed, but since we only have 2 moles, all of it will be consumed)\nNH₃: +1.5 moles (0 moles initially + 1.5 moles formed)\n\nNow, we can calculate the equilibrium moles for each species:\n\nN₂: 0 moles\nH₂: 0 moles\nNH₃: 1.5 moles\n\nTo find the equilibrium concentrations, we need to determine the total volume of the reaction mixture. Using the ideal gas law, PV = nRT, we can calculate the volume:\n\nV = nRT / P\n\nFor this problem, we'll use the total moles of gas (1 mole of N₂ + 2 moles of H₂) to find the volume:\n\nV = (3 moles) × (0.0821 L⋅atm/mol⋅K) × (773 K) / (10 atm) = 19.02 L\n\nNow, we can find the equilibrium concentrations by dividing the equilibrium moles by the volume:\n\n[N₂] = 0 moles / 19.02 L = 0 M\n[H₂] = 0 moles / 19.02 L = 0 M\n[NH₃] = 1.5 moles / 19.02 L = 0.079 M\n\nSo, the equilibrium concentrations are:\n\n[N₂] = 0 M\n[H₂] = 0 M\n[NH₃] = 0.079 M"
