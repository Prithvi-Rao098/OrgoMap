    "message_2": "The decay mode of Cobalt-60 (Co-60) is beta decay. In this process, Co-60 decays into Nickel-60 (Ni-60) by emitting beta particles (high-energy electrons) and gamma radiation.\n\nThe half-life of Co-60, which is the time it takes for half of a sample to decay into Ni-60, is approximately 5.27 years."
