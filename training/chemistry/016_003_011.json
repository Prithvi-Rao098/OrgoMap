    "message_2": "To calculate the bond dissociation energy for the O-H bond in water, we need to find the enthalpy change for the reaction H2O(g) → 2H(g) + 1/2O2(g). We can do this by using the given reactions and Hess's Law.\n\nFirst, let's write down the given reactions:\n\n1) H2O(g) → H(g) + OH(g) ; ΔH1 = +495 kJ/mol\n2) H2(g) + 1/2O2(g) → H2O(g) ; ΔH2 = -241.8 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we need to manipulate these reactions to obtain the desired reaction:\n\n3) H2O(g) → 2H(g) + 1/2O2(g)\n\nTo do this, we can reverse reaction 2 and add it to reaction 1:\n\n-1 * [H2(g) + 1/2O2(g) → H2O(g)] ; -1 * ΔH2 = +241.8 kJ/mol\nH2O(g) → H2(g) + 1/2O2(g) ; ΔH3 = +241.8 kJ/mol\n\nNow, add reaction 1 and the modified reaction 3:\n\nH2O(g) → H(g) + OH(g) ; ΔH1 = +495 kJ/mol\nH2O(g) → H2(g) + 1/2O2(g) ; ΔH3 = +241.8 kJ/mol\n----------------------------------------------\n2H2O(g) → H(g) + OH(g) + H2(g) + 1/2O2(g)\n\nNow, we can cancel out the H2(g) and 1/2O2(g) on the right side of the equation:\n\n2H2O(g) → H(g) + OH(g) + H(g)\n\nCombine the H(g) on the right side:\n\n2H2O(g) → 2H(g) + OH(g)\n\nNow, divide the entire equation by 2:\n\nH2O(g) → H(g) + 1/2OH(g)\n\nNow, we can find the enthalpy change for this reaction by adding the enthalpy changes of reaction 1 and the modified reaction 3:\n\nΔH = ΔH1 + ΔH3 = +495 kJ/mol + +241.8 kJ/mol = +736.8 kJ/mol\n\nThe bond dissociation energy for the O-H bond in water is 736.8 kJ/mol."
