    "message_2": "Hormones play a crucial role in regulating glucose levels in the body to maintain a balance known as glucose homeostasis. The primary hormones involved in this process are insulin and glucagon, which are produced by the pancreas.\n\nInsulin is a hormone secreted by the beta cells of the pancreas in response to high blood glucose levels, such as after a meal. It promotes the uptake of glucose by cells, particularly in the liver, muscles, and adipose tissue. Insulin stimulates the liver and muscle cells to store excess glucose as glycogen, and it promotes the conversion of glucose to fatty acids in adipose tissue. By doing so, insulin helps lower blood glucose levels and provides cells with the energy they need for various functions.\n\nGlucagon, on the other hand, is a hormone secreted by the alpha cells of the pancreas when blood glucose levels are low, such as during fasting or between meals. Glucagon acts primarily on the liver to stimulate the breakdown of glycogen into glucose, which is then released into the bloodstream. This process is called glycogenolysis. Glucagon also promotes gluconeogenesis, the production of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources like amino acids and glycerol. These actions of glucagon help to raise blood glucose levels and provide energy to the body.\n\nIn summary, insulin and glucagon work together to maintain glucose homeostasis in the body. Insulin lowers blood glucose levels by promoting glucose uptake and storage, while glucagon raises blood glucose levels by stimulating glycogen breakdown and gluconeogenesis. These hormones ensure that the body has a constant supply of glucose to meet its energy needs."
