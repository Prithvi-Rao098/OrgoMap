    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the formation of methane (CH4), we need to manipulate the given equations to form the desired equation: C(s) + 2H2(g) ⟶ CH4(g).\n\nFirst, reverse the first equation to get CO2(g) to C(s) + O2(g):\nCO2(g) ⟶ C(s) + O2(g); ΔH = +393.5 kJ/mol\n\nNext, divide the second equation by 2 to get 1 mol of H2O(l) on the product side:\nH2(g) + 1/2 O2(g) ⟶ H2O(l); ΔH = -571.6 kJ/mol ÷ 2 = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we need to convert H2O(l) to H2O(g) using the enthalpy of vaporization of water, which is 40.7 kJ/mol:\nH2O(l) ⟶ H2O(g); ΔH = +40.7 kJ/mol\n\nAdd the last two equations to get H2(g) + 1/2 O2(g) ⟶ H2O(g):\nH2(g) + 1/2 O2(g) ⟶ H2O(g); ΔH = -285.8 kJ/mol + 40.7 kJ/mol = -245.1 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we need two moles of H2(g) on the reactant side, so multiply the last equation by 2:\n2H2(g) + O2(g) ⟶ 2H2O(g); ΔH = -245.1 kJ/mol × 2 = -490.2 kJ/mol\n\nFinally, add the first and last equations to get the desired equation:\nCO2(g) + 2H2(g) + O2(g) ⟶ C(s) + 2H2O(g) + 2H2(g) + O2(g); ΔH = +393.5 kJ/mol - 490.2 kJ/mol\n\nC(s) + 2H2(g) ⟶ CH4(g); ΔH = -96.7 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the formation of methane (CH4) is -96.7 kJ/mol."
