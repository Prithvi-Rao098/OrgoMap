    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant for the given electrochemical cell reaction, we first need to determine the overall cell reaction and the standard cell potential (E°cell).\n\nThe overall cell reaction can be obtained by combining the two half-reactions:\n\nFe3+ + 3e- → Fe (s)      E° = -0.771 V\n3(Ag+ + e- → Ag (s))    E° = +0.799 V\n----------------------------------------------\nFe3+ + 3Ag+ → Fe (s) + 3Ag (s)\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard cell potential (E°cell) by subtracting the standard reduction potential of the anode (Fe3+ reduction) from the standard reduction potential of the cathode (Ag+ reduction):\n\nE°cell = E°cathode - E°anode\nE°cell = (+0.799 V) - (-0.771 V)\nE°cell = +1.570 V\n\nNext, we can use the Nernst equation to calculate the equilibrium constant (K) for the overall cell reaction:\n\nΔG° = -nFE°cell\n\nWhere ΔG° is the standard Gibbs free energy change, n is the number of moles of electrons transferred (in this case, n = 3), F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol), and E°cell is the standard cell potential.\n\nThe relationship between ΔG° and the equilibrium constant (K) is given by:\n\nΔG° = -RT ln K\n\nWhere R is the gas constant (8.314 J/(mol·K)) and T is the temperature in Kelvin (assuming 298 K for standard conditions).\n\nCombining the two equations, we get:\n\n-RT ln K = -nFE°cell\n\nNow, we can solve for K:\n\nln K = (nFE°cell) / (RT)\nln K = (3 * 96,485 C/mol * 1.570 V) / (8.314 J/(mol·K) * 298 K)\n\nln K ≈ 61.37\n\nTaking the exponent of both sides to get K:\n\nK ≈ e^61.37\nK ≈ 3.8 × 10^26\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium constant (K) for the given electrochemical cell reaction is approximately 3.8 × 10^26."
