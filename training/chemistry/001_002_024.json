    "message_2": "2-chlorobutane and 2-methylpropene exhibit different types of isomerism.\n\n2-chlorobutane exhibits stereoisomerism, specifically optical isomerism. Optical isomers are a type of stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, also known as enantiomers. In the case of 2-chlorobutane, the chiral center is the second carbon atom, which has four different groups attached to it: a hydrogen atom, a chlorine atom, a methyl group, and an ethyl group. Due to the presence of this chiral center, 2-chlorobutane has two enantiomers, (R)-2-chlorobutane and (S)-2-chlorobutane, which are mirror images of each other and can rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions.\n\n2-methylpropene, on the other hand, exhibits structural isomerism, specifically chain isomerism. Structural isomers have the same molecular formula but different arrangements of atoms in their structures. In the case of 2-methylpropene, its molecular formula is C4H8, and it is an isomer of butene. The difference between 2-methylpropene and its chain isomer, butene, lies in the arrangement of the carbon atoms: 2-methylpropene has a branched carbon chain with a double bond between the first and second carbon atoms and a methyl group attached to the second carbon atom, while butene has a straight carbon chain with a double bond between two of the carbon atoms.\n\nIn summary, 2-chlorobutane exhibits optical isomerism due to the presence of a chiral center, while 2-methylpropene exhibits chain isomerism due to the different arrangement of carbon atoms in its structure."
