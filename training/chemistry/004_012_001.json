    "message_2": "As an AI, I cannot physically perform experiments. However, I can guide you through the process of elemental analysis to determine the composition of an unknown compound.\n\n1. Weigh the unknown compound: Accurately weigh a small sample of the unknown compound (usually around 1 mg) and record the mass.\n\n2. Perform combustion analysis: Place the weighed sample in a combustion analyzer, which will combust the sample in the presence of excess oxygen. This process will convert all the carbon in the sample to carbon dioxide (CO2), hydrogen to water (H2O), and nitrogen to nitrogen gas (N2) or nitric oxide (NO).\n\n3. Collect the products: The combustion analyzer will separate and collect the CO2, H2O, and N2/NO produced during combustion.\n\n4. Determine the masses of the products: Measure the mass of CO2, H2O, and N2/NO collected. You can do this by weighing the absorbents before and after the combustion process and calculating the difference.\n\n5. Calculate the moles of each element: Convert the masses of CO2, H2O, and N2/NO to moles using their respective molar masses (44.01 g/mol for CO2, 18.02 g/mol for H2O, and 28.02 g/mol for N2 or 30.01 g/mol for NO).\n\n6. Calculate the moles of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen: Use the stoichiometry of the combustion reaction to determine the moles of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen in the sample. For example, one mole of CO2 contains one mole of carbon, and one mole of H2O contains two moles of hydrogen.\n\n7. Calculate the mass of each element: Convert the moles of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen back to mass using their respective molar masses (12.01 g/mol for carbon, 1.01 g/mol for hydrogen, and 14.01 g/mol for nitrogen).\n\n8. Determine the percentage composition: Divide the mass of each element by the total mass of the unknown compound and multiply by 100 to obtain the percentage composition.\n\nAfter completing these steps, you will have determined the percentage of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen in the unknown compound."
