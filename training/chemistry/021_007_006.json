    "message_2": "To calculate the formal charge of the nitrogen atom in ammonia (NH3), we can use the following formula:\n\nFormal charge = (Valence electrons of the atom) - (Non-bonding electrons) - (1/2 × Bonding electrons)\n\nFor nitrogen (N), the number of valence electrons is 5 (as it belongs to Group 15 in the periodic table).\n\nIn ammonia, nitrogen is bonded to three hydrogen atoms, and each N-H bond has 2 bonding electrons. So, there are a total of 3 × 2 = 6 bonding electrons.\n\nNitrogen has one lone pair (non-bonding electrons) in ammonia, which consists of 2 electrons.\n\nNow, we can calculate the formal charge:\n\nFormal charge of N = (5) - (2) - (1/2 × 6)\nFormal charge of N = 5 - 2 - 3\nFormal charge of N = 0\n\nSo, the formal charge of the nitrogen atom in the ammonia molecule (NH3) is 0."
