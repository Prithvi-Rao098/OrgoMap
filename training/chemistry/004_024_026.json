    "message_2": "Capillary electrophoresis (CE) is a powerful analytical technique used to separate and analyze various components in a mixture. It can be used to determine the composition of a water sample taken from a polluted river by separating and identifying the pollutants present in the sample. Here's how the process works:\n\n1. Sample preparation: First, collect a water sample from the polluted river. Filter the sample to remove any large particles or debris. Depending on the expected pollutants, you may need to perform additional sample preparation steps, such as pre-concentration or derivatization, to enhance the detection of specific analytes.\n\n2. Capillary electrophoresis setup: The CE instrument consists of a narrow capillary tube, a high-voltage power supply, and a detection system. Fill the capillary tube with an electrolyte solution, which serves as the background electrolyte (BGE). The BGE plays a crucial role in the separation process, as it determines the pH and the ionic strength of the system.\n\n3. Sample injection: Introduce a small volume of the prepared water sample into the capillary tube. This can be done using various injection techniques, such as hydrodynamic or electrokinetic injection.\n\n4. Separation: Apply a high voltage across the capillary tube, which generates an electric field. The charged analytes (pollutants) in the sample will migrate through the capillary tube under the influence of this electric field. The migration rate of each analyte depends on its charge, size, and interaction with the BGE. This results in the separation of the analytes based on their electrophoretic mobility.\n\n5. Detection: As the separated analytes pass through the detection window, they can be detected using various detection methods, such as UV-Vis absorbance, fluorescence, or mass spectrometry. The detector records a signal for each analyte, generating an electropherogram (a plot of signal intensity versus migration time).\n\n6. Data analysis: Analyze the electropherogram to identify and quantify the pollutants present in the water sample. Compare the migration times and signal intensities of the analytes with those of known standards to determine their identities and concentrations.\n\nBy using capillary electrophoresis, you can effectively determine the composition of a water sample taken from a polluted river. This technique offers high resolution, speed, and sensitivity, making it suitable for the analysis of various pollutants, such as heavy metals, organic compounds, and microorganisms."
