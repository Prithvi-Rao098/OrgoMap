    "message_1": "A student wants to determine the concentration of silver ions (Ag+) in a solution. Using an Ag/Ag+ reference electrode, the student measures the cell potential to be +0.56 V when the solution is electrolyzed for 25 minutes at a constant current of 0.50 A. The volume of the solution is 150 mL. What is the concentration of silver ions in the solution in mol/L?",
    "message_2": "To determine the concentration of silver ions in the solution, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total charge (Q) passed through the solution during electrolysis.\n2. Determine the number of moles of silver ions (n) reduced during electrolysis.\n3. Calculate the concentration of silver ions in the solution.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total charge (Q) passed through the solution during electrolysis.\nQ = current (I) × time (t)\nThe current (I) is 0.50 A, and the time (t) is 25 minutes, which is equivalent to 1500 seconds (25 × 60).\nQ = 0.50 A × 1500 s = 750 C (Coulombs)\n\nStep 2: Determine the number of moles of silver ions (n) reduced during electrolysis.\nUsing Faraday's law, we can determine the number of moles of silver ions reduced:\nn = Q / (z × F)\nwhere z is the number of electrons transferred per ion (for Ag+, z = 1) and F is Faraday's constant (96485 C/mol).\nn = 750 C / (1 × 96485 C/mol) = 0.00777 mol\n\nStep 3: Calculate the concentration of silver ions in the solution.\nThe volume of the solution is 150 mL, which is equivalent to 0.150 L. The concentration (C) of silver ions in the solution can be calculated as:\nC = n / V\nC = 0.00777 mol / 0.150 L = 0.0518 mol/L\n\nTherefore, the concentration of silver ions in the solution is approximately 0.0518 mol/L."
