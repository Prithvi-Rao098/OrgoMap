The products of the reaction are carbon dioxide gas (CO2) and water vapor (H2O). The molar entropy of CH4, CO2 and H2O at 298 K are 186.3 J/K/mol, 213.7 J/K/mol, and 188.8 J/K/mol, respectively.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the change in entropy for the combustion of methane gas, we need to consider the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nCH₄(g) + 2O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nNext, we will use the formula for the change in entropy (ΔS) of a reaction:\n\nΔS = ΣnS(products) - ΣnS(reactants)\n\nwhere n is the stoichiometric coefficient and S is the molar entropy of each species.\n\nFor the products:\n1 mol of CO₂: 1 × 213.7 J/K/mol = 213.7 J/K\n2 mol of H₂O: 2 × 188.8 J/K/mol = 377.6 J/K\n\nFor the reactants:\n1 mol of CH₄: 1 × 186.3 J/K/mol = 186.3 J/K\n2 mol of O₂: Since the problem does not provide the molar entropy of O₂, we will assume that the change in entropy of O₂ is negligible. This is a reasonable assumption because O₂ is a stable molecule and its entropy change should not significantly affect the overall entropy change of the reaction.\n\nNow, we can calculate the change in entropy (ΔS):\n\nΔS = (213.7 + 377.6) - (186.3) = 591.3 - 186.3 = 405 J/K\n\nThe change in entropy for the combustion of methane gas at constant pressure and temperature of 298 K is 405 J/K."
