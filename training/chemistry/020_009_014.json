    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction, we first need to determine the change in concentration for both NO2 and N2O4 at equilibrium.\n\nInitial concentrations:\n[NO2] = 0.25 M\n[N2O4] = 0.10 M\n\nAt equilibrium:\n[NO2] = 0.14 M\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is 2NO2 ⇌ N2O4, for every mole of N2O4 formed, 2 moles of NO2 are consumed. Let's denote the change in concentration of NO2 as x. Then, the change in concentration of N2O4 will be x/2.\n\n0.25 M - x = 0.14 M (for NO2)\n0.10 M + x/2 = equilibrium concentration of N2O4\n\nNow we can solve for x:\nx = 0.25 M - 0.14 M = 0.11 M\n\nNow we can find the equilibrium concentration of N2O4:\n0.10 M + (0.11 M)/2 = 0.10 M + 0.055 M = 0.155 M\n\nNow we can calculate the equilibrium constant (Kc) using the equilibrium concentrations:\n\nKc = [N2O4] / [NO2]^2\nKc = (0.155 M) / (0.14 M)^2\nKc ≈ 7.97\n\nThe equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction 2NO2(g) ⇌ N2O4(g) is approximately 7.97."
