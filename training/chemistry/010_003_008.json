    "message_1": "What is the Gibbs free energy change at standard conditions (25°C, 1 atm) for the following electrochemical reaction?\n\nZn(s) + Cu2+(aq) → Zn2+(aq) + Cu(s) \n\nGiven that the standard reduction potential for Cu2+ + 2e- → Cu(s) is +0.34 V and for Zn2+ + 2e- → Zn(s) is -0.76 V.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the electrochemical reaction, we first need to determine the cell potential (E°) for the reaction. The cell potential can be found by subtracting the standard reduction potential of the anode (Zn) from the standard reduction potential of the cathode (Cu):\n\nE° = E°(cathode) - E°(anode)\n\nE° = (+0.34 V) - (-0.76 V) = +1.10 V\n\nNow that we have the cell potential, we can calculate the Gibbs free energy change using the formula:\n\nΔG = -nFE°\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the reaction (in this case, 2 moles of electrons), F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol), and E° is the cell potential.\n\nΔG = -(2 mol)(96,485 C/mol)(1.10 V)\n\nΔG = -212,267 J/mol\n\nThe Gibbs free energy change for the reaction at standard conditions (25°C, 1 atm) is -212,267 J/mol."
