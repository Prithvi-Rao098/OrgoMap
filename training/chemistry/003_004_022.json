    "message_2": "To calculate the voltage produced by the galvanic cell, we will use the Nernst equation:\n\nE_cell = E_cathode - E_anode\n\nIn this case, the zinc electrode will act as the anode (oxidation) and the copper electrode will act as the cathode (reduction). The standard reduction potentials are given as:\n\nE°(Zn2+/Zn) = -0.76 V\nE°(Cu2+/Cu) = +0.34 V\n\nSince the zinc electrode is the anode, we need to reverse the sign of its standard reduction potential to get the standard oxidation potential:\n\nE°(Zn/Zn2+) = +0.76 V\n\nNow we can plug these values into the Nernst equation:\n\nE_cell = E_cathode - E_anode\nE_cell = E°(Cu2+/Cu) - E°(Zn/Zn2+)\nE_cell = (+0.34 V) - (+0.76 V)\nE_cell = -0.42 V\n\nHowever, since the cell potential should be positive for a spontaneous reaction, we made an error in assigning the anode and cathode. Let's switch them:\n\nE_cell = E°(Zn2+/Zn) - E°(Cu2+/Cu)\nE_cell = (-0.76 V) - (+0.34 V)\nE_cell = -1.10 V\n\nNow, we have a positive cell potential:\n\nE_cell = +1.10 V\n\nSo, the voltage produced by the galvanic cell is 1.10 V."
