    "message_2": "To calculate the theoretical yield of p-nitroaniline, we need to use stoichiometry. First, we need the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nAniline (C6H5NH2) + HNO3 → p-Nitroaniline (C6H5N2O2) + H2O\n\nNow, we need the molar masses of aniline and p-nitroaniline:\n\nAniline: C6H5NH2 = (6 × 12.01) + (5 × 1.01) + 14.01 = 93.13 g/mol\np-Nitroaniline: C6H5N2O2 = (6 × 12.01) + (5 × 1.01) + (2 × 14.01) + (2 × 16.00) = 138.12 g/mol\n\nNext, we need to convert the given mass of aniline (5 grams) to moles:\n\nmoles of aniline = mass / molar mass = 5 g / 93.13 g/mol = 0.0537 mol\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, the moles of p-nitroaniline produced will be equal to the moles of aniline used:\n\nmoles of p-nitroaniline = 0.0537 mol\n\nNow, we can convert the moles of p-nitroaniline to grams:\n\nmass of p-nitroaniline = moles × molar mass = 0.0537 mol × 138.12 g/mol = 7.42 g\n\nSo, the theoretical yield of p-nitroaniline is 7.42 grams, assuming complete conversion and 100% yield."
