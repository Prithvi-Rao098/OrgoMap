    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the transition of water from ice at -10°C to liquid water at 25°C, we need to consider three steps:\n\n1. Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C\n2. Melting the ice at 0°C\n3. Heating the liquid water from 0°C to 25°C\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the phase transition is:\nH2O(s) -> H2O(l)\n\nStep 1: Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C\nq1 = mcΔT\nwhere q1 is the heat required, m is the mass of water, c is the specific heat capacity of ice (2.09 J/g·°C), and ΔT is the change in temperature (10°C).\nq1 = m × 2.09 J/g·°C × 10°C\n\nStep 2: Melting the ice at 0°C\nq2 = mΔHfus\nwhere q2 is the heat required and ΔHfus is the enthalpy of fusion for water (6.01 kJ/mol or 6.01 J/g).\nq2 = m × 6.01 J/g\n\nStep 3: Heating the liquid water from 0°C to 25°C\nq3 = mcΔT\nwhere q3 is the heat required, c is the specific heat capacity of liquid water (4.18 J/g·°C), and ΔT is the change in temperature (25°C).\nq3 = m × 4.18 J/g·°C × 25°C\n\nThe total enthalpy change (q_total) is the sum of the enthalpy changes for each step:\nq_total = q1 + q2 + q3\nq_total = m × (2.09 J/g·°C × 10°C) + m × (6.01 J/g) + m × (4.18 J/g·°C × 25°C)\n\nSince we are looking for the standard enthalpy change, we can divide q_total by the mass (m) to get the enthalpy change per gram:\nΔH = (2.09 J/g·°C × 10°C) + (6.01 J/g) + (4.18 J/g·°C × 25°C)\nΔH = 20.9 J/g + 6.01 J/g + 104.5 J/g\nΔH = 131.41 J/g\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change for the transition of water from ice at -10°C to liquid water at 25°C is 131.41 J/g."
