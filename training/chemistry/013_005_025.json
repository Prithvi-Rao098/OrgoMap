    "message_2": "To determine the surface area of the solid powder sample of activated carbon, we can use the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory. However, since we are assuming a monomolecular layer of nitrogen on the surface, we can use the simpler Langmuir adsorption model.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of nitrogen molecules adsorbed on the surface. We know that 1 mole of any substance contains Avogadro's number (N_A) of particles:\n\nN_A = 6.022 x 10^23 particles/mol\n\nSo, the number of nitrogen molecules adsorbed is:\n\nN_adsorbed = 2.5 moles * N_A = 2.5 * 6.022 x 10^23 = 1.5055 x 10^24 molecules\n\nNext, we need to find the area occupied by one nitrogen molecule on the surface. We can use the cross-sectional area of nitrogen at the temperature of 77 K and a pressure of 1 atm. The cross-sectional area of nitrogen (A_N2) is approximately 0.162 nm^2.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total surface area (A_total) of the activated carbon sample:\n\nA_total = N_adsorbed * A_N2\nA_total = 1.5055 x 10^24 molecules * 0.162 nm^2/molecule\n\nA_total ≈ 2.439 x 10^24 nm^2\n\nTo convert the surface area to a more common unit, such as m^2, we can use the conversion factor:\n\n1 m^2 = 10^18 nm^2\n\nA_total ≈ 2.439 x 10^24 nm^2 * (1 m^2 / 10^18 nm^2)\nA_total ≈ 2.439 x 10^6 m^2\n\nSo, the surface area of the solid powder sample of activated carbon is approximately 2.439 x 10^6 m^2."
