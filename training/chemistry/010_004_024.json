    "message_2": "To determine the cell potential for the electrochemical reaction, we first need to balance the half-reactions and then combine them to form the overall redox reaction.\n\nThe given half-reactions are:\n1. Cu2+(aq) + 2e- --> Cu(s) with an electrode potential of +0.34V\n2. Fe3+(aq) + e- --> Fe2+(aq) with an electrode potential of +0.77V\n\nTo balance the number of electrons in both half-reactions, we need to multiply the second half-reaction by 2:\n\n2(Fe3+(aq) + e- --> Fe2+(aq)) becomes 2Fe3+(aq) + 2e- --> 2Fe2+(aq) with an electrode potential of +0.77V\n\nNow, we can combine the two half-reactions:\n\nCu2+(aq) + 2e- + 2Fe3+(aq) + 2e- --> Cu(s) + 2Fe2+(aq)\n\nThe overall redox reaction is:\n\nCu2+(aq) + 2Fe3+(aq) --> Cu(s) + 2Fe2+(aq)\n\nTo find the cell potential, we subtract the electrode potential of the half-reaction with the lower potential from the one with the higher potential:\n\nE_cell = E_higher - E_lower\nE_cell = 0.77V - 0.34V\nE_cell = 0.43V\n\nSo, the cell potential for the electrochemical reaction when Cu2+(aq) and Fe3+(aq) ions react to form Cu(s) and Fe2+(aq) ions is 0.43V."
