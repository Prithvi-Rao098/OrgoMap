The heat of solution of sodium acetate trihydrate is -4245 J/g.  ",
    "message_2": "To find the heat of crystallization of sodium acetate trihydrate, we first need to calculate the heat released when it is dissolved in water and then the heat absorbed when the solution is cooled.\n\n1. Heat released during dissolution:\nHeat of solution = -4245 J/g\nMass of sodium acetate trihydrate = 50 g\n\nHeat released = Heat of solution × Mass\nHeat released = -4245 J/g × 50 g = -212250 J\n\nSince the heat released is negative, it means that the dissolution process is exothermic and releases heat to the surroundings.\n\n2. Heat absorbed during cooling:\nWe will use the formula q = mcΔT, where q is the heat absorbed, m is the mass of the solution, c is the specific heat capacity of water (4.18 J/g°C), and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nFirst, we need to find the mass of the solution. Assuming the density of the solution is approximately the same as water (1 g/mL), the mass of the water is 200 g. Adding the mass of sodium acetate trihydrate (50 g), the total mass of the solution is 250 g.\n\nΔT = Final temperature - Initial temperature = 10°C - 25°C = -15°C\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat absorbed:\nq = mcΔT\nq = (250 g)(4.18 J/g°C)(-15°C) = -15675 J\n\nSince the heat absorbed is negative, it means that the cooling process is endothermic and absorbs heat from the surroundings.\n\n3. Heat of crystallization:\nThe heat of crystallization is the difference between the heat released during dissolution and the heat absorbed during cooling.\n\nHeat of crystallization = Heat released - Heat absorbed\nHeat of crystallization = -212250 J - (-15675 J) = -196575 J\n\nThe heat of crystallization of 50 g of sodium acetate trihydrate is -196575 J."
