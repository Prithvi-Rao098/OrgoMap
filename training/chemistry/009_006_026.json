    "message_2": "The isotope notation for an atom with 16 protons, 16 neutrons, and 18 electrons is:\n\nS²⁻³²\n\nHere's the breakdown of the notation:\n\n- S: The chemical symbol for the element with 16 protons, which is sulfur.\n- ²⁻: The superscript to the left indicates the charge of the ion. Since there are 18 electrons (2 more than the number of protons), the ion has a 2- charge.\n- ³²: The superscript to the right represents the mass number (the sum of protons and neutrons). In this case, 16 protons + 16 neutrons = 32."
