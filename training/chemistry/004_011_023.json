    "message_2": "To identify the structure of the unknown compound using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, follow these steps:\n\n1. Obtain the NMR spectra: First, obtain both the proton (1H) and carbon (13C) NMR spectra of the unknown compound. These spectra will provide information about the number and types of hydrogen and carbon atoms in the compound, as well as their chemical environments.\n\n2. Analyze the 13C NMR spectrum: Count the number of peaks in the 13C NMR spectrum to determine the number of unique carbon environments in the compound. Each peak corresponds to a different type of carbon atom. Note the chemical shifts of each peak, as these can provide clues to the types of functional groups present in the compound.\n\n3. Analyze the 1H NMR spectrum: Count the number of peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum to determine the number of unique hydrogen environments in the compound. Each peak corresponds to a different type of hydrogen atom. Note the chemical shifts, integration values, and splitting patterns of each peak, as these can provide information about the chemical environment of the hydrogen atoms and their connectivity to other atoms in the compound.\n\n4. Determine the molecular formula: Use the information obtained from the NMR spectra to determine the molecular formula of the compound. This can be done by considering the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms, as well as any other elements that may be present in the compound (e.g., oxygen, nitrogen, halogens).\n\n5. Identify functional groups: Based on the chemical shifts and other information obtained from the NMR spectra, identify the functional groups present in the compound. Common functional groups include alcohols, amines, carbonyls, and aromatic rings.\n\n6. Determine the connectivity of atoms: Use the splitting patterns and coupling constants in the 1H NMR spectrum to determine the connectivity of the hydrogen atoms to other atoms in the compound. This information, along with the information obtained from the 13C NMR spectrum, can be used to piece together the overall structure of the compound.\n\n7. Confirm the structure: Once a proposed structure has been determined, compare the predicted NMR spectra of the proposed structure to the actual NMR spectra of the unknown compound. If the predicted and actual spectra match, the structure of the compound has been successfully identified.\n\nIn summary, by analyzing the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of an unknown compound, it is possible to determine its molecular formula, identify the functional groups present, and piece together its overall structure."
