The combustion of 0.50 g of methane in a bomb calorimeter resulted in a 1.20°C temperature increase of the surrounding water. The heat capacity of the bomb calorimeter is 5.85 kJ/°C.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the heat released during the combustion of 0.50 g of methane using the heat capacity of the bomb calorimeter and the temperature increase:\n\nq = C * ΔT\nq = 5.85 kJ/°C * 1.20°C\nq = 7.02 kJ\n\nNow, let's convert the mass of methane to moles using its molar mass (12.01 g/mol for carbon and 1.01 g/mol for hydrogen):\n\n0.50 g CH4 * (1 mol CH4 / (12.01 g/mol C + 4 * 1.01 g/mol H)) = 0.0312 mol CH4\n\nNext, we'll find the heat released per mole of methane:\n\nq/mol = 7.02 kJ / 0.0312 mol = 225 kJ/mol\n\nThe balanced combustion reaction of methane is:\n\nCH4 + 2 O2 -> CO2 + 2 H2O\n\nUsing the standard enthalpy of formation values for CO2 and H2O, we can write the equation for the standard enthalpy change of the reaction:\n\nΔH°_rxn = ΔH°_f[CO2] + 2 * ΔH°_f[H2O] - ΔH°_f[CH4]\n\nWe know the standard enthalpy change of the reaction is -225 kJ/mol (since the heat released is positive, the enthalpy change is negative), and we have the values for CO2 and H2O:\n\n-225 kJ/mol = (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 * (-285.8 kJ/mol) - ΔH°_f[CH4]\n\nNow, we can solve for the standard enthalpy of formation of methane:\n\nΔH°_f[CH4] = -393.5 kJ/mol + 2 * 285.8 kJ/mol + 225 kJ/mol\nΔH°_f[CH4] = -74.9 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy of formation of methane (CH4) is approximately -74.9 kJ/mol."
