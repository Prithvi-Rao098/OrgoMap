    "message_2": "To find the pH of the resulting solution, we first need to determine the amount of HCl and NaOH in moles and then find the moles of the remaining acid or base after the reaction.\n\n1. Calculate the moles of HCl and NaOH:\nmoles of HCl = volume (L) × concentration (M)\nmoles of HCl = 0.050 L × 0.1 M = 0.005 moles\n\nmoles of NaOH = volume (L) × concentration (M)\nmoles of NaOH = 0.100 L × 0.05 M = 0.005 moles\n\n2. Determine the moles of remaining acid or base after the reaction:\nHCl and NaOH react in a 1:1 ratio, so they will neutralize each other completely, and there will be no remaining HCl or NaOH.\n\nHCl + NaOH → NaCl + H2O\n\n0.005 moles HCl + 0.005 moles NaOH → 0.005 moles NaCl + 0.005 moles H2O\n\n3. Calculate the pH of the resulting solution:\nSince there is no remaining acid or base, the resulting solution is neutral, and the pH is 7."
