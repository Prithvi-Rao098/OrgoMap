    "message_2": "To calculate the bond order and bond length of the CO molecule using molecular orbital theory, we first need to determine the electronic configuration of the molecule. CO has a total of 14 electrons (6 from carbon and 8 from oxygen).\n\nThe molecular orbitals for CO can be represented as follows (in increasing energy order):\n\n1. σ(1s)\n2. σ*(1s)\n3. σ(2s)\n4. σ*(2s)\n5. σ(2pz)\n6. π(2px) = π(2py)\n7. π*(2px) = π*(2py)\n8. σ*(2pz)\n\nNow, let's fill the molecular orbitals with the 14 electrons:\n\n1. σ(1s) - 2 electrons\n2. σ*(1s) - 2 electrons\n3. σ(2s) - 2 electrons\n4. σ*(2s) - 2 electrons\n5. σ(2pz) - 2 electrons\n6. π(2px) = π(2py) - 4 electrons (2 in each orbital)\n7. π*(2px) = π*(2py) - 0 electrons\n8. σ*(2pz) - 0 electrons\n\nThe bond order can be calculated using the formula:\n\nBond order = (number of electrons in bonding orbitals - number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\n\nBond order = (2 + 2 + 2 + 4 - 2 - 2) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3\n\nThe bond order of CO is 3, which indicates a triple bond between the carbon and oxygen atoms.\n\nTo determine the bond length, we can refer to experimental data. The bond length of CO is approximately 1.128 Å (angstroms). It's important to note that molecular orbital theory doesn't provide a direct method for calculating bond lengths, so we rely on experimental data for this value."
