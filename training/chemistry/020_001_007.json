    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction, we can use the expression:\n\nKc = ([NO]^2 * [Cl2]) / ([NOCl]^2)\n\nAt equilibrium, the concentrations are given as [NOCl] = 0.050 M, [NO] = 0.030 M, and [Cl2] = 0.020 M. Plug these values into the Kc expression:\n\nKc = (0.030^2 * 0.020) / (0.050^2)\n\nKc = (0.0009 * 0.020) / (0.0025)\n\nKc = 0.018 / 0.0025\n\nKc ≈ 7.2\n\nThe equilibrium constant for the reaction is approximately 7.2."
