    "message_1": "What is the reaction quotient, Qc, for the reaction below when initial concentrations of the reactants and products are [SO2] = 0.50 M, [O2] = 0.30 M, [SO3] = 0.20 M at 25°C?\n\n2SO2 (g) + O2 (g) ⇌ 2SO3 (g) \n\nNote: The equilibrium constant (Kc) for this reaction at 25°C is 2.5 x 10^2.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the reaction quotient (Qc) for the given reaction, we use the following expression:\n\nQc = [SO3]^2 / ([SO2]^2 * [O2])\n\nUsing the given initial concentrations:\n\nQc = ([0.20]^2) / ([0.50]^2 * [0.30])\n\nQc = (0.04) / (0.25 * 0.30)\n\nQc = 0.04 / 0.075\n\nQc ≈ 0.533\n\nSo, the reaction quotient (Qc) for the given reaction with the initial concentrations is approximately 0.533."
