    "message_2": "To determine the amount of chlorine needed, we first need to find the molecular weights of benzoic acid and 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid. Then, we will calculate the theoretical yield and finally the amount of chlorine required.\n\n1. Molecular weight of benzoic acid (C7H6O2): \nC: 12.01 g/mol * 7 = 84.07 g/mol\nH: 1.01 g/mol * 6 = 6.06 g/mol\nO: 16.00 g/mol * 2 = 32.00 g/mol\nTotal molecular weight = 84.07 + 6.06 + 32.00 = 122.13 g/mol\n\n2. Molecular weight of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid (C7H4Cl2O2):\nC: 12.01 g/mol * 7 = 84.07 g/mol\nH: 1.01 g/mol * 4 = 4.04 g/mol\nCl: 35.45 g/mol * 2 = 70.90 g/mol\nO: 16.00 g/mol * 2 = 32.00 g/mol\nTotal molecular weight = 84.07 + 4.04 + 70.90 + 32.00 = 191.01 g/mol\n\n3. Calculate the theoretical yield:\nSince the actual yield is 90%, we need to find the theoretical yield first.\nActual yield = 30 g (given)\nPercentage yield = 90% (given)\nTheoretical yield = Actual yield / Percentage yield\nTheoretical yield = 30 g / 0.90 = 33.33 g\n\n4. Calculate the moles of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid:\nMoles = mass / molecular weight\nMoles of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid = 33.33 g / 191.01 g/mol = 0.1744 mol\n\n5. Calculate the moles of benzoic acid:\nSince the reaction is 1:1, the moles of benzoic acid are the same as the moles of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid.\nMoles of benzoic acid = 0.1744 mol\n\n6. Calculate the mass of benzoic acid:\nMass = moles * molecular weight\nMass of benzoic acid = 0.1744 mol * 122.13 g/mol = 21.31 g\n\n7. Calculate the mass of chlorine:\nMass of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid (theoretical yield) = 33.33 g\nMass of benzoic acid = 21.31 g\nMass of chlorine = Mass of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid - Mass of benzoic acid\nMass of chlorine = 33.33 g - 21.31 g = 12.02 g\n\nTherefore, 12.02 grams of chlorine are required to prepare 30 grams of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid from benzoic acid, assuming a yield of 90% and excess benzoic acid."
