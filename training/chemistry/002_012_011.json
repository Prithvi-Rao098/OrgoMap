    "message_2": "To calculate the bond order and bond length of the carbon-nitrogen triple bond in cyanide ion (CN^-) using valence bond theory and molecular orbital theory, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the electronic configuration of the atoms involved.\n2. Construct the molecular orbitals using linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO).\n3. Calculate the bond order.\n4. Determine the bond length using experimental data or theoretical calculations.\n\nStep 1: Electronic configuration\nCarbon (C) has 6 electrons: 1s² 2s² 2p²\nNitrogen (N) has 7 electrons: 1s² 2s² 2p³\nCyanide ion (CN^-) has an extra electron, so there are a total of 14 electrons.\n\nStep 2: Construct molecular orbitals\nFor CN^-, we will consider only the valence electrons (2s and 2p orbitals) in the LCAO. The molecular orbitals formed are:\n- σ(2s) and σ*(2s) from the linear combination of 2s orbitals of C and N\n- σ(2pz), π(2px), π(2py), σ*(2pz), π*(2px), and π*(2py) from the linear combination of 2p orbitals of C and N\n\nStep 3: Calculate bond order\nNow, we fill the molecular orbitals with the 10 valence electrons (5 from C and 5 from N, plus the extra electron in CN^-). The filling order is:\nσ(2s)² < σ*(2s)² < σ(2pz)² < π(2px)² = π(2py)² < σ*(2pz) < π*(2px) = π*(2py)\n\nThe bond order can be calculated as:\nBond order = (number of electrons in bonding orbitals - number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\nBond order = (8 - 2) / 2 = 3\n\nSo, the bond order of CN^- is 3, indicating a triple bond between carbon and nitrogen.\n\nStep 4: Determine bond length\nThe bond length of CN^- can be determined using experimental data or theoretical calculations. According to experimental data, the bond length of CN^- is approximately 1.16 Å (angstroms).\n\nIn summary, the bond order of the carbon-nitrogen triple bond in cyanide ion (CN^-) is 3, and the bond length is approximately 1.16 Å."
