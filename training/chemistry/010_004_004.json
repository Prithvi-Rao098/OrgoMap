    "message_1": "What is the cell potential when 1.50 grams of Al is oxidized at the anode and 1.50 grams of Ag ions are reduced at the cathode, in a standard electrochemical cell at 25°C? The half-cell equations for the reactions are:\n\nAl³⁺(aq) + 3e⁻ → Al(s) E° = -1.66 V\n\nAg⁺(aq) + e⁻ → Ag(s) E° = +0.80 V",
    "message_2": "To find the cell potential, we first need to determine the overall redox reaction and then calculate the cell potential using the standard reduction potentials (E°) given for each half-cell reaction.\n\nFirst, we balance the number of electrons transferred in each half-cell reaction:\n\nAl³⁺(aq) + 3e⁻ → Al(s) (oxidation half-reaction)\n3(Ag⁺(aq) + e⁻ → Ag(s)) (reduction half-reaction)\n\nNow, we add the two half-cell reactions to get the overall redox reaction:\n\nAl³⁺(aq) + 3Ag⁺(aq) + 3e⁻ → Al(s) + 3Ag(s) + 3e⁻\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nAl³⁺(aq) + 3Ag⁺(aq) → Al(s) + 3Ag(s)\n\nNow, we can calculate the cell potential (E_cell) using the standard reduction potentials (E°) given for each half-cell reaction:\n\nE_cell = E°(cathode) - E°(anode)\n\nIn this case, the cathode is the reduction half-cell (Ag⁺/Ag) and the anode is the oxidation half-cell (Al³⁺/Al):\n\nE_cell = (+0.80 V) - (-1.66 V) = +0.80 V + 1.66 V = 2.46 V\n\nSo, the cell potential for this electrochemical cell is 2.46 V at 25°C."
