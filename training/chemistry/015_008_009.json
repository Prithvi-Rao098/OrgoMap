    "message_2": "The molecular structure of a compound plays a crucial role in determining its reactivity and selectivity in chemical reactions. Several factors related to the molecular structure influence these properties, including:\n\n1. Electronic structure: The distribution of electrons within a molecule, particularly the presence of lone pairs, multiple bonds, and the overall electron density, can greatly affect its reactivity. Molecules with high electron density are more likely to participate in reactions as nucleophiles (electron donors), while those with low electron density are more likely to act as electrophiles (electron acceptors). The electronic structure also influences the stability of intermediates formed during a reaction, which can affect the reaction rate and selectivity.\n\n2. Steric factors: The size and shape of a molecule, as well as the presence of bulky substituents, can influence its reactivity and selectivity. Steric hindrance can prevent certain reactions from occurring or favor specific pathways due to the limited accessibility of reactive sites. For example, bulky groups can block the approach of a reactant to a specific part of the molecule, leading to selective reactions at other, more accessible sites.\n\n3. Bond strength and polarity: The strength and polarity of the bonds within a molecule can also affect its reactivity. Molecules with weaker bonds are generally more reactive, as these bonds can be more easily broken during a reaction. Additionally, polar bonds can lead to the formation of partial positive and negative charges within a molecule, making it more susceptible to nucleophilic or electrophilic attack.\n\n4. Aromaticity and conjugation: Aromatic and conjugated systems, which involve the delocalization of electrons across multiple atoms or bonds, can influence the reactivity and selectivity of a compound. Aromatic compounds are generally less reactive than their non-aromatic counterparts due to the stability provided by the delocalized electrons. However, certain reactions, such as electrophilic aromatic substitution, can still occur selectively at specific positions within the aromatic ring.\n\n5. Functional groups: The presence of specific functional groups within a molecule can greatly affect its reactivity and selectivity. Functional groups, such as hydroxyl, carbonyl, or amine groups, can act as reactive sites or influence the reactivity of nearby atoms. Additionally, functional groups can participate in specific types of reactions, such as acid-base, redox, or substitution reactions, which can determine the overall reactivity and selectivity of a compound.\n\nIn summary, the molecular structure of a compound, including its electronic structure, steric factors, bond properties, aromaticity, and functional groups, plays a significant role in determining its reactivity and selectivity in chemical reactions. Understanding these factors is essential for predicting reaction outcomes and designing efficient synthetic pathways in chemistry."
