    "message_1": "Suppose you have a chemical equilibrium system where nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4) are in equilibrium as follows: \n\n2NO2(g)  <--> N2O4(g)\n\nIf you remove some of the NO2 gas from the system, what will be the effect on the equilibrium position of the system? Will the reaction shift to the left or to the right? Explain your answer, addressing changes in concentration, pressure or temperature.",
    "message_2": "If you remove some of the NO2 gas from the system, the equilibrium position will be affected according to Le Chatelier's principle. Le Chatelier's principle states that if a change is applied to a system at equilibrium, the system will adjust itself to counteract the change and restore a new equilibrium.\n\nIn this case, when you remove some of the NO2 gas, the concentration of NO2 decreases. To counteract this change and restore equilibrium, the reaction will shift to the left, favoring the formation of more NO2 from N2O4. This is because the decrease in NO2 concentration will cause an increase in the reaction rate of the reverse reaction (N2O4 to 2NO2) compared to the forward reaction (2NO2 to N2O4). As a result, more N2O4 will be converted back to NO2 until a new equilibrium is established.\n\nThis shift in equilibrium does not involve changes in pressure or temperature, as only the concentration of NO2 is affected in this scenario. However, it is important to note that changes in pressure or temperature could also affect the equilibrium position in different ways, but they are not relevant in this specific case."
