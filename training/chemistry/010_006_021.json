    "message_1": "What is the concentration, in mol dm⁻³, of nickel ions in a solution that was analyzed using the electrochemical technique of coulometry, with a current of 0.5 A applied for 1.5 hours and metal deposit of 0.35 g on the cathode? If the oxidation state of the nickel ion in the solution is +2, what is the mass percentage of nickel in the solution? (Assume a Faraday's constant of 96,500 C mol⁻¹ and a molar mass of nickel of 58.69 g mol⁻¹).",
    "message_2": "First, we need to calculate the total charge (Q) passed through the solution during the coulometry experiment. We can do this using the formula:\n\nQ = I × t\n\nwhere I is the current (0.5 A) and t is the time (1.5 hours).\n\nSince the time is given in hours, we need to convert it to seconds:\n\n1.5 hours × (3600 seconds/hour) = 5400 seconds\n\nNow, we can calculate the total charge:\n\nQ = 0.5 A × 5400 s = 2700 C\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of moles of electrons (n) transferred during the experiment. We can do this using Faraday's constant (F):\n\nn = Q / F\n\nn = 2700 C / 96,500 C mol⁻¹ ≈ 0.02797 mol\n\nSince the oxidation state of the nickel ion is +2, the number of moles of nickel ions (Ni²⁺) in the solution is half the number of moles of electrons:\n\nmoles of Ni²⁺ = 0.02797 mol / 2 = 0.013985 mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the concentration of nickel ions in the solution. We know that the mass of the nickel deposit on the cathode is 0.35 g, and the molar mass of nickel is 58.69 g mol⁻¹. We can use these values to find the volume of the solution:\n\n0.35 g / (0.013985 mol × 58.69 g mol⁻¹) = V\n\nV ≈ 0.001 dm³\n\nNow, we can calculate the concentration of nickel ions in the solution:\n\nconcentration of Ni²⁺ = 0.013985 mol / 0.001 dm³ = 13.985 mol dm⁻³\n\nTo find the mass percentage of nickel in the solution, we can use the following formula:\n\nmass percentage = (mass of nickel / total mass of solution) × 100\n\nWe know the mass of nickel is 0.35 g, but we need to find the total mass of the solution. Since the volume of the solution is 0.001 dm³, we can assume the density of the solution is approximately 1 g cm⁻³ (or 1 g mL⁻¹), which is close to the density of water. Therefore, the total mass of the solution is:\n\n0.001 dm³ × (1000 mL/dm³) × (1 g/mL) = 1 g\n\nNow, we can calculate the mass percentage of nickel in the solution:\n\nmass percentage = (0.35 g / 1 g) × 100 = 35%\n\nSo, the concentration of nickel ions in the solution is 13.985 mol dm⁻³, and the mass percentage of nickel in the solution is 35%."
