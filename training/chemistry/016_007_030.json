Use the heat of combustion values for glucose and its constituent elements (C, H, and O) to calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction. Include the balanced chemical equation for the reaction, and express the answer in kilojoules per mole (kJ/mol).",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy of formation of glucose (C6H12O6), we can use the heat of combustion values for glucose and its constituent elements (C, H, and O). The balanced chemical equation for the combustion of glucose is:\n\nC6H12O6 (s) + 6O2 (g) → 6CO2 (g) + 6H2O (l)\n\nThe standard heat of combustion values for the substances involved in the reaction are:\n\nΔHc° (C6H12O6) = -2803 kJ/mol\nΔHc° (C) = -393.5 kJ/mol (for CO2)\nΔHc° (H2) = -285.8 kJ/mol (for H2O)\n\nNow, we can use Hess's Law to calculate the standard enthalpy of formation of glucose. According to Hess's Law, the enthalpy change for the formation of glucose can be calculated as:\n\nΔHf° (C6H12O6) = Σ ΔHc° (products) - Σ ΔHc° (reactants)\n\nΔHf° (C6H12O6) = [6 × (-393.5) + 6 × (-285.8)] - (-2803)\n\nΔHf° (C6H12O6) = [-2361 - 1714.8] - (-2803)\n\nΔHf° (C6H12O6) = -4075.8 + 2803\n\nΔHf° (C6H12O6) = -1272.8 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy of formation of glucose (C6H12O6) is -1272.8 kJ/mol."
