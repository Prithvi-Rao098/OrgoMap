    "message_1": "What mass of lead(II) chloride (PbCl2) will precipitate out of a solution containing 50.0 mL of 0.200 M lead(II) nitrate (Pb(NO3)2) when it is mixed with 100.0 mL of 0.150 M sodium chloride (NaCl)?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we'll first determine the limiting reactant, and then use stoichiometry to find the mass of lead(II) chloride (PbCl2) that will precipitate.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nPb(NO3)2 (aq) + 2 NaCl (aq) → PbCl2 (s) + 2 NaNO3 (aq)\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of each reactant:\n\nMoles of Pb(NO3)2 = (Volume × Molarity) = (50.0 mL × 0.200 mol/L) = 0.0100 mol\nMoles of NaCl = (Volume × Molarity) = (100.0 mL × 0.150 mol/L) = 0.0150 mol\n\nNow, we'll determine the limiting reactant by comparing the mole ratio of the reactants:\n\nMole ratio of Pb(NO3)2 to NaCl = (0.0100 mol Pb(NO3)2) / (0.0150 mol NaCl) = 0.6667\n\nSince the balanced equation requires 1 mole of Pb(NO3)2 for every 2 moles of NaCl, and the mole ratio of Pb(NO3)2 to NaCl is less than 1:2, Pb(NO3)2 is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow, we'll use stoichiometry to find the moles of PbCl2 that will precipitate:\n\nMoles of PbCl2 = (Moles of Pb(NO3)2) × (1 mol PbCl2 / 1 mol Pb(NO3)2) = 0.0100 mol PbCl2\n\nFinally, we'll convert the moles of PbCl2 to mass using the molar mass of PbCl2 (Pb = 207.2 g/mol, Cl = 35.45 g/mol):\n\nMass of PbCl2 = (0.0100 mol PbCl2) × (207.2 g/mol Pb + 2 × 35.45 g/mol Cl) = 0.0100 mol × 277.1 g/mol = 2.77 g\n\nSo, 2.77 grams of lead(II) chloride (PbCl2) will precipitate out of the solution."
