    "message_1": "How much chlorine gas (in grams) is needed to produce 50 grams of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid from benzoic acid if the reaction yield is 80% and the molar mass of chlorine gas is 70.9 g/mol?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction.\n2. Calculate the moles of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid produced.\n3. Calculate the moles of chlorine gas needed based on the stoichiometry of the reaction.\n4. Calculate the grams of chlorine gas needed based on the molar mass of chlorine gas.\n5. Adjust the amount of chlorine gas needed based on the reaction yield.\n\nStep 1: Balanced chemical equation\nC6H5COOH + 2 Cl2 → C6H3Cl2COOH + 2 HCl\n\nBenzoic acid + Chlorine gas → 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid + Hydrochloric acid\n\nStep 2: Calculate the moles of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid produced\nMolar mass of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid = 12(6) + 1(3) + 16(2) + 35.5(2) = 72 + 3 + 32 + 71 = 178 g/mol\n\n50 g of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid * (1 mol / 178 g) = 0.2809 mol of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid\n\nStep 3: Calculate the moles of chlorine gas needed based on the stoichiometry of the reaction\nFrom the balanced chemical equation, 1 mol of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid requires 2 mol of chlorine gas.\n\n0.2809 mol of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid * (2 mol Cl2 / 1 mol C6H3Cl2COOH) = 0.5618 mol of Cl2\n\nStep 4: Calculate the grams of chlorine gas needed based on the molar mass of chlorine gas\nMolar mass of chlorine gas = 70.9 g/mol\n\n0.5618 mol of Cl2 * (70.9 g / 1 mol) = 39.83 g of Cl2\n\nStep 5: Adjust the amount of chlorine gas needed based on the reaction yield\nSince the reaction yield is 80%, we need to divide the amount of chlorine gas needed by the reaction yield.\n\n39.83 g of Cl2 / 0.80 = 49.79 g of Cl2\n\nTherefore, 49.79 grams of chlorine gas is needed to produce 50 grams of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid from benzoic acid with a reaction yield of 80%."
