    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant (K) for the given electrochemical reaction, we first need to determine the standard cell potential (Eº_cell) for the reaction. The standard cell potential can be calculated using the standard reduction potentials of the half-reactions:\n\nEº_cell = Eº_cathode - Eº_anode\n\nIn this case, the reduction half-reaction is:\n$\\ce{Fe^3+ + e^- -> Fe^2+}$ with Eº = +0.77V\n\nThe oxidation half-reaction is:\n$\\ce{2I^- -> I2 + 2e^- }$ with Eº = +0.54V\n\nSince the reduction potential of the iron half-reaction is greater than the iodine half-reaction, the iron half-reaction will act as the cathode and the iodine half-reaction will act as the anode.\n\nEº_cell = (+0.77V) - (+0.54V) = +0.23V\n\nNow, we can use the Nernst equation to relate the standard cell potential to the equilibrium constant. The Nernst equation is:\n\nEº_cell = - (RT/nF) * ln(K)\n\nWhere R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin (298 K), n is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the balanced redox reaction (2 moles in this case), and F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol).\n\nRearranging the Nernst equation to solve for K, we get:\n\nln(K) = - (nFEº_cell) / (RT)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nln(K) = - (2 * 96,485 C/mol * 0.23V) / (8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K)\n\nln(K) ≈ - 11.04\n\nTo find K, we take the exponential of both sides:\n\nK = e^(-11.04) ≈ 1.63 × 10^(-5)\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant for the given electrochemical reaction at 298 K is approximately 1.63 × 10^(-5)."
