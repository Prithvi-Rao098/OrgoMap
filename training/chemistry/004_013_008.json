    "message_1": "What is the amount of CuSO4 present in a given sample using coulometry if a constant current of 50 mA is passed through the sample for 30 minutes, and 30.6 mA-h of charge is consumed in the process?",
    "message_2": "To determine the amount of CuSO4 present in the sample, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the given current and time to coulombs (charge).\n2. Calculate the moles of electrons transferred.\n3. Determine the moles of CuSO4.\n4. Calculate the mass of CuSO4.\n\nStep 1: Convert current and time to coulombs\nCurrent (I) = 50 mA = 50 x 10^(-3) A\nTime (t) = 30 minutes = 30 x 60 seconds\n\nCharge (Q) = I x t\nQ = (50 x 10^(-3) A) x (30 x 60 s)\nQ = 90,000 x 10^(-3) C\nQ = 90 C\n\nStep 2: Calculate the moles of electrons transferred\nGiven that 30.6 mA-h of charge is consumed, we need to convert this to coulombs as well.\n\nCharge consumed = 30.6 mA-h x (1000 mA/A) x (3600 s/h)\nCharge consumed = 30.6 A-s\n\nMoles of electrons (n) = Charge consumed / Faraday's constant\nn = 30.6 A-s / 96485 C/mol\nn ≈ 0.000317 mol\n\nStep 3: Determine the moles of CuSO4\nThe balanced equation for the reduction of CuSO4 is:\n\nCuSO4 + 2e- → Cu + SO4^2-\n\nFrom the stoichiometry, 1 mole of CuSO4 requires 2 moles of electrons. Therefore,\n\nMoles of CuSO4 = Moles of electrons / 2\nMoles of CuSO4 ≈ 0.000317 mol / 2\nMoles of CuSO4 ≈ 0.0001585 mol\n\nStep 4: Calculate the mass of CuSO4\nMolar mass of CuSO4 = 63.5 (Cu) + 32 (S) + 4 x 16 (O) = 159.5 g/mol\n\nMass of CuSO4 = Moles of CuSO4 x Molar mass of CuSO4\nMass of CuSO4 ≈ 0.0001585 mol x 159.5 g/mol\nMass of CuSO4 ≈ 0.0253 g\n\nTherefore, the amount of CuSO4 present in the given sample is approximately 0.0253 grams."
