    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of molarity and the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide:\n\nH2SO4 + 2NaOH → Na2SO4 + 2H2O\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of H2SO4 reacts with 2 moles of NaOH. Now, we can use the formula:\n\nmoles of H2SO4 = moles of NaOH / 2\n\nFirst, let's find the moles of NaOH:\n\nmoles of NaOH = Molarity × Volume\nmoles of NaOH = 0.1 M × 0.025 L (converting 25 mL to liters)\nmoles of NaOH = 0.0025 moles\n\nNow, we can find the moles of H2SO4:\n\nmoles of H2SO4 = moles of NaOH / 2\nmoles of H2SO4 = 0.0025 moles / 2\nmoles of H2SO4 = 0.00125 moles\n\nFinally, we can find the volume of 0.2 M H2SO4 required:\n\nVolume = moles of H2SO4 / Molarity\nVolume = 0.00125 moles / 0.2 M\nVolume = 0.00625 L\n\nConverting liters to milliliters:\n\nVolume = 0.00625 L × 1000 mL/L\nVolume = 6.25 mL\n\nSo, 6.25 mL of 0.2 M sulfuric acid is required to neutralize 25 mL of 0.1 M sodium hydroxide."
