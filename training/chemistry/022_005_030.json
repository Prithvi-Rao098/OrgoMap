    "message_1": "What is the complete combustion formula of propane (C3H8) and what products are produced during the reaction?",
    "message_2": "The complete combustion of propane (C3H8) occurs when it reacts with oxygen (O2) to produce carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nC3H8 + 5O2 â†’ 3CO2 + 4H2O\n\nIn this reaction, propane combines with oxygen to produce 3 molecules of carbon dioxide and 4 molecules of water."
