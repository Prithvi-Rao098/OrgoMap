    "message_2": "To calculate the heat of hydration for the reaction, we first need to determine the number of moles of MgSO4•7H2O that are present in the 3.50 g sample. The molar mass of MgSO4•7H2O is:\n\nMg = 24.31 g/mol\nS = 32.07 g/mol\nO4 = 4 × 16.00 g/mol = 64.00 g/mol\n7H2O = 7 × (2 × 1.01 g/mol + 16.00 g/mol) = 7 × 18.02 g/mol = 126.14 g/mol\n\nMolar mass of MgSO4•7H2O = 24.31 + 32.07 + 64.00 + 126.14 = 246.52 g/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of moles of MgSO4•7H2O in the 3.50 g sample:\n\nmoles = mass / molar mass = 3.50 g / 246.52 g/mol = 0.0142 mol\n\nNext, we can use the molar heat of hydration to determine the heat released when these moles of MgSO4•7H2O are dissolved in water:\n\nheat of hydration = moles × molar heat of hydration = 0.0142 mol × (-90.39 kJ/mol) = -1.283 kJ\n\nTherefore, the heat of hydration for the reaction between 3.50 g of MgSO4•7H2O and water at 25 °C is -1.283 kJ."
