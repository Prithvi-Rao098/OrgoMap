    "message_2": "The rate law for a reaction is given by the equation:\n\nRate = k [A]^m [B]^n\n\nwhere Rate is the reaction rate, k is the rate constant, [A] and [B] are the concentrations of the reactants, and m and n are the reaction orders with respect to the reactants.\n\nIn this case, the reaction is:\n\nH2 (g) + I2 (g) ⟶ 2HI (g)\n\nFrom the given information, when the concentration of hydrogen gas (H2) is doubled, the reaction rate increases by a factor of four. This means that the reaction is second order with respect to hydrogen gas (m = 2).\n\nWhen the concentration of iodine gas (I2) is doubled, the reaction rate remains the same, which means that the reaction is zero order with respect to iodine gas (n = 0).\n\nTherefore, the rate law for this reaction is:\n\nRate = k [H2]^2 [I2]^0\n\nSince any number raised to the power of 0 is 1, the rate law simplifies to:\n\nRate = k [H2]^2"
