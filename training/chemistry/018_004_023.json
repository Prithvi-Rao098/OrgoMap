    "message_2": "To determine the activation energy (Ea) of the reaction, we can use the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk = Ae^(-Ea/RT)\n\nwhere k is the rate constant, A is the pre-exponential factor, Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nWe have two sets of data: k1 = 0.0016 at T1 = 298 K and k2 = 0.0032 at T2 = 308 K. We can set up two equations using the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk1 = Ae^(-Ea/R*T1)\nk2 = Ae^(-Ea/R*T2)\n\nTo solve for Ea, we can divide the second equation by the first equation:\n\nk2/k1 = e^(-Ea/R*T2) / e^(-Ea/R*T1)\n\n0.0032/0.0016 = e^(-Ea/8.314*308) / e^(-Ea/8.314*298)\n\n2 = e^(-Ea/8.314*308) / e^(-Ea/8.314*298)\n\nNow, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(2) = (-Ea/8.314*308) - (-Ea/8.314*298)\n\n0.693 = (-Ea/8.314*308) + (Ea/8.314*298)\n\nNow, we can solve for Ea:\n\nEa = 0.693 * 8.314 * 308 * 298 / (308 - 298)\n\nEa ≈ 16845.6 J/mol\n\nThe activation energy of the reaction between hydrogen peroxide and iodide ions is approximately 16,846 J/mol."
