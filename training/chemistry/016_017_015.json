    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the complete oxidation of 12.5 g of methane gas, we need to first determine the balanced chemical equation for the reaction. The complete oxidation of methane (CH4) involves reacting it with oxygen (O2) to produce carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O):\n\nCH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l)\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of moles of methane involved in the reaction. The molar mass of methane is:\n\nCH4 = 12.01 g/mol (C) + 4 * 1.01 g/mol (H) = 16.05 g/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the moles of methane:\n\nmoles of CH4 = mass / molar mass = 12.5 g / 16.05 g/mol ≈ 0.778 moles\n\nNow we need to calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction using the enthalpy of formation values given:\n\nΔH_reaction = [1 * ΔH_f(CO2) + 2 * ΔH_f(H2O)] - [ΔH_f(CH4) + 2 * ΔH_f(O2)]\n\nSince the enthalpy of formation for an element in its standard state is zero, ΔH_f(O2) = 0. The enthalpy of formation for CO2(g) can be calculated using the given values for CH4(g) and H2O(l):\n\nΔH_f(CO2) = ΔH_f(H2O) - ΔH_f(CH4) - ΔH_combustion(CH4)\n\nThe enthalpy of combustion of methane (ΔH_combustion(CH4)) is the enthalpy change for the complete oxidation of one mole of methane. It can be calculated using the heat capacity of water (4.18 J/g°C) and the mass and temperature change of the water:\n\nq = mcΔT\nq = 150 g * 4.18 J/g°C * (35°C - 25°C) = 6270 J = 6.27 kJ\n\nSince 0.778 moles of methane are combusted, the enthalpy of combustion for one mole of methane is:\n\nΔH_combustion(CH4) = 6.27 kJ / 0.778 moles ≈ 8.06 kJ/mol\n\nNow we can calculate the enthalpy of formation for CO2(g):\n\nΔH_f(CO2) = -285.8 kJ/mol - (-74.8 kJ/mol) - 8.06 kJ/mol ≈ -202.94 kJ/mol\n\nFinally, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nΔH_reaction = [1 * (-202.94 kJ/mol) + 2 * (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [-74.8 kJ/mol + 2 * 0]\nΔH_reaction = -202.94 kJ/mol - 571.6 kJ/mol + 74.8 kJ/mol ≈ -699.74 kJ/mol\n\nSince there are 0.778 moles of methane, the total enthalpy change for the complete oxidation of 12.5 g of methane is:\n\nΔH_total = 0.778 moles * -699.74 kJ/mol ≈ -544.19 kJ"
