    "message_2": "In ethanol (C2H5OH), there are three types of intermolecular forces present:\n\n1. Hydrogen bonding: This is the strongest intermolecular force present in ethanol. It occurs between the oxygen atom of the hydroxyl group (OH) in one ethanol molecule and the hydrogen atom of the hydroxyl group in another ethanol molecule.\n\n2. Dipole-dipole interactions: Ethanol is a polar molecule due to the presence of the polar hydroxyl group (OH). The positively charged hydrogen atom of the hydroxyl group in one ethanol molecule is attracted to the negatively charged oxygen atom of the hydroxyl group in another ethanol molecule.\n\n3. London dispersion forces: These are the weakest intermolecular forces and are present in all molecules, including ethanol. They result from temporary fluctuations in electron distribution around the molecule, which create temporary dipoles that attract other molecules."
