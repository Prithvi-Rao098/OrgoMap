    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat required to melt 20 grams of ice at 0°C and convert it to liquid water at 0°C, we will use the formula:\n\nq = n × ΔHf\n\nwhere q is the heat required, n is the number of moles of the substance, and ΔHf is the enthalpy of fusion.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the number of moles of ice\nThe molar mass of water (H2O) is 18.015 g/mol. To find the number of moles (n) in 20 grams of ice, we will use the formula:\n\nn = mass / molar mass\n\nn = 20 g / 18.015 g/mol\nn ≈ 1.11 moles\n\nStep 2: Calculate the heat required\nNow that we have the number of moles, we can use the formula q = n × ΔHf to find the heat required to melt the ice:\n\nq = 1.11 moles × 6.01 kJ/mol\nq ≈ 6.67 kJ\n\nTherefore, approximately 6.67 kJ of heat is required to melt 20 grams of ice at 0°C and convert it to liquid water at 0°C."
