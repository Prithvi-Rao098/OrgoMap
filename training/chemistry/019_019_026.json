    "message_1": "What is the standard enthalpy change for the reaction 2CO(g) + O2(g) → 2CO2(g) at standard conditions, given that the standard enthalpy of formation for CO, O2, and CO2 are -110.5 kJ/mol,-393.5 kJ/mol, and -393.5 kJ/mol, respectively?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the formula:\n\nΔH° = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH° is the standard enthalpy change, and ΔHf° is the standard enthalpy of formation.\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\n2CO(g) + O2(g) → 2CO2(g)\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation for CO is -110.5 kJ/mol, for O2 is 0 kJ/mol (since it is an element in its standard state), and for CO2 is -393.5 kJ/mol.\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nΔH° = [2 × (-393.5 kJ/mol)] - [2 × (-110.5 kJ/mol) + 0]\n\nΔH° = (-787 kJ) - (-221 kJ)\n\nΔH° = -566 kJ\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change for the reaction is -566 kJ."
