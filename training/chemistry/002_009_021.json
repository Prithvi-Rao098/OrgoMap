    "message_1": "A sample of a compound contains 28.6% sodium, 46.8% sulfur, and 24.6% oxygen. Determine the empirical formula of this inorganic compound.",
    "message_2": "To determine the empirical formula of the compound, we need to convert the percentages into moles.\n\n1. Assume we have a 100 g sample of the compound. This means we have:\n- 28.6 g of sodium (Na)\n- 46.8 g of sulfur (S)\n- 24.6 g of oxygen (O)\n\n2. Convert the mass of each element into moles by dividing by their respective molar masses:\n- Moles of Na = 28.6 g / (22.99 g/mol) ≈ 1.243 mol\n- Moles of S = 46.8 g / (32.07 g/mol) ≈ 1.459 mol\n- Moles of O = 24.6 g / (16.00 g/mol) ≈ 1.538 mol\n\n3. Divide each mole value by the smallest mole value to get the mole ratio:\n- Na: 1.243 / 1.243 ≈ 1\n- S: 1.459 / 1.243 ≈ 1.17\n- O: 1.538 / 1.243 ≈ 1.24\n\n4. Round the mole ratios to the nearest whole number:\n- Na: 1\n- S: 1\n- O: 1\n\n5. Write the empirical formula using the whole number mole ratios:\nThe empirical formula is NaSO."
