    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the neutralization reaction, we need to first determine the heat released during the reaction (q) and then divide by the moles of the limiting reactant.\n\nThe balanced equation for the neutralization reaction is:\n\nHCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H2O(l)\n\nSince both reactants have the same concentration and volume, they will react in a 1:1 ratio, and neither is in excess.\n\nFirst, let's find the heat released (q) using the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere m is the mass of the solution, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the temperature change.\n\nThe total volume of the solution is 25.0 mL + 25.0 mL = 50.0 mL. Assuming the density of the solution is approximately 1 g/mL (similar to water), the mass of the solution is 50.0 g.\n\nNow, we can calculate q:\n\nq = (50.0 g)(4.18 J/g°C)(5.0°C) = 1045 J\n\nNext, we need to determine the moles of the limiting reactant. We can use the volume and concentration of either HCl or NaOH since they react in a 1:1 ratio.\n\nmoles = (volume)(concentration) = (0.025 L)(0.100 mol/L) = 0.00250 mol\n\nFinally, we can calculate the standard enthalpy change (ΔH) by dividing the heat released by the moles of the limiting reactant:\n\nΔH = q / moles = 1045 J / 0.00250 mol = 418000 J/mol = 418 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the neutralization of 25.0 mL of 0.100 M hydrochloric acid with 25.0 mL of 0.100 M sodium hydroxide is 418 kJ/mol."
