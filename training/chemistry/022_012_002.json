    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of molarity and the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH):\n\nHCl + NaOH → NaCl + H2O\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that one mole of HCl reacts with one mole of NaOH. We can use the formula:\n\nmoles = molarity × volume\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of NaOH in the 25 mL of 0.1 M solution:\n\nmoles of NaOH = 0.1 M × 25 mL = 0.1 M × 0.025 L = 0.0025 moles\n\nSince the ratio of HCl to NaOH is 1:1, we need the same number of moles of HCl to neutralize the NaOH:\n\nmoles of HCl = 0.0025 moles\n\nNow we can find the volume of 0.2 M HCl solution required:\n\nvolume of HCl = moles of HCl / molarity of HCl = 0.0025 moles / 0.2 M = 0.0125 L\n\nConverting this to milliliters:\n\nvolume of HCl = 0.0125 L × 1000 mL/L = 12.5 mL\n\nSo, 12.5 mL of 0.2 M hydrochloric acid is required to neutralize 25 mL of 0.1 M sodium hydroxide solution."
