    "message_2": "The magnetic moment of a complex ion can be calculated using the formula:\n\nμ = √(n(n+2)) BM (Bohr Magneton)\n\nwhere n is the number of unpaired electrons.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the oxidation state of Fe in the [Fe(H2O)6]2+ complex ion. Since the overall charge of the complex ion is +2 and water (H2O) is a neutral ligand, the oxidation state of Fe is +2.\n\nFe in the +2 oxidation state has an electron configuration of [Ar] 3d6, which means it has 6 electrons in its 3d orbitals.\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of unpaired electrons. In the case of Fe2+, the 3d orbitals are filled as follows: ↑↓ ↑↓ ↑ ↑ ↑ (using Hund's rule). There are 4 unpaired electrons.\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic moment:\n\nμ = √(n(n+2)) BM\nμ = √(4(4+2)) BM\nμ = √(4(6)) BM\nμ = √(24) BM\nμ ≈ 4.90 BM\n\nSo, the magnetic moment of the [Fe(H2O)6]2+ complex ion is approximately 4.90 Bohr Magnetons."
