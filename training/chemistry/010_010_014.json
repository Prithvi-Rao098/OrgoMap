    "message_2": "To calculate the maximum power output of a voltaic cell, we can use the formula:\n\nPower (P) = Voltage (V) × Current (I)\n\nWe are given the standard potential difference (voltage) between the anode and cathode as 1.23 V and the current density as 10 A/cm². However, we need the total current (I) to calculate the power output. To find the total current, we need to know the surface area of the electrodes.\n\nAssuming the surface area (A) of the electrodes is given in cm², we can calculate the total current (I) using the formula:\n\nCurrent (I) = Current density × Surface area (A)\n\nI = 10 A/cm² × A\n\nNow, we can calculate the power output using the formula:\n\nPower (P) = Voltage (V) × Current (I)\n\nP = 1.23 V × (10 A/cm² × A)\n\nP = 12.3 A × A\n\nThe maximum power output of the voltaic cell depends on the surface area of the electrodes. The larger the surface area, the higher the power output."
