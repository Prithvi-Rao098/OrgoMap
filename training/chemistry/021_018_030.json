    "message_1": "What is the predicted boiling point of a substance with strongest intermolecular forces, given that its molecular weight and structure are identical to a substance with weaker intermolecular forces and a boiling point of 100°C? How would the predicted boiling point change if the molecular weight of the stronger substance was doubled?",
    "message_2": "It is difficult to provide an exact boiling point for the substance with stronger intermolecular forces without more specific information about the substances involved. However, we can provide a general prediction.\n\nSince the substance with stronger intermolecular forces has the same molecular weight and structure as the substance with weaker intermolecular forces, we can assume that the stronger substance will have a higher boiling point than the weaker substance. This is because stronger intermolecular forces require more energy to overcome, resulting in a higher boiling point. If the weaker substance has a boiling point of 100°C, the stronger substance will have a boiling point higher than 100°C.\n\nIf the molecular weight of the stronger substance was doubled, the boiling point would likely increase further. This is because an increase in molecular weight generally leads to an increase in the strength of intermolecular forces, such as van der Waals forces, which in turn requires more energy to overcome and results in a higher boiling point. However, without more specific information about the substances involved, it is not possible to provide an exact value for the new boiling point."
