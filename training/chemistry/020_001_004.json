    "message_1": "Calculate the equilibrium constant, Kc, for the reaction below at 25°C if the concentration of CO2 is 1.2 M, the concentration of H2 is 0.8 M and the concentration of CO is 0.6 M.\n\nCO2(g) + H2(g) ⇌ CO(g) + H2O(g)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant Kc, we need to know the concentrations of all species involved in the reaction at equilibrium. However, the concentration of H2O is not provided. We can use the initial concentrations and the stoichiometry of the reaction to determine the change in concentrations and find the equilibrium concentration of H2O.\n\nLet's denote the change in concentration of CO2 and H2 as x. Since the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1:1:1, the change in concentration of CO and H2O will also be x.\n\nAt equilibrium, the concentrations will be:\nCO2: 1.2 - x\nH2: 0.8 - x\nCO: 0.6 + x\nH2O: x\n\nNow we can write the expression for Kc:\n\nKc = [CO][H2O] / ([CO2][H2])\n\nWe need to find the value of x to determine the equilibrium concentrations and calculate Kc. However, without any additional information, such as the value of Kc or any equilibrium concentrations, we cannot solve for x and determine the equilibrium constant Kc for this reaction at 25°C."
