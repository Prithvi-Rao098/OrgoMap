    "message_2": "The standard electrode potential for the given cell reaction is already provided. The reaction is:\n\nFe3+(aq) + e- → Fe2+(aq)\n\nThe standard electrode potential for this reaction, E°Fe3+/Fe2+, is given as 0.77 V. Therefore, there is no need to calculate it further. The answer is:\n\nE° = 0.77 V"
