    "message_2": "The balanced equation for the oxidation of ethanol (C2H5OH) to ethanoic acid (CH3COOH) is:\n\nC2H5OH + O2 â†’ CH3COOH + H2O\n\nIn ethanol, the oxidation state of the carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group (C-OH) is -1, while the other carbon atom is -3.\n\nIn ethanoic acid, the oxidation state of the carbon atom in the carboxyl group (COOH) is +3, while the other carbon atom remains at -3.\n\nSo, during the oxidation process, the carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group in ethanol increases its oxidation state from -1 to +3."
