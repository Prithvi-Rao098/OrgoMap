    "message_2": "To calculate the heat of formation of water, we need to consider the bond energies of the reactants and products. The balanced chemical equation for the formation of water is:\n\nH2 (g) + 1/2 O2 (g) → H2O (l)\n\nFirst, let's consider the bond energies of the reactants:\n1. One H-H bond in H2 molecule: 1 × 436 kJ/mol = 436 kJ/mol\n2. Since there is only 1/2 O2 molecule, we don't need to consider the O=O bond energy in this calculation.\n\nNow, let's consider the bond energies of the product:\n1. Two O-H bonds in H2O molecule: 2 × 463 kJ/mol = 926 kJ/mol\n\nThe heat of formation (ΔHf) can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nΔHf = Σ (bond energies of products) - Σ (bond energies of reactants)\n\nΔHf = 926 kJ/mol - 436 kJ/mol = 490 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the heat of formation of water (H2O) is 490 kJ/mol."
