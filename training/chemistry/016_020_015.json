    "message_1": "What is the enthalpy of desorption of water from a silica gel surface, given that the initial weight of the silica gel was 5 g, and after desorption, the weight decreased to 3.5 g? The specific heat capacity of silica gel is 0.5 J/g°C and the initial temperature was 25°C, while the final temperature was 40°C. Assume that the process is reversible and the pressure is constant at 1 atm.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of desorption of water from the silica gel surface, we first need to determine the amount of heat absorbed by the silica gel during the temperature change.\n\n1. Calculate the mass of water desorbed:\nInitial mass of silica gel = 5 g\nFinal mass of silica gel = 3.5 g\nMass of water desorbed = 5 g - 3.5 g = 1.5 g\n\n2. Calculate the heat absorbed by the silica gel:\nSpecific heat capacity of silica gel = 0.5 J/g°C\nInitial temperature = 25°C\nFinal temperature = 40°C\nTemperature change = 40°C - 25°C = 15°C\n\nHeat absorbed by silica gel (q) = mass of silica gel × specific heat capacity × temperature change\nq = 3.5 g × 0.5 J/g°C × 15°C = 26.25 J\n\n3. Calculate the enthalpy of desorption per gram of water (ΔH):\nSince the process is reversible and at constant pressure, the enthalpy change is equal to the heat absorbed by the silica gel.\n\nΔH = q / mass of water desorbed\nΔH = 26.25 J / 1.5 g = 17.5 J/g\n\nThe enthalpy of desorption of water from the silica gel surface is 17.5 J/g."
