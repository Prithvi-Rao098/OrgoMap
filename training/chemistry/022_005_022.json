    "message_2": "To determine the theoretical amount of oxygen required to completely combust 10 grams of methane (CH4) gas and the mass of carbon dioxide (CO2) produced in the reaction, we need to use stoichiometry and the balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane:\n\nCH4 + 2O2 â†’ CO2 + 2H2O\n\nFirst, we need to find the molar mass of each compound involved:\n\nMolar mass of CH4 = 12.01 (C) + 4 * 1.01 (H) = 16.05 g/mol\nMolar mass of O2 = 2 * 16.00 (O) = 32.00 g/mol\nMolar mass of CO2 = 12.01 (C) + 2 * 16.00 (O) = 44.01 g/mol\n\nNext, we'll convert the mass of methane to moles:\n\n10 g CH4 * (1 mol CH4 / 16.05 g CH4) = 0.623 mol CH4\n\nNow, using the stoichiometry from the balanced equation, we can find the moles of oxygen required and the moles of carbon dioxide produced:\n\n0.623 mol CH4 * (2 mol O2 / 1 mol CH4) = 1.246 mol O2\n0.623 mol CH4 * (1 mol CO2 / 1 mol CH4) = 0.623 mol CO2\n\nFinally, we'll convert the moles of oxygen and carbon dioxide back to grams:\n\n1.246 mol O2 * (32.00 g O2 / 1 mol O2) = 39.87 g O2\n0.623 mol CO2 * (44.01 g CO2 / 1 mol CO2) = 27.41 g CO2\n\nSo, the theoretical amount of oxygen required to completely combust 10 grams of methane is 39.87 grams, and the mass of carbon dioxide produced in the reaction is 27.41 grams."
