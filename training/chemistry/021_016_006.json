    "message_2": "To find the electronegativity difference between sulfur (S) and oxygen (O) in the molecule SO2, we need to know the electronegativity values of both elements.\n\nThe electronegativity of sulfur (S) is 2.58, and the electronegativity of oxygen (O) is 3.44 (according to the Pauling scale).\n\nThe electronegativity difference between S and O is:\n\n3.44 (O) - 2.58 (S) = 0.86\n\nSo, the electronegativity difference between sulfur and oxygen in the molecule SO2 is 0.86."
