The electrode on the right side is made of silver and has a surface area of 25 cm².\n- The distance between each electrode and the solution is 0.5 cm.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the resistance of the electrochemical cell, we can use the formula:\n\nResistance (R) = Resistivity (ρ) × Length (L) / Area (A)\n\nHowever, we are given the conductivity (κ) of the electrolyte solution, not the resistivity. Resistivity (ρ) and conductivity (κ) are inversely related:\n\nResistivity (ρ) = 1 / Conductivity (κ)\n\nFirst, let's find the resistivity of the electrolyte solution:\n\nρ = 1 / (2.5 × 10⁻⁴ S/cm) = 1 / 0.00025 S/cm = 4000 Ω·cm\n\nNow, we can calculate the resistance of the electrochemical cell. The length (L) is the separation between the electrodes (2 cm), and the area (A) is the total area of the cell (50 cm²):\n\nR = (4000 Ω·cm × 2 cm) / 50 cm² = 8000 Ω·cm² / 50 cm² = 160 Ω\n\nTherefore, the resistance of the electrochemical cell is 160 Ω."
