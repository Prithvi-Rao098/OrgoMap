    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the given reaction, we can use the formula:\n\nΔH = ΣnΔHf°(products) - ΣnΔHf°(reactants)\n\nwhere n is the stoichiometric coefficient of each species in the reaction, and ΔHf° is the standard enthalpy of formation of each species.\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\nC2H5OH(l) + 3O2(g) → 2CO2(g) + 3H2O(l)\n\nThe enthalpy change (ΔH) can be calculated as follows:\n\nΔH = [2 × (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 3 × (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [(-277.6 kJ/mol) + 3 × 0 kJ/mol]\n\nNote that the standard enthalpy of formation for O2(g) is 0 kJ/mol because it is in its standard state.\n\nΔH = [-787.0 kJ + (-857.4 kJ)] - [-277.6 kJ]\n\nΔH = -1644.4 kJ + 277.6 kJ\n\nΔH = -1366.8 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the enthalpy change for the given reaction is -1366.8 kJ/mol."
