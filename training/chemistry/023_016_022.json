    "message_1": "What is the stoichiometric ratio of aniline to chlorine gas required for the preparation of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline based on the balanced chemical equation?",
    "message_2": "To determine the stoichiometric ratio of aniline to chlorine gas for the preparation of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction. The reaction involves two steps: nitration and chlorination.\n\n1. Nitration of aniline:\nC6H7N + HNO3 -> C6H6N2O2 + H2O\n\n2. Chlorination of 4-nitroaniline:\nC6H6N2O2 + Cl2 -> C6H5ClN2O2 + HCl\n\nNow, let's find the stoichiometric ratio of aniline to chlorine gas:\n\nIn the first reaction, 1 mole of aniline reacts with 1 mole of nitric acid to produce 1 mole of 4-nitroaniline.\nIn the second reaction, 1 mole of 4-nitroaniline reacts with 1 mole of chlorine gas to produce 1 mole of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline.\n\nTherefore, the stoichiometric ratio of aniline to chlorine gas is 1:1."
