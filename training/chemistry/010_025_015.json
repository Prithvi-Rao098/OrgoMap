    "message_2": "To calculate the activation energy (Ea) of the reaction, we will use the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk = A * exp(-Ea / (R * T))\n\nwhere k is the rate constant, A is the pre-exponential factor, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin:\n\nT = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\n\nNow, we can rearrange the Arrhenius equation to solve for Ea:\n\nEa = -R * T * ln(k / A)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nEa = -8.314 J/mol·K * 298.15 K * ln(1.0 × 10^-3 s^-1 / 8.0 × 10^7 s^-1)\nEa = -8.314 * 298.15 * ln(1.25 × 10^-11)\nEa ≈ 193,000 J/mol\n\nThe activation energy for the electrochemical reaction is approximately 193 kJ/mol."
