    "message_2": "To calculate the bond order and predict the magnetic behavior of carbon monoxide (CO) using molecular orbital theory, we first need to determine the electronic configuration of CO.\n\nCarbon (C) has an atomic number of 6, so it has 6 electrons. Oxygen (O) has an atomic number of 8, so it has 8 electrons. Therefore, CO has a total of 14 electrons.\n\nNow, let's fill the molecular orbitals according to the energy levels and the aufbau principle. The order of energy levels for CO is as follows:\n\n1. σ(2s)\n2. σ*(2s)\n3. σ(2pz)\n4. π(2px) = π(2py)\n5. π*(2px) = π*(2py)\n6. σ*(2pz)\n\nNow we fill the orbitals with the 14 electrons:\n\n1. σ(2s) - 2 electrons\n2. σ*(2s) - 2 electrons\n3. σ(2pz) - 2 electrons\n4. π(2px) = π(2py) - 4 electrons (2 in each)\n5. π*(2px) = π*(2py) - 4 electrons (2 in each)\n6. σ*(2pz) - 0 electrons\n\nNext, we calculate the bond order using the formula:\n\nBond order = (number of electrons in bonding orbitals - number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\n\nBond order = (8 - 6) / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1\n\nThe bond order of CO is 1, which indicates a single bond between the carbon and oxygen atoms.\n\nTo predict the magnetic behavior, we need to check for unpaired electrons in the molecular orbitals. In CO, all the electrons are paired, so it is diamagnetic.\n\nIn conclusion, according to molecular orbital theory, carbon monoxide (CO) has a bond order of 1 and is diamagnetic."
