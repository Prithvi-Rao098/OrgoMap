    "message_1": "What is the percentage of copper in a sample of brass weighing 5.67 grams, if the sample was dissolved in nitric acid, precipitated as copper (II) oxide, and then weighed as copper (II) oxide to give a weight of 2.49 grams? Use gravimetric analysis to calculate the percentage of copper in the brass sample.",
    "message_2": "To determine the percentage of copper in the brass sample, we will first need to find the mass of copper in the copper (II) oxide sample, and then use that to calculate the percentage of copper in the original brass sample.\n\n1. Calculate the moles of copper (II) oxide (CuO) in the 2.49 grams sample:\n\nMolar mass of CuO = (63.55 g/mol for Cu) + (16.00 g/mol for O) = 79.55 g/mol\n\nmoles of CuO = mass of CuO / molar mass of CuO\nmoles of CuO = 2.49 g / 79.55 g/mol = 0.0313 mol\n\n2. Calculate the moles of copper (Cu) in the copper (II) oxide sample:\n\nSince the ratio of Cu to CuO is 1:1, the moles of Cu will be equal to the moles of CuO.\n\nmoles of Cu = 0.0313 mol\n\n3. Calculate the mass of copper (Cu) in the sample:\n\nmass of Cu = moles of Cu × molar mass of Cu\nmass of Cu = 0.0313 mol × 63.55 g/mol = 1.989 g\n\n4. Calculate the percentage of copper in the brass sample:\n\npercentage of Cu = (mass of Cu / mass of brass sample) × 100\npercentage of Cu = (1.989 g / 5.67 g) × 100 = 35.07 %\n\nTherefore, the percentage of copper in the brass sample is approximately 35.07%."
