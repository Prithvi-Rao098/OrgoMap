    "message_1": "What mass of copper will be deposited on a cathode when a current of 2.5 A is passed for a duration of 5 minutes through a solution of copper sulfate using a cathode of 200 cm2 area? (Assume the charge on each copper ion is 2+ and the atomic weight of Cu is 63.5 g/mol).",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use Faraday's laws of electrolysis. The first law states that the mass of a substance deposited on an electrode during electrolysis is directly proportional to the quantity of electricity passed through the electrolyte.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total charge passed through the electrolyte. The charge (Q) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nQ = I × t\n\nwhere I is the current (in amperes) and t is the time (in seconds).\n\nGiven, current (I) = 2.5 A and time (t) = 5 minutes = 5 × 60 = 300 seconds.\n\nNow, let's calculate the charge:\n\nQ = 2.5 A × 300 s = 750 C (coulombs)\n\nNext, we need to find the number of moles of electrons passed through the electrolyte. To do this, we will use the Faraday constant (F), which is the charge of one mole of electrons and is approximately 96,485 C/mol.\n\nNumber of moles of electrons = Q / F\n\nNumber of moles of electrons = 750 C / 96,485 C/mol ≈ 0.00777 mol\n\nSince the charge on each copper ion is 2+, it means that two moles of electrons are required to deposit one mole of copper. Therefore, the number of moles of copper deposited is half the number of moles of electrons:\n\nNumber of moles of copper = 0.00777 mol / 2 = 0.003885 mol\n\nNow, we can find the mass of copper deposited using the atomic weight of copper (63.5 g/mol):\n\nMass of copper = Number of moles of copper × Atomic weight of copper\n\nMass of copper = 0.003885 mol × 63.5 g/mol ≈ 0.2466 g\n\nTherefore, the mass of copper deposited on the cathode is approximately 0.2466 grams."
