    "message_2": "The most efficient catalyst for the synthesis of polyacrylonitrile from acrylonitrile monomer is an initiator, typically a redox system or a persulfate. These initiators help to start the polymerization process by generating free radicals. Examples of efficient catalysts include ammonium persulfate, potassium persulfate, and azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN). The choice of catalyst depends on the specific reaction conditions and desired properties of the final product."
