    "message_2": "I would choose option C) Nucleophilic substitution of 1-chlorobutane with sodium ethoxide to prepare a symmetric ether with the molecular formula C4H10O.\n\nReasoning:\nA symmetric ether has the same alkyl groups on both sides of the oxygen atom. In this case, the ether would be diethyl ether (C2H5-O-C2H5). \n\nA) Williamson ether synthesis using sodium hydride and 1-bromobutane would result in the formation of an unsymmetrical ether, butoxybutane (C4H9-O-C4H9), which does not meet the requirement of a symmetric ether.\n\nB) Acid-catalyzed dehydration of 2-butanol would result in the formation of an alkene (1-butene or 2-butene) rather than an ether.\n\nD) Ring-opening of an epoxide with ethylamine would result in the formation of an amino alcohol, not an ether.\n\nChemical equation for option C:\n1-chlorobutane (C4H9Cl) + sodium ethoxide (C2H5ONa) -> diethyl ether (C2H5-O-C2H5) + sodium chloride (NaCl)"
