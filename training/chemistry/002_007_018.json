    "message_2": "When sodium ferrocyanide (Na4Fe(CN)6) reacts with copper(II) sulfate (CuSO4), the products formed are copper(II) hexacyanoferrate(II) and sodium sulfate. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\n2 CuSO4 + Na4Fe(CN)6 â†’ 2 Cu2[Fe(CN)6] + 4 Na2SO4\n\nCopper(II) hexacyanoferrate(II) (Cu2[Fe(CN)6]) is a coordination compound with a deep blue color, and sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) is a white crystalline solid."
