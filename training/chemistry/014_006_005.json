    "message_2": "The coordination number of the transition metal ion in the complex [Fe(H₂O)₆]²⁺ is 6. This is because there are six water molecules (H₂O) surrounding the central iron (Fe) atom as ligands.\n\nThe oxidation state of the iron (Fe) in the complex [Fe(H₂O)₆]²⁺ is +2. This is indicated by the ²⁺ charge on the complex, which means that the iron atom has lost two electrons."
