    "message_1": "What is the polarity of the bond between carbon and oxygen in carbon monoxide (CO)?",
    "message_2": "The bond between carbon and oxygen in carbon monoxide (CO) is polar. This is because oxygen is more electronegative than carbon, resulting in an unequal sharing of electrons and creating a dipole moment in the molecule. The oxygen atom attracts the shared electrons more strongly, giving it a partial negative charge, while the carbon atom has a partial positive charge."
