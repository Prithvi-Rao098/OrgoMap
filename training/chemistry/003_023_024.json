    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of 1.50 moles of methane, we can use the given information about the heat released during the reaction. The balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane is:\n\nCH₄(g) + 2O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l)\n\nThe given heat released is 890.4 kJ for the combustion of methane. This value is usually given per mole of methane. Therefore, we can calculate the enthalpy change for 1.50 moles of methane as follows:\n\nEnthalpy change (ΔH) = (Heat released per mole of methane) × (Number of moles of methane)\nΔH = (-890.4 kJ/mol) × (1.50 mol)\n\nNote that the heat released is negative because it is an exothermic reaction (heat is released to the surroundings).\n\nΔH = -1335.6 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change for the combustion of 1.50 moles of methane under standard conditions is -1335.6 kJ."
