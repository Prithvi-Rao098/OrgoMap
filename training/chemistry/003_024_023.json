    "message_1": "What is the rate constant k for the decomposition of N2O5 (g) to NO2(g) and O2(g) at 250°C if the initial concentration of N2O5 is 0.10 M and the half-life for the reaction is 120 seconds?",
    "message_2": "The decomposition of N2O5 can be represented by the following reaction:\n\nN2O5 (g) → 2 NO2 (g) + 1/2 O2 (g)\n\nSince the reaction is first-order, we can use the first-order half-life equation:\n\nt1/2 = 0.693 / k\n\nWhere t1/2 is the half-life and k is the rate constant.\n\nWe are given the half-life (t1/2) as 120 seconds. We can now solve for the rate constant (k):\n\n120 s = 0.693 / k\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for k:\n\nk = 0.693 / 120 s\n\nk ≈ 0.005775 s⁻¹\n\nSo, the rate constant k for the decomposition of N2O5 at 250°C is approximately 0.005775 s⁻¹."
