    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the combustion of propane, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants)\n\nFor the products, we have 3 moles of CO2 and 4 moles of H2O:\nΣ ΔHf°(products) = (3 mol CO2 × -393.5 kJ/mol CO2) + (4 mol H2O × -285.8 kJ/mol H2O)\nΣ ΔHf°(products) = (-1180.5 kJ) + (-1143.2 kJ)\nΣ ΔHf°(products) = -2323.7 kJ\n\nFor the reactants, we have 1 mole of C3H8 and 5 moles of O2. Since O2 is in its standard state, its ΔHf° is 0 kJ/mol:\nΣ ΔHf°(reactants) = (1 mol C3H8 × -103.8 kJ/mol C3H8) + (5 mol O2 × 0 kJ/mol O2)\nΣ ΔHf°(reactants) = -103.8 kJ\n\nNow, we can find the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the reaction:\nΔH = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants)\nΔH = -2323.7 kJ - (-103.8 kJ)\nΔH = -2219.9 kJ\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy change for the combustion of propane is -2219.9 kJ/mol."
