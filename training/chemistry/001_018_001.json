    "message_2": "To find the pH of a 0.1M solution of acetic acid, we can use the formula for the ionization constant (Ka) of a weak acid:\n\nKa = [H+][A-] / [HA]\n\nWhere [H+] is the concentration of hydrogen ions, [A-] is the concentration of acetate ions, and [HA] is the concentration of acetic acid.\n\nSince acetic acid is a weak acid, it will not completely dissociate in water. Therefore, we can assume that the change in concentration of acetic acid will be equal to the concentration of hydrogen ions produced, which we will represent as x:\n\nKa = x^2 / (0.1 - x)\n\nGiven the Ka value of acetic acid as 1.8 × 10^-5, we can now solve for x:\n\n1.8 × 10^-5 = x^2 / (0.1 - x)\n\nSince x is very small compared to 0.1, we can approximate (0.1 - x) as 0.1:\n\n1.8 × 10^-5 = x^2 / 0.1\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx^2 = 1.8 × 10^-5 × 0.1\nx^2 = 1.8 × 10^-6\nx = √(1.8 × 10^-6)\nx ≈ 1.34 × 10^-3\n\nNow that we have the concentration of hydrogen ions [H+], we can find the pH using the formula:\n\npH = -log[H+]\n\npH = -log(1.34 × 10^-3)\npH ≈ 2.87\n\nTherefore, the pH of a 0.1M solution of acetic acid at 25°C is approximately 2.87."
