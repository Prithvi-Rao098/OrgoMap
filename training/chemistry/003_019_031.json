    "message_2": "Based on the information provided, it is not possible to determine the exact chemical structure of the compound. However, we can make some educated guesses about the functional groups present in the compound.\n\n1. The 1H-NMR peak at 3 ppm suggests the presence of a methylene group (-CH2-) or a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to an electronegative atom like oxygen or nitrogen. This could indicate the presence of an ether (R-O-CH2-R'), amine (R-NH-CH2-R'), or ester (R-CO-O-CH2-R') functional group.\n\n2. The 13C-NMR peak at 125 ppm is indicative of a sp2 hybridized carbon atom, which is typically found in alkenes (C=C) or aromatic rings.\n\nWithout more information, such as additional NMR peaks or other spectroscopic data, it is impossible to determine the exact chemical structure of the compound. However, we can infer that the compound likely contains an alkene or aromatic ring and a functional group with an electronegative atom adjacent to a methylene or methyl group."
