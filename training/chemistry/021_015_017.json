    "message_2": "To determine the molecular geometry of CH3Cl using the VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) theory, follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the central atom: In CH3Cl, the central atom is carbon (C).\n\n2. Count the number of valence electrons: Carbon has 4 valence electrons, each hydrogen has 1 valence electron, and chlorine has 7 valence electrons. So, the total number of valence electrons is 4 + (3 Ã— 1) + 7 = 14.\n\n3. Determine the electron pair geometry: Carbon is surrounded by 4 atoms (3 hydrogens and 1 chlorine). Since there are no lone pairs on the central atom, the electron pair geometry is tetrahedral.\n\n4. Determine the molecular geometry: The molecular geometry is the same as the electron pair geometry since there are no lone pairs on the central atom. Therefore, the molecular geometry of CH3Cl is also tetrahedral.\n\nIn summary, the molecular geometry of CH3Cl is tetrahedral according to the VSEPR theory."
