    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant, Kc, we need to first find the equilibrium concentrations of all the species involved in the reaction. We can do this by setting up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table.\n\nFor the reaction: 2 SO2(g) + O2(g) ⇌ 2 SO3(g)\n\nInitial concentrations:\n[SO2] = 0.100 M\n[O2] = 0.200 M\n[SO3] = 0.300 M\n\nLet x be the change in concentration at equilibrium:\n\nChange in concentrations:\nΔ[SO2] = -2x\nΔ[O2] = -x\nΔ[SO3] = +2x\n\nEquilibrium concentrations:\n[SO2] = 0.100 - 2x\n[O2] = 0.200 - x\n[SO3] = 0.300 + 2x\n\nNow, we can write the expression for Kc:\n\nKc = [SO3]^2 / ([SO2]^2 * [O2])\n\nAt equilibrium, we can substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the Kc expression:\n\nKc = [(0.300 + 2x)^2] / ([(0.100 - 2x)^2] * (0.200 - x))\n\nTo find the value of Kc, we need to know the value of x. However, we cannot solve for x without knowing the value of Kc. Since we are not given the value of Kc, we cannot calculate the exact equilibrium concentrations or the value of Kc for this reaction at 298 K."
