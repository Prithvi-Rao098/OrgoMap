    "message_1": "Question: A student wants to quantify the amount of iron (Fe) in a water sample using coulometry. The sample has a mass of 50.0 g and contains iron in the form of Fe(II) ions. The student sets up the electrochemical cell and begins the oxidation reaction, which requires a current of 16.0 A for 1200 s. What is the concentration of Fe(II) ions in the water sample in mol/L?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first calculate the moles of electrons transferred during the oxidation reaction, then determine the moles of Fe(II) ions, and finally calculate the concentration of Fe(II) ions in the water sample.\n\n1. Calculate the charge (in coulombs) passed through the electrochemical cell:\nCharge (Q) = Current (I) × Time (t)\nQ = 16.0 A × 1200 s = 19200 C\n\n2. Calculate the moles of electrons transferred:\nMoles of electrons (n) = Charge (Q) / Faraday constant (F)\nFaraday constant (F) = 96485 C/mol\nn = 19200 C / 96485 C/mol ≈ 0.1988 mol of electrons\n\n3. Determine the moles of Fe(II) ions:\nThe balanced oxidation half-reaction for Fe(II) to Fe(III) is:\nFe(II) → Fe(III) + e^-\nSo, 1 mole of Fe(II) ions requires 1 mole of electrons for oxidation.\nMoles of Fe(II) ions = Moles of electrons = 0.1988 mol\n\n4. Calculate the concentration of Fe(II) ions in the water sample:\nFirst, convert the mass of the water sample to volume, assuming the density of water is 1 g/mL or 1 g/cm³:\nVolume = Mass / Density = 50.0 g / 1 g/mL = 50.0 mL\nNow, convert the volume from mL to L:\nVolume = 50.0 mL × (1 L / 1000 mL) = 0.050 L\n\nConcentration of Fe(II) ions = Moles of Fe(II) ions / Volume\nConcentration = 0.1988 mol / 0.050 L ≈ 3.976 mol/L\n\nThe concentration of Fe(II) ions in the water sample is approximately 3.976 mol/L."
