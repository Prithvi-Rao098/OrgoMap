    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change of oxidation for the combustion of 1 mole of ethane gas, we need to consider the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nC₂H₆(g) + 7/2 O₂(g) → 2 CO₂(g) + 3 H₂O(g)\n\nNow, we can use Hess's Law, which states that the enthalpy change for a reaction is equal to the sum of the enthalpy changes for the products minus the sum of the enthalpy changes for the reactants:\n\nΔH = Σ ΔHf(products) - Σ ΔHf(reactants)\n\nFor this reaction, we have:\n\nΔH = [2 × ΔHf(CO₂) + 3 × ΔHf(H₂O)] - [ΔHf(C₂H₆) + 7/2 × ΔHf(O₂)]\n\nSince the enthalpy of formation for an element in its standard state (such as O₂ gas) is zero, the term for oxygen gas will not contribute to the calculation:\n\nΔH = [2 × (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 3 × (-241.8 kJ/mol)] - [(-84.7 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH = (-787 kJ + -725.4 kJ) - (-84.7 kJ)\n\nΔH = (-1512.4 kJ) + 84.7 kJ\n\nΔH = -1427.7 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy change of oxidation for the combustion of 1 mole of ethane gas is -1427.7 kJ/mol."
