    "message_1": "What is the concentration of iron(II) ions in a sample of water collected from a local pond using colorimetry, if the measured absorbance of the sample at 565 nm is 0.673 and the molar absorptivity of the iron(II) complex at this wavelength is 20,500 M⁻¹·cm⁻¹?",
    "message_2": "To find the concentration of iron(II) ions in the sample, we can use the Beer-Lambert Law, which states:\n\nA = ε × c × l\n\nwhere A is the absorbance, ε is the molar absorptivity, c is the concentration of the solution (in mol/L or M), and l is the path length of the cuvette (in cm).\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nA = 0.673\nε = 20,500 M⁻¹·cm⁻¹\nl = 1 cm (assuming a standard cuvette)\n\nWe need to solve for c (the concentration of iron(II) ions):\n\n0.673 = 20,500 × c × 1\n\nNow, we can isolate c:\n\nc = 0.673 / 20,500\n\nc ≈ 0.0000328 M\n\nSo, the concentration of iron(II) ions in the sample is approximately 0.0000328 M or 32.8 µM."
