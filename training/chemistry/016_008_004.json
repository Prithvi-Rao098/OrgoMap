    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat energy required to melt the ice, we can use the formula:\n\nq = n × ΔHf\n\nwhere q is the heat energy, n is the number of moles of the substance, and ΔHf is the enthalpy of fusion.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of ice. The molar mass of water (H₂O) is 18.015 g/mol. \n\nn = mass / molar mass\nn = 25 g / 18.015 g/mol\nn ≈ 1.387 moles\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat energy required to melt the ice:\n\nq = n × ΔHf\nq = 1.387 moles × 6.01 kJ/mol\nq ≈ 8.34 kJ\n\nTherefore, the amount of heat energy required to melt 25 grams of ice at 0°C is approximately 8.34 kJ."
