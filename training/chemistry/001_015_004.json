    "message_2": "I cannot draw the structures here, but I can describe the synthetic route for the production of ibuprofen starting from benzene. The retrosynthesis involves the following steps:\n\n1. Starting from benzene, perform a Friedel-Crafts acylation using propionyl chloride and aluminum chloride as a catalyst to obtain isobutylbenzene.\n\n2. Next, perform a hydroxylation reaction using a mixture of potassium permanganate (KMnO4) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in water to oxidize the isobutyl group to form a carboxylic acid, resulting in 4-isobutylbenzoic acid.\n\n3. Convert the carboxylic acid to an acid chloride by reacting it with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) to form 4-isobutylbenzoyl chloride.\n\n4. Prepare the required amine by reacting ethyl acetoacetate with ammonia (NH3) to form the corresponding enamine, followed by hydrolysis and decarboxylation to yield 2-methylpropylamine.\n\n5. Finally, perform an amide coupling reaction between the 4-isobutylbenzoyl chloride and 2-methylpropylamine to obtain ibuprofen.\n\nThis is a simplified version of the synthetic route, and there may be other methods or optimizations possible. However, this should give you a general idea of the steps required to synthesize ibuprofen starting from benzene."
