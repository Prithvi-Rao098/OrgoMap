The specific problem is: \n\nCalculate the enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nCH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(l)\n\nGiven the following enthalpies of formation:\n\nΔHf(CH4) = -74.8 kJ/mol\n\nΔHf(CO2) = -393.5 kJ/mol\n\nΔHf(H2O) = -285.8 kJ/mol",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the following formula:\n\nΔH(reaction) = Σ ΔHf(products) - Σ ΔHf(reactants)\n\nFor this reaction, we have:\n\nΔH(reaction) = [ΔHf(CO2) + 2 * ΔHf(H2O)] - [ΔHf(CH4) + 2 * ΔHf(O2)]\n\nSince the enthalpy of formation for an element in its standard state is zero, ΔHf(O2) = 0 kJ/mol. Now we can plug in the given values:\n\nΔH(reaction) = [(-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 * (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [(-74.8 kJ/mol) + 2 * (0 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH(reaction) = (-393.5 kJ/mol - 571.6 kJ/mol) - (-74.8 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH(reaction) = (-965.1 kJ/mol) + 74.8 kJ/mol\n\nΔH(reaction) = -890.3 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the enthalpy change for the reaction is -890.3 kJ/mol."
