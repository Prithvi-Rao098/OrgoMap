    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat energy (in joules), m is the mass of the substance (in grams), c is the heat capacity (in J/goC), and ΔT is the change in temperature (in degrees Celsius).\n\nWe are given the mass (m = 50.0 g), the initial and final temperatures (25°C and 75°C), and the heat energy (q = 445 J). We need to find the heat capacity (c).\n\nFirst, let's find the change in temperature (ΔT):\n\nΔT = T_final - T_initial\nΔT = 75°C - 25°C\nΔT = 50°C\n\nNow, we can rearrange the formula to solve for the heat capacity (c):\n\nc = q / (mΔT)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nc = 445 J / (50.0 g × 50°C)\nc = 445 J / 2500 g°C\nc = 0.178 J/goC\n\nSo, the heat capacity of the aluminum is 0.178 J/goC."
