    "message_2": "To calculate the entropy change (∆S) for the reaction, we can use the formula:\n\n∆S = ∑S_products - ∑S_reactants\n\nFor the reactants, we have 2 moles of H2(g) and 1 mole of O2(g). For the products, we have 2 moles of H2O(l). We can plug in the given standard molar entropy values:\n\n∆S = [(2 moles × 70.0 J/K•mol H2O(l))] - [(2 moles × 131.3 J/K•mol H2(g)) + (1 mole × 205.0 J/K•mol O2(g))]\n\n∆S = [(140.0 J/K)] - [(262.6 J/K) + (205.0 J/K)]\n\n∆S = 140.0 J/K - 467.6 J/K\n\n∆S = -327.6 J/K\n\nThe entropy change (∆S) for the reaction is -327.6 J/K."
