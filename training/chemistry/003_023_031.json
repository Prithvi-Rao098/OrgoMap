    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of moles of methane (CH4) and then use the given energy release per mole to calculate the total heat released.\n\n1. Calculate the molar mass of methane (CH4):\nC: 12.01 g/mol\nH: 1.01 g/mol\n\nMolar mass of CH4 = 12.01 + (4 × 1.01) = 12.01 + 4.04 = 16.05 g/mol\n\n2. Determine the number of moles of methane:\nmoles = mass / molar mass\nmoles = 75.5 g / 16.05 g/mol = 4.7 moles\n\n3. Calculate the heat released:\nheat released = moles × energy release per mole\nheat released = 4.7 moles × 802 kJ/mol = 3770.4 kJ\n\nSo, 3770.4 kJ of heat is released when 75.5 grams of methane undergo complete combustion in a bomb calorimeter."
