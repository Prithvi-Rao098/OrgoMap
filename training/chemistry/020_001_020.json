    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (K) for the given reaction, we will use the expression for K:\n\nK = [HI]^2 / ([H2] * [I2])\n\nAt equilibrium, the concentrations are given as [H2] = 0.15 M, [I2] = 0.15 M, and [HI] = 0.55 M. Plugging these values into the expression for K:\n\nK = (0.55)^2 / (0.15 * 0.15)\n\nK = 0.3025 / 0.0225\n\nK ≈ 13.44\n\nThe equilibrium constant, K, for the given reaction at 25 °C is approximately 13.44."
