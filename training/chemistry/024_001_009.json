    "message_2": "1. Required volume of the CSTR:\n\nThe residence time (τ) is given as 4 hours. The volumetric flow rate (Q) is given as 10 L/hour. The volume (V) of the CSTR can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = τ * Q\n\nV = 4 hours * 10 L/hour = 40 L\n\nSo, the required volume of the CSTR is 40 liters.\n\n2. Heat generated by the reaction:\n\nTo calculate the heat generated by the reaction, we need to know the heat of reaction (ΔH) for the given reaction A + 2B -> C. Since this information is not provided, we cannot calculate the exact heat generated by the reaction. However, we can represent it as:\n\nHeat generated = moles of product C per hour * ΔH\n\nHeat generated = 5 moles/hour * ΔH\n\n3. Cooling rate required to maintain the reactor temperature below 50°C:\n\nAgain, without knowing the heat of reaction (ΔH), we cannot calculate the exact cooling rate required. However, we can represent it in terms of ΔH as:\n\nCooling rate = Heat generated\n\nCooling rate = 5 moles/hour * ΔH\n\nIn summary, the required volume of the CSTR is 40 liters, and the heat generated by the reaction and the cooling rate required to maintain the reactor temperature below 50°C are both dependent on the heat of reaction (ΔH) for the given reaction A + 2B -> C."
