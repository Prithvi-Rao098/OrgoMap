    "message_2": "To find the percent composition of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3), we first need to determine the molar mass of the compound and then find the mass contribution of each element (iron and oxygen) to the compound.\n\n1. Calculate the molar mass of Fe2O3:\n- Molar mass of Iron (Fe) = 55.845 g/mol\n- Molar mass of Oxygen (O) = 16.00 g/mol\n\nFe2O3 has 2 moles of iron and 3 moles of oxygen, so:\n- Molar mass of 2 moles of Fe = 2 * 55.845 g/mol = 111.69 g/mol\n- Molar mass of 3 moles of O = 3 * 16.00 g/mol = 48.00 g/mol\n\nTotal molar mass of Fe2O3 = 111.69 g/mol (Fe) + 48.00 g/mol (O) = 159.69 g/mol\n\n2. Calculate the mass contribution of each element:\n- Mass contribution of Iron (Fe) = 111.69 g/mol\n- Mass contribution of Oxygen (O) = 48.00 g/mol\n\n3. Calculate the percent composition of each element:\n- Percent composition of Iron (Fe) = (mass contribution of Fe / total molar mass of Fe2O3) * 100\n  = (111.69 g/mol / 159.69 g/mol) * 100 = 69.94%\n\n- Percent composition of Oxygen (O) = (mass contribution of O / total molar mass of Fe2O3) * 100\n  = (48.00 g/mol / 159.69 g/mol) * 100 = 30.06%\n\nThe percent composition of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) is approximately 69.94% Iron (Fe) and 30.06% Oxygen (O)."
