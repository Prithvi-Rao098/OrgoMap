    "message_2": "The preparation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) from toluene and nitric acid involves a nitration reaction. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nC7H8 + 3 HNO3 → C7H5N3O6 + 3 H2O\n\nToluene (C7H8) reacts with nitric acid (HNO3) to form 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (C7H5N3O6) and water (H2O).\n\nTo calculate the theoretical yield of TNT, we first need to determine the limiting reactant. In this case, we are given 50 grams of toluene and excess nitric acid, so toluene is the limiting reactant.\n\nNext, we need to find the molar mass of toluene and TNT:\n\nToluene (C7H8): (7 × 12.01) + (8 × 1.01) = 92.14 g/mol\nTNT (C7H5N3O6): (7 × 12.01) + (5 × 1.01) + (3 × 14.01) + (6 × 16.00) = 227.13 g/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the moles of toluene used in the reaction:\n\nmoles of toluene = mass of toluene / molar mass of toluene\nmoles of toluene = 50 g / 92.14 g/mol = 0.542 mol\n\nAccording to the balanced chemical equation, 1 mole of toluene reacts to produce 1 mole of TNT. Therefore, the moles of TNT produced will be the same as the moles of toluene used:\n\nmoles of TNT = 0.542 mol\n\nFinally, we can calculate the theoretical yield of TNT:\n\nmass of TNT = moles of TNT × molar mass of TNT\nmass of TNT = 0.542 mol × 227.13 g/mol = 123.04 g\n\nThe theoretical yield of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene is 123.04 grams."
