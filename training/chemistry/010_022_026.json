    "message_1": "A metal rod made of iron is coupled with a zinc rod in an aqueous medium. If the corrosion potential of the iron rod is -0.44 V and that of the zinc rod is -0.76 V, calculate the corrosion current density of the iron rod when coupled with the zinc rod at 25°C. The polarization resistance of the iron rod is 880 Ωcm².",
    "message_2": "To calculate the corrosion current density of the iron rod when coupled with the zinc rod, we can use the following equation:\n\nCorrosion current density (i_corr) = (E_corr_iron - E_corr_zinc) / R_p\n\nwhere E_corr_iron is the corrosion potential of the iron rod (-0.44 V), E_corr_zinc is the corrosion potential of the zinc rod (-0.76 V), and R_p is the polarization resistance of the iron rod (880 Ωcm²).\n\nFirst, we need to find the difference in corrosion potential between the iron and zinc rods:\n\nΔE_corr = E_corr_iron - E_corr_zinc = -0.44 V - (-0.76 V) = 0.32 V\n\nNext, we can use this value to calculate the corrosion current density:\n\ni_corr = ΔE_corr / R_p = 0.32 V / 880 Ωcm² = 3.64 × 10⁻⁴ A/cm²\n\nSo, the corrosion current density of the iron rod when coupled with the zinc rod at 25°C is 3.64 × 10⁻⁴ A/cm²."
