    "message_2": "To calculate the yield of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, we first need to determine the limiting reactant in the reaction. We will do this by comparing the moles of each reactant used.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nN2H4 + C6H3Cl(NO2)2 â†’ C6H3(NO2)2N2H3 + HCl\n\nThe molar mass of hydrazine (N2H4) is (2 * 14.01) + (4 * 1.01) = 32.05 g/mol.\nThe molar mass of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (C6H3Cl(NO2)2) is (6 * 12.01) + (3 * 1.01) + 35.45 + (2 * (14.01 + (2 * 16.00))) = 202.56 g/mol.\nThe molar mass of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (C6H3(NO2)2N2H3) is (6 * 12.01) + (3 * 1.01) + (2 * (14.01 + (2 * 16.00))) + (2 * 14.01) + (3 * 1.01) = 198.14 g/mol.\n\nNow, we will calculate the moles of each reactant:\n\nMoles of hydrazine = 5 g / 32.05 g/mol = 0.156 mol\nMoles of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene = 8 g / 202.56 g/mol = 0.0395 mol\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, we can see that 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene is the limiting reactant.\n\nNext, we will calculate the theoretical yield of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine:\n\nMoles of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine = moles of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene = 0.0395 mol\nTheoretical yield = 0.0395 mol * 198.14 g/mol = 7.83 g\n\nNow, we can calculate the percentage yield:\n\nPercentage yield = (actual yield / theoretical yield) * 100\nPercentage yield = (6 g / 7.83 g) * 100 = 76.62%\n\nThe yield of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine obtained from the reaction is 76.62%."
