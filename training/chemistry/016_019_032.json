The equilibrium pressure of hydrogen gas at this temperature is 1.5 atm and the surface area of the adsorbent is 50 cm². (Assume ideal gas behavior and that the adsorption occurs under standard conditions.)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of adsorption, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nΔH_ads = -RT * ln(P/P₀)\n\nwhere ΔH_ads is the enthalpy of adsorption, R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin (298 K), P is the equilibrium pressure (1.5 atm), and P₀ is the standard pressure (1 atm).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the pressure from atm to Pa:\n\n1 atm = 101325 Pa\n\nP = 1.5 atm * 101325 Pa/atm = 151987.5 Pa\nP₀ = 1 atm * 101325 Pa/atm = 101325 Pa\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nΔH_ads = -8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K * ln(151987.5 Pa / 101325 Pa)\nΔH_ads = -8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K * ln(1.5)\nΔH_ads ≈ -3486.9 J/mol\n\nNow, we need to find the number of moles of hydrogen gas:\n\nMolar mass of H₂ = 2 g/mol\nNumber of moles = mass / molar mass = 2.5 g / 2 g/mol = 1.25 mol\n\nFinally, we can calculate the total enthalpy of adsorption:\n\nTotal enthalpy of adsorption = ΔH_ads * number of moles\nTotal enthalpy of adsorption = -3486.9 J/mol * 1.25 mol\nTotal enthalpy of adsorption ≈ -4358.6 J\n\nSo, the enthalpy of adsorption for 2.5 grams of hydrogen gas adsorbed onto the surface is approximately -4358.6 J."
