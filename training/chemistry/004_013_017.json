    "message_1": "What is the mole amount of copper in a copper wire with a mass of 2.67 grams, using coulometry analysis? The electrolytic cell was run until 0.2716 Faradays of charge had been passed through the cell. The atomic weight of copper is 63.546 g/mol.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the Faraday's constant and the relationship between moles, charge, and Faraday's constant. Faraday's constant (F) is approximately 96,485 C/mol (coulombs per mole of electrons).\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of electrons that have been passed through the cell. We can do this by dividing the charge passed through the cell by Faraday's constant:\n\nMoles of electrons = Charge / Faraday's constant\nMoles of electrons = 0.2716 Faradays * 96,485 C/mol\nMoles of electrons = 26,200 C / 96,485 C/mol\nMoles of electrons ≈ 0.2716 mol\n\nNow, we need to find the mole ratio between copper and electrons. The balanced half-reaction for the reduction of copper ions is:\n\nCu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 2 moles of electrons are required to reduce 1 mole of copper ions. Therefore, the mole ratio between copper and electrons is 1:2.\n\nNow, we can find the moles of copper by dividing the moles of electrons by the mole ratio:\n\nMoles of copper = Moles of electrons / Mole ratio\nMoles of copper = 0.2716 mol / 2\nMoles of copper ≈ 0.1358 mol\n\nSo, there are approximately 0.1358 moles of copper in the copper wire."
