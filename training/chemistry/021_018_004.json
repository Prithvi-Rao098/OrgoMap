    "message_2": "Predicting the exact boiling point of a compound based solely on its molecular weight and the presence of London dispersion forces is not possible without more specific information about the compound's structure and properties. However, we can provide a general idea of what to expect.\n\nLondon dispersion forces are the weakest of the intermolecular forces, and they arise from temporary fluctuations in electron distribution around molecules. These forces generally increase with increasing molecular weight and surface area of the molecules.\n\nA compound with a molecular weight of 100 g/mol and only London dispersion forces as the predominant intermolecular force would likely have a relatively low boiling point compared to compounds with stronger intermolecular forces (such as hydrogen bonding or dipole-dipole interactions). This is because weaker intermolecular forces require less energy to overcome, allowing the compound to transition from the liquid to the gas phase at lower temperatures.\n\nFor comparison, consider the boiling points of some simple hydrocarbons with molecular weights near 100 g/mol:\n\n- n-Octane (C8H18, molecular weight 114 g/mol) has a boiling point of 125.7°C.\n- n-Nonane (C9H20, molecular weight 128 g/mol) has a boiling point of 150.8°C.\n\nThese compounds also rely primarily on London dispersion forces for their intermolecular interactions. While this information does not provide an exact boiling point for the compound in question, it suggests that the boiling point is likely to be in the range of 100-200°C, depending on the specific structure and properties of the compound."
