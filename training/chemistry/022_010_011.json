    "message_2": "When you mix a solution of calcium chloride (CaCl₂) with a solution of sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃), a precipitation reaction occurs. In this reaction, calcium carbonate (CaCO₃) is formed as a precipitate, and sodium chloride (NaCl) remains in the solution. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nCaCl₂ (aq) + Na₂CO₃ (aq) → CaCO₃ (s) + 2 NaCl (aq)\n\nIn this equation, (aq) denotes an aqueous solution, and (s) denotes a solid precipitate. The precipitate formed in this reaction is calcium carbonate (CaCO₃)."
