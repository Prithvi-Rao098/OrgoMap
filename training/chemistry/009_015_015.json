    "message_2": "To find the concentration of cobalt in the sample, we need to determine the number of moles of cobalt present and then divide that by the total mass of the sample.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of moles of cobalt (Co) in the sample. The atomic mass of cobalt is approximately 58.93 g/mol.\n\n1. Calculate the number of atoms in one mole of cobalt using Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol):\n\nNumber of moles of Co = (3.467 x 10^21 Co nuclei) / (6.022 x 10^23 Co nuclei/mol)\nNumber of moles of Co ≈ 0.00576 mol\n\n2. Calculate the mass of cobalt in the sample:\n\nMass of Co = (Number of moles of Co) x (Atomic mass of Co)\nMass of Co ≈ (0.00576 mol) x (58.93 g/mol)\nMass of Co ≈ 0.3399 g\n\n3. Calculate the concentration of cobalt in the sample:\n\nConcentration of Co = (Mass of Co) / (Total mass of the sample)\nConcentration of Co ≈ (0.3399 g) / (2.035 g)\nConcentration of Co ≈ 0.1669\n\n4. Convert the concentration to a percentage:\n\nConcentration of Co (%) = 0.1669 x 100%\nConcentration of Co ≈ 16.69%\n\nThe concentration of cobalt in the sample is approximately 16.69%."
