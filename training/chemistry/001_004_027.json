    "message_2": "The functional group in the molecule CH3COOH (acetic acid) responsible for its acidic properties is the carboxyl group (-COOH). The carboxyl group consists of a carbonyl group (C=O) and a hydroxyl group (O-H) bonded to the same carbon atom.\n\nThe mechanism of its reaction with a base involves the donation of a proton (H+) from the carboxyl group to the base. This process is called proton transfer or acid-base reaction. Here's a general outline of the mechanism:\n\n1. The lone pair of electrons on the base (usually a hydroxide ion, OH- or another negatively charged species) attacks the hydrogen atom of the carboxyl group in the acetic acid molecule.\n2. The O-H bond in the carboxyl group breaks, and the electrons from this bond move to the oxygen atom, forming a negatively charged acetate ion (CH3COO-).\n3. The base accepts the proton (H+) from the acetic acid, forming a water molecule (H2O) or another neutral species.\n\nAs a result, the acetic acid molecule loses a proton and becomes an acetate ion, while the base gains a proton and forms a neutral species. This proton transfer is the main reason for the acidic properties of acetic acid and other carboxylic acids."
