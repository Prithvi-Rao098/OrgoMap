    "message_2": "The balanced chemical equation for the neutralization of hydrochloric acid (HCl) with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is:\n\nHCl (aq) + NaOH (aq) → NaCl (aq) + H2O (l)\n\nTo find the concentration of the resulting sodium chloride (NaCl) solution, we can use the formula:\n\nM1V1 = M2V2\n\nwhere M1 and V1 are the molarity and volume of the first solution (HCl), and M2 and V2 are the molarity and volume of the second solution (NaOH).\n\nFirst, we need to determine the moles of HCl and NaOH:\n\nmoles of HCl = M1 × V1 = 0.1 M × 0.025 L = 0.0025 moles\nmoles of NaOH = M2 × V2 = 0.05 M × 0.05 L = 0.0025 moles\n\nSince the moles of HCl and NaOH are equal, the reaction goes to completion, and all the HCl and NaOH will react to form NaCl and water.\n\nNow, we can find the concentration of the resulting NaCl solution. The total volume of the solution is the sum of the volumes of HCl and NaOH:\n\nV_total = V1 + V2 = 0.025 L + 0.05 L = 0.075 L\n\nSince all the HCl and NaOH reacted to form NaCl, the moles of NaCl will be equal to the moles of HCl or NaOH:\n\nmoles of NaCl = 0.0025 moles\n\nNow, we can find the concentration of NaCl:\n\nM_NaCl = moles of NaCl / V_total = 0.0025 moles / 0.075 L = 0.0333 M\n\nSo, the concentration of the resulting sodium chloride solution is 0.0333 M."
