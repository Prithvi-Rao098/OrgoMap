    "message_2": "The difference between geometric and structural isomerism in organic compounds lies in the arrangement of atoms and bonds within the molecules. \n\n1. Structural isomerism (also known as constitutional isomerism) occurs when isomers have the same molecular formula but different arrangements of atoms in their structure. There are several types of structural isomers, including chain isomers, position isomers, and functional group isomers. Structural isomers typically have different physical and chemical properties due to their distinct atomic arrangements.\n\n2. Geometric isomerism (also known as cis-trans or E-Z isomerism) is a type of stereoisomerism that occurs when isomers have the same molecular formula and the same atomic arrangement but differ in the spatial orientation of certain groups around a double bond or a ring structure. Geometric isomers are characterized by restricted rotation around the double bond or within the ring, leading to different spatial arrangements of the substituent groups. Geometric isomers often have different physical and chemical properties due to their distinct spatial configurations.\n\nTo distinguish between the two types of isomers using physical and chemical properties, you can consider the following:\n\n1. Boiling and melting points: Structural isomers may have significantly different boiling and melting points due to differences in their molecular structures, while geometric isomers often have similar boiling and melting points due to their similar atomic arrangements.\n\n2. Solubility: Structural isomers with different functional groups may exhibit different solubility properties in various solvents, while geometric isomers typically have similar solubility properties due to their similar structures.\n\n3. Chemical reactivity: Structural isomers may exhibit different chemical reactivity due to the presence of different functional groups or different positions of the functional groups within the molecule. In contrast, geometric isomers often have similar reactivity patterns, although the rate of reaction may vary depending on the spatial orientation of the groups involved.\n\n4. Spectroscopy: Techniques such as infrared (IR) spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry can be used to distinguish between structural isomers based on their unique spectral signatures. Geometric isomers may also show differences in their spectra, but these differences are often more subtle and may require more advanced techniques or careful analysis to identify.\n\nBy analyzing the physical and chemical properties of the isomers, you can determine whether they are geometric or structural isomers and further classify them based on their specific type of isomerism."
