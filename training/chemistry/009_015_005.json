    "message_2": "To determine the concentration of a specific element in a given sample using neutron activation analysis (NAA), you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Irradiate the sample with neutrons in a nuclear reactor. This will cause the specific element to become radioactive and emit gamma rays.\n\n2. Analyze the gamma-ray spectrum of the irradiated sample using gamma-ray spectroscopy. Identify the characteristic peak for the specific element at a certain energy level.\n\n3. Measure the peak area (counts) of the characteristic gamma-ray peak for the specific element in the sample.\n\n4. Irradiate a standard sample with a known concentration of the specific element under the same conditions as the unknown sample. Analyze the gamma-ray spectrum of the standard sample and measure the peak area of the characteristic gamma-ray peak for the specific element.\n\n5. Calculate the concentration of the specific element in the unknown sample using the following formula:\n\nConcentration_unknown = (Peak_area_unknown / Peak_area_standard) * Concentration_standard\n\nWhere:\n- Concentration_unknown is the concentration of the specific element in the unknown sample.\n- Peak_area_unknown is the peak area of the characteristic gamma-ray peak for the specific element in the unknown sample.\n- Peak_area_standard is the peak area of the characteristic gamma-ray peak for the specific element in the standard sample.\n- Concentration_standard is the known concentration of the specific element in the standard sample.\n\nBy using this formula, you can determine the concentration of the specific element (e.g., gold, silver) in the given sample using neutron activation analysis."
