    "message_2": "To find the average energy of a gas molecule in a canonical (NVT) ensemble, we can use the equipartition theorem. The equipartition theorem states that the average energy per degree of freedom is (1/2)kT, where k is the Boltzmann constant (1.380649 × 10^(-23) J/K) and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nFor an ideal gas, there are three translational degrees of freedom (x, y, and z). Therefore, the total average energy per molecule (E) can be calculated as:\n\nE = (3/2)kT\n\nGiven the temperature T = 298 K, we can plug in the values:\n\nE = (3/2)(1.380649 × 10^(-23) J/K)(298 K)\n\nE ≈ 6.152 × 10^(-21) J\n\nSo, the average energy of a gas molecule in a canonical (NVT) ensemble at a temperature of 298 K and pressure of 1 atm is approximately 6.152 × 10^(-21) Joules."
