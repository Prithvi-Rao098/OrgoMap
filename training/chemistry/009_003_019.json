    "message_2": "To calculate the energy released in the nuclear fission reaction of Uranium-235 when it is split into Krypton-92 and Barium-141, we can use the mass-energy equivalence formula:\n\nE = Δm * c^2\n\nwhere E is the energy released, Δm is the change in mass, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3.0 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to find the change in mass (Δm) during the reaction. To do this, we need the atomic masses of the elements involved:\n\n- Uranium-235: 235.0439299 u\n- Krypton-92: 91.9261562 u\n- Barium-141: 140.914411 u\n- Neutron: 1.008664915 u (since a neutron is involved in the fission process)\n\nThe initial mass (Uranium-235 + Neutron) is:\n\n235.0439299 u + 1.008664915 u = 236.052594815 u\n\nThe final mass (Krypton-92 + Barium-141) is:\n\n91.9261562 u + 140.914411 u = 232.8405672 u\n\nNow, we can find the change in mass (Δm):\n\nΔm = initial mass - final mass\nΔm = 236.052594815 u - 232.8405672 u\nΔm = 3.212027615 u\n\nTo convert the mass difference from atomic mass units (u) to kilograms (kg), we use the conversion factor 1 u = 1.66053906660 x 10^-27 kg:\n\nΔm = 3.212027615 u * 1.66053906660 x 10^-27 kg/u\nΔm = 5.333 x 10^-27 kg\n\nNow, we can use the mass-energy equivalence formula to find the energy released:\n\nE = Δm * c^2\nE = (5.333 x 10^-27 kg) * (3.0 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nE = 5.333 x 10^-27 kg * 9.0 x 10^16 m^2/s^2\nE = 4.7997 x 10^-10 kg*m^2/s^2\n\nSince 1 Joule (J) is equal to 1 kg*m^2/s^2, the energy released is:\n\nE = 4.7997 x 10^-10 J\n\nSo, the energy released in the nuclear fission reaction of Uranium-235 when it is split into Krypton-92 and Barium-141 is approximately 4.8 x 10^-10 Joules."
