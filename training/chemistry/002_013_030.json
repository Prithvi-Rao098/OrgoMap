    "message_2": "In SF4, the central atom is sulfur (S). To determine the hybridization of the central atom, we need to first find its electron domain geometry. \n\n1. Count the valence electrons of the central atom: Sulfur has 6 valence electrons.\n2. Count the number of atoms bonded to the central atom: There are 4 fluorine (F) atoms bonded to the sulfur.\n3. Count the number of lone pairs on the central atom: Sulfur has 6 - (4x2) = 6 - 8 = -2 electrons left for lone pairs, but since it can expand its octet, it will use one of its d orbitals to accommodate the extra electrons. So, it will have 1 lone pair.\n\nNow, we have 4 atoms bonded to the central atom and 1 lone pair, which gives us a total of 5 electron domains. According to the VSEPR theory, 5 electron domains result in a trigonal bipyramidal electron domain geometry. \n\nIn a trigonal bipyramidal geometry, the hybridization of the central atom is sp3d. Therefore, the hybridization of the central atom (sulfur) in SF4 is sp3d."
