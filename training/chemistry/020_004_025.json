    "message_1": "How does the addition of a catalyst affect the equilibrium position of a chemical reaction involving the production of hydrogen gas from the reaction of zinc with hydrochloric acid? Calculate the new equilibrium constant and explain why the catalyst has this effect on the reaction.",
    "message_2": "The addition of a catalyst to a chemical reaction does not affect the equilibrium position of the reaction. A catalyst works by lowering the activation energy of the reaction, which increases the rate at which the reaction proceeds. However, it does not change the thermodynamics of the reaction, meaning that the equilibrium constant (K) remains the same.\n\nThe reaction between zinc and hydrochloric acid can be represented by the following equation:\n\nZn(s) + 2HCl(aq) → ZnCl₂(aq) + H₂(g)\n\nThe equilibrium constant (K) for this reaction can be expressed as:\n\nK = [ZnCl₂][H₂] / [Zn][HCl]²\n\nSince the addition of a catalyst does not affect the equilibrium constant, the new equilibrium constant after adding the catalyst will be the same as the original equilibrium constant.\n\nIn summary, the addition of a catalyst to the reaction of zinc with hydrochloric acid will increase the rate at which the reaction proceeds, but it will not change the equilibrium position or the equilibrium constant of the reaction. The catalyst has this effect on the reaction because it lowers the activation energy, allowing the reaction to proceed more quickly without affecting the thermodynamics of the reaction."
