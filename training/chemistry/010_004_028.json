    "message_2": "To calculate the cell potential for the given electrochemical reaction, we first need to identify the oxidation and reduction half-reactions. In this case, Cu(s) is being oxidized to Cu²⁺(aq), and Ag⁺(aq) is being reduced to Ag(s).\n\nThe given standard reduction potentials are:\n\nCu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Cu(s)        E° = +0.34 V\nAg⁺(aq) + e⁻ → Ag(s)           E° = +0.80 V\n\nSince Cu(s) is being oxidized, we need to reverse the first half-reaction and change the sign of its standard reduction potential:\n\nCu(s) → Cu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻        E° = -0.34 V\n\nNow, we can add the two half-reactions together:\n\nCu(s) → Cu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻        E° = -0.34 V\n2(Ag⁺(aq) + e⁻ → Ag(s))       E° = 2(+0.80 V)\n\nCu(s) + 2 Ag⁺(aq) → Cu²⁺(aq) + 2 Ag(s)\n\nThe overall cell potential is the sum of the standard potentials of the two half-reactions:\n\nE°(cell) = E°(oxidation) + E°(reduction)\nE°(cell) = -0.34 V + 2(+0.80 V)\nE°(cell) = -0.34 V + 1.60 V\nE°(cell) = 1.26 V\n\nSo, the cell potential for the given electrochemical reaction is 1.26 V."
