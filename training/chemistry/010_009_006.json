    "message_1": "What is the resistance of an electrochemical cell at 25°C if the cell voltage is 1.50 V and the current passing through the cell is 0.2 A? The cell consists of a lead electrode in a solution of lead sulfate and a silver electrode in a solution of silver nitrate. The concentration of lead sulfate is 0.10 M and the concentration of silver nitrate is 0.05 M. Assume that the electrodes are separated by a porous membrane with negligible resistance.",
    "message_2": "To find the resistance of the electrochemical cell, we can use Ohm's Law, which states that the voltage (V) across a resistor is equal to the current (I) passing through it multiplied by the resistance (R). Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\nV = I × R\n\nWe are given the cell voltage (V) as 1.50 V and the current (I) as 0.2 A. We can rearrange the equation to solve for the resistance (R):\n\nR = V / I\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nR = 1.50 V / 0.2 A\n\nR = 7.5 Ω\n\nThe resistance of the electrochemical cell at 25°C is 7.5 ohms."
