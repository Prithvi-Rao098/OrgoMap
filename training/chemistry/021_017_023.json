    "message_2": "Solid methane (CH4) primarily exhibits dispersion forces, also known as London dispersion forces or van der Waals forces, as the dominant type of intermolecular forces. These forces are temporary attractive forces that occur between nonpolar molecules due to the random movement of electrons, which can create temporary dipoles. Methane is a nonpolar molecule because the electronegativity difference between carbon and hydrogen is small, and the molecule has a symmetrical tetrahedral shape, which results in the equal distribution of electron density.\n\nThe dispersion forces in solid methane affect its physical properties in several ways:\n\n1. Low melting and boiling points: Dispersion forces are generally weaker than other types of intermolecular forces, such as hydrogen bonding or dipole-dipole interactions. As a result, solid methane has relatively low melting and boiling points (melting point: -182.5°C, boiling point: -161.5°C) because less energy is required to overcome these weak forces and change the state of the substance.\n\n2. Low density: The weak dispersion forces in solid methane result in a relatively open and less compact molecular arrangement, leading to a low density. This is why methane, in its gaseous state, is lighter than air.\n\n3. Poor electrical conductivity: Since methane is a nonpolar molecule with no mobile electrons or ions, it is a poor conductor of electricity in both solid and gaseous states.\n\n4. Low viscosity: In its liquid state, methane has low viscosity due to the weak intermolecular forces. The molecules can easily slide past one another, resulting in a low resistance to flow.\n\nIn summary, solid methane exhibits dispersion forces as the primary type of intermolecular forces, which significantly influence its physical properties, such as low melting and boiling points, low density, poor electrical conductivity, and low viscosity."
