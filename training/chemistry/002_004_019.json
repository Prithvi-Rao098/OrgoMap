    "message_1": "A chemistry student wants to calculate the pH of a solution formed by mixing 100 mL of 0.1 M HCl with 200 mL of 0.05 M NaOH. What is the pH of the resulting solution?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to first determine the moles of HCl and NaOH in the solution, then find the moles of the excess reactant, and finally calculate the pH of the resulting solution.\n\n1. Calculate the moles of HCl and NaOH:\nMoles of HCl = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 M × 0.100 L = 0.010 moles\nMoles of NaOH = Molarity × Volume = 0.05 M × 0.200 L = 0.010 moles\n\n2. Determine the limiting reactant and the moles of the excess reactant:\nIn this case, both HCl and NaOH have the same number of moles (0.010 moles), so they will completely react with each other, and there will be no excess reactant. The resulting solution will be a neutral salt solution.\n\n3. Calculate the pH of the resulting solution:\nSince the solution is neutral, the pH will be 7."
