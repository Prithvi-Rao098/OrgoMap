    "message_2": "To calculate the bond order and bond length of the nitrogen-nitrogen bond in the N2 molecule, we need to consider both the Lewis structure and molecular orbital theory.\n\n1. Lewis Structure:\nThe Lewis structure of N2 is a triple bond between the two nitrogen atoms, with each nitrogen atom having one lone pair of electrons. The bond order in the Lewis structure is the number of bonds between the two atoms, which is 3 in this case.\n\n2. Molecular Orbital Theory:\nAccording to molecular orbital theory, atomic orbitals of the two nitrogen atoms combine to form molecular orbitals. Nitrogen has 5 valence electrons, so there are a total of 10 electrons in the N2 molecule. The molecular orbitals are filled in the following order: σ1s, σ*1s, σ2s, σ*2s, π2p, π*2p, and σ2p.\n\nThe molecular orbital configuration for N2 is:\nσ1s^2, σ*1s^2, σ2s^2, σ*2s^2, π2p^4, σ2p^2\n\nNow, we can calculate the bond order using the molecular orbital theory:\nBond order = (number of electrons in bonding orbitals - number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\n\nBond order = (2 + 2 + 4 + 2 - (2 + 2)) / 2\nBond order = (10 - 4) / 2\nBond order = 6 / 2\nBond order = 3\n\nThe bond order calculated using molecular orbital theory is also 3, which matches the Lewis structure.\n\nTo determine the bond length, we can refer to experimental data. The bond length of the nitrogen-nitrogen triple bond in N2 is approximately 1.10 Å (angstroms).\n\nIn conclusion, the bond order of the nitrogen-nitrogen bond in the N2 molecule is 3, and the bond length is approximately 1.10 Å."
