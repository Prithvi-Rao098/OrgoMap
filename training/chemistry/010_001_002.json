    "message_2": "To calculate the standard electrode potential of the copper electrode, we can use the Nernst equation:\n\nE = E° - (RT/nF) * lnQ\n\nWhere:\nE = electrode potential\nE° = standard electrode potential (for Cu2+/Cu, E° = +0.34 V)\nR = gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\nT = temperature in Kelvin (25°C = 298 K)\nn = number of electrons transferred (for Cu2+/Cu, n = 2)\nF = Faraday's constant (96485 C/mol)\nQ = reaction quotient, which is the ratio of the concentrations of the products to the reactants raised to their stoichiometric coefficients\n\nSince the Cu2+ ion concentration is 1.0 M, and the reaction quotient (Q) for this half-cell reaction is [Cu2+], we can plug in the values:\n\nE = 0.34 V - (8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K) / (2 * 96485 C/mol) * ln(1.0)\n\nE = 0.34 V - (0.000043 J/C) * 0\n\nE = 0.34 V\n\nThe standard electrode potential of the copper electrode under these conditions is 0.34 V."
