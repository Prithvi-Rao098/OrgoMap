    "message_2": "The preparation of 2,4-dinitrophenol from phenol and nitric acid using sulfuric acid as a catalyst involves the nitration of phenol. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nC6H5OH (phenol) + 2 HNO3 (nitric acid) â†’ C6H3(NO2)2OH (2,4-dinitrophenol) + 2 H2O (water)\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of phenol reacts with 2 moles of nitric acid to produce 1 mole of 2,4-dinitrophenol. Therefore, the correct molar ratio of phenol to nitric acid for this reaction is 1:2."
