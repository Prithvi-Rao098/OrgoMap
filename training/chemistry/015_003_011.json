    "message_2": "To calculate the fundamental vibrational frequency and corresponding infrared spectrum of the water molecule (H2O) in its ground state, we need to consider the vibrational modes of the molecule. Water has three normal modes of vibration: symmetric stretch, asymmetric stretch, and bending.\n\nThe vibrational frequencies of these modes can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nv = (1/2π) * √(k/μ)\n\nwhere v is the vibrational frequency, k is the force constant, and μ is the reduced mass of the molecule.\n\nFor water, the force constants and reduced masses for the three vibrational modes are:\n\n1. Symmetric stretch:\nForce constant (k1) = 4.95 x 10^2 N/m\nReduced mass (μ1) = 1.63 x 10^-26 kg\n\n2. Asymmetric stretch:\nForce constant (k2) = 2.00 x 10^3 N/m\nReduced mass (μ2) = 1.63 x 10^-26 kg\n\n3. Bending:\nForce constant (k3) = 7.53 x 10^1 N/m\nReduced mass (μ3) = 9.17 x 10^-27 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the vibrational frequencies for each mode:\n\n1. Symmetric stretch:\nv1 = (1/2π) * √(k1/μ1) = (1/2π) * √(4.95 x 10^2 N/m / 1.63 x 10^-26 kg) ≈ 3.65 x 10^13 Hz\n\n2. Asymmetric stretch:\nv2 = (1/2π) * √(k2/μ2) = (1/2π) * √(2.00 x 10^3 N/m / 1.63 x 10^-26 kg) ≈ 7.76 x 10^13 Hz\n\n3. Bending:\nv3 = (1/2π) * √(k3/μ3) = (1/2π) * √(7.53 x 10^1 N/m / 9.17 x 10^-27 kg) ≈ 1.60 x 10^13 Hz\n\nThe corresponding infrared spectrum can be obtained by converting these frequencies to wavenumbers (cm^-1):\n\n1. Symmetric stretch:\nν1 = v1 / c = (3.65 x 10^13 Hz) / (3.00 x 10^10 cm/s) ≈ 3650 cm^-1\n\n2. Asymmetric stretch:\nν2 = v2 / c = (7.76 x 10^13 Hz) / (3.00 x 10^10 cm/s) ≈ 7760 cm^-1\n\n3. Bending:\nν3 = v3 / c = (1.60 x 10^13 Hz) / (3.00 x 10^10 cm/s) ≈ 1600 cm^-1\n\nSo, the fundamental vibrational frequencies and corresponding infrared spectrum of the water molecule (H2O) in its ground state are:\n\n1. Symmetric stretch: 3.65 x 10^13 Hz (3650 cm^-1)\n2. Asymmetric stretch: 7.76 x 10^13 Hz (7760 cm^-1)\n3. Bending: 1.60 x 10^13 Hz (1600 cm^-1)"
