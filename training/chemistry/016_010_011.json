    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of solution of sodium chloride (NaCl), we need to know the heat of solution (ΔHsol) for NaCl. The heat of solution is the amount of heat absorbed or released when a solute dissolves in a solvent. Unfortunately, the information provided does not include the heat of solution for NaCl. \n\nHowever, if we assume that the heat of solution for NaCl is given, we can calculate the enthalpy change for dissolving 10 grams of NaCl in 100 mL of water using the following formula:\n\nΔH = (mass of NaCl) × (ΔHsol per mole of NaCl) / (molar mass of NaCl)\n\nFirst, we need to find the molar mass of NaCl:\nNa = 22.99 g/mol\nCl = 35.45 g/mol\nMolar mass of NaCl = 22.99 + 35.45 = 58.44 g/mol\n\nNow, let's assume the heat of solution for NaCl is given as X J/mol. We can now calculate the enthalpy change for dissolving 10 grams of NaCl:\n\nΔH = (10 g) × (X J/mol) / (58.44 g/mol)\n\nΔH = (10X) / 58.44 J\n\nWithout the heat of solution value (X), we cannot provide a numerical answer for the enthalpy of solution of sodium chloride in this case."
