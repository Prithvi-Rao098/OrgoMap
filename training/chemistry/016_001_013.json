    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy of formation of methane (CH₄), we can use the following balanced chemical equation:\n\nC (graphite) + 2H₂ (g) → CH₄ (g)\n\nWe can use Hess's Law, which states that the enthalpy change of a reaction is the same whether it occurs in one step or several steps. We can use the given standard enthalpies of formation for CO₂ and H₂O to find the enthalpy change for the reaction above.\n\nFirst, we need to find the enthalpy change for the formation of CO₂ and H₂O from CH₄:\n\nCH₄ (g) + 2O₂ (g) → CO₂ (g) + 2H₂O (l)  (1)\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for this reaction (ΔH₁) can be calculated using the standard enthalpies of formation of CO₂ and H₂O:\n\nΔH₁ = [1 * (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 * (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [0] = -965.1 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we need to find the enthalpy change for the formation of C (graphite) and H₂ from CO₂ and H₂O:\n\nCO₂ (g) + 2H₂O (l) → C (graphite) + 2H₂ (g) + 2O₂ (g)  (2)\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for this reaction (ΔH₂) is the negative of the enthalpy change for reaction (1):\n\nΔH₂ = -ΔH₁ = 965.1 kJ/mol\n\nFinally, we can use Hess's Law to find the standard enthalpy of formation of CH₄:\n\nC (graphite) + 2H₂ (g) → CH₄ (g)  (3)\n\nΔH₃ = ΔH₂ = 965.1 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy of formation of methane (CH₄) gas is 965.1 kJ/mol."
