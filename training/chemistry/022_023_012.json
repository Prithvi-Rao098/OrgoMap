    "message_2": "To find the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid, we can use the formula for the ionization constant (Ka) of a weak acid:\n\nKa = [H+][A-]/[HA]\n\nWhere [H+] is the concentration of hydrogen ions, [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base, and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid.\n\nIn this case, the initial concentration of acetic acid (HA) is 0.1 M, and the Ka is given as 1.8 x 10^-5. Since the acetic acid is only partially ionized, we can assume that the change in concentration of [H+] and [A-] is equal to x, and the change in concentration of [HA] is -x.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 = (x)(x)/(0.1 - x)\n\nSince x is very small compared to 0.1, we can approximate the equation as:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 ≈ x^2/0.1\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx^2 = 1.8 x 10^-5 * 0.1\nx^2 = 1.8 x 10^-6\nx ≈ 1.34 x 10^-3\n\nNow that we have the concentration of hydrogen ions [H+], we can find the pH using the formula:\n\npH = -log[H+]\n\npH = -log(1.34 x 10^-3)\npH ≈ 2.87\n\nSo, the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid is approximately 2.87."
