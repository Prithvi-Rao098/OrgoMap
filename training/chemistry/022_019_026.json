    "message_2": "Given the rate law for a first-order reaction: Rate = k[A], where Rate is the rate of the reaction, k is the rate constant, and [A] is the concentration of reactant A.\n\nWe are given the rate of the reaction (Rate) as 0.05 M/s and the initial concentration of reactant A ([A]) as 0.1 M. We need to find the rate constant (k).\n\nPlugging the given values into the rate law equation:\n\n0.05 M/s = k(0.1 M)\n\nTo solve for k, divide both sides of the equation by 0.1 M:\n\nk = (0.05 M/s) / (0.1 M)\n\nk = 0.5 s^(-1)\n\nThe rate constant (k) for the decomposition of reactant A is 0.5 s^(-1)."
