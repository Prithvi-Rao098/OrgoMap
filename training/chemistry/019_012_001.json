    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the dissolution of sodium chloride in water, we need to know the heat of solution for NaCl. The heat of solution (ΔHsol) for NaCl is approximately -3.88 kJ/mol.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the number of moles of NaCl in 5.00 g:\n\nmoles = mass / molar mass\nmoles = 5.00 g / 58.44 g/mol\nmoles = 0.0856 mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the dissolution of 5.00 g of NaCl:\n\nΔH = moles × ΔHsol\nΔH = 0.0856 mol × -3.88 kJ/mol\nΔH = -0.332 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the dissolution of 5.00 g of sodium chloride in 100 mL of water at 25°C is approximately -0.332 kJ."
