    "message_2": "The decomposition reaction of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) is a thermal decomposition process that occurs when it is heated. The reaction can be represented by the following chemical equation:\n\nCaCO3 (s) â†’ CaO (s) + CO2 (g)\n\nUpon decomposition, calcium carbonate forms two products: calcium oxide (CaO), which is a solid, and carbon dioxide (CO2), which is a gas."
