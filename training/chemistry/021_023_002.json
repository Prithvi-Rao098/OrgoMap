    "message_2": "To determine whether a molecule has geometric isomers or not, you need to examine its structure and look for specific features that allow for geometric isomerism. Geometric isomerism, also known as cis-trans or E-Z isomerism, occurs in covalent compounds when there is restricted rotation around a bond, leading to different spatial arrangements of the substituent groups.\n\nHere are the factors that contribute to the presence of geometric isomerism in covalent compounds:\n\n1. Presence of a double bond or a cyclic structure: Geometric isomerism occurs when there is restricted rotation around a bond, which is commonly found in compounds with carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) or in cyclic structures. In these cases, the atoms or groups attached to the carbons cannot freely rotate around the bond, leading to different spatial arrangements.\n\n2. Different substituent groups: For geometric isomerism to occur, the carbon atoms involved in the double bond or the cyclic structure must have different substituent groups attached to them. If both carbons have identical groups, there will be no geometric isomers.\n\nFor example, consider the molecule but-2-ene (CH3-CH=CH-CH3). The central carbon-carbon double bond restricts rotation, and each carbon has two different substituent groups (one hydrogen and one alkyl group). This molecule exhibits geometric isomerism, with two possible isomers: cis-but-2-ene (where the two methyl groups are on the same side of the double bond) and trans-but-2-ene (where the two methyl groups are on opposite sides of the double bond).\n\nTo determine if a molecule has geometric isomers, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify any carbon-carbon double bonds or cyclic structures in the molecule.\n2. Check if the carbons involved in the double bond or cyclic structure have different substituent groups.\n3. If both conditions are met, the molecule has geometric isomers.\n\nKeep in mind that geometric isomerism can also occur in compounds containing other types of restricted rotation bonds, such as metal coordination complexes, but the principles outlined above still apply."
