    "message_2": "To determine the activation energy (Ea) for the electrochemical reaction between copper and nitric acid, we can use the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk = A * exp(-Ea / (R * T))\n\nwhere k is the rate constant, A is the pre-exponential factor, Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant (8.314 J mol^-1 K^-1), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nWe have two sets of data: k1 = 2.31 x 10^-6 mol L^-1 s^-1 at T1 = 25°C (298 K) and k2 = 3.81 x 10^-5 mol L^-1 s^-1 at T2 = 45°C (318 K). We can set up two equations using the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk1 = A * exp(-Ea / (R * T1))\nk2 = A * exp(-Ea / (R * T2))\n\nNow, we can divide the first equation by the second equation to eliminate the pre-exponential factor (A):\n\nk1 / k2 = exp(-Ea / (R * T1)) / exp(-Ea / (R * T2))\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\nk1 / k2 = exp((Ea / (R * T2)) - (Ea / (R * T1)))\n\nNow, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(k1 / k2) = (Ea / (R * T2)) - (Ea / (R * T1))\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for Ea:\n\nEa = R * (T1 * T2) * ln(k1 / k2) / (T2 - T1)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nEa = 8.314 J mol^-1 K^-1 * (298 K * 318 K) * ln((2.31 x 10^-6) / (3.81 x 10^-5)) / (318 K - 298 K)\n\nEa ≈ 8.314 * 94524 * (-2.72) / 20\n\nEa ≈ -214,799 J mol^-1\n\nSince the activation energy cannot be negative, there must be an error in the calculation. Let's check the equation again:\n\nln(k2 / k1) = (Ea / (R * T1)) - (Ea / (R * T2))\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for Ea:\n\nEa = R * (T1 * T2) * ln(k2 / k1) / (T1 - T2)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nEa = 8.314 J mol^-1 K^-1 * (298 K * 318 K) * ln((3.81 x 10^-5) / (2.31 x 10^-6)) / (298 K - 318 K)\n\nEa ≈ 8.314 * 94524 * 2.72 / -20\n\nEa ≈ 107,399 J mol^-1\n\nSo, the activation energy for the electrochemical reaction between copper and nitric acid is approximately 107,399 J mol^-1 or 107.4 kJ mol^-1."
