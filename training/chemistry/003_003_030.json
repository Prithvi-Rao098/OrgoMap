Additionally, if the rate constant for this reaction is 0.02 L/mol.s, what is the rate of reaction when NO concentration is 0.1 M and H2 concentration is 0.2 M?",
    "message_2": "The rate law for an elementary reaction is given by:\n\nRate = k [A]^m [B]^n\n\nwhere k is the rate constant, [A] and [B] are the concentrations of the reactants, and m and n are the orders of the reaction with respect to the reactants.\n\nFor the given reaction, 2NO + H2 → N2O + H2O, the reaction is second order with respect to NO and first order with respect to H2. Therefore, the rate law can be written as:\n\nRate = k [NO]^2 [H2]^1\n\nThe rate constant (k) is given as 0.02 L/mol.s. We are also given the concentrations of NO and H2 as 0.1 M and 0.2 M, respectively. Now we can calculate the rate of the reaction:\n\nRate = (0.02 L/mol.s) × (0.1 M)^2 × (0.2 M)\nRate = (0.02 L/mol.s) × (0.01 M^2) × (0.2 M)\nRate = (0.02 L/mol.s) × (0.002 M^3)\nRate = 0.00004 M^2.L/mol.s\n\nSo, the rate of the reaction is 0.00004 M^2.L/mol.s."
