    "message_1": "A chemistry student wants to determine the boiling point of a solution of 25 g of glucose in 500 mL of water. Calculate the boiling point of the solution if the boiling point constant of water is 0.512 °C/m and assume an ideal solution.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the boiling point of the solution, we need to first determine the molality of the glucose solution. Molality (m) is defined as the moles of solute (glucose) per kilogram of solvent (water).\n\n1. Calculate the moles of glucose (C6H12O6):\nMolar mass of glucose = (6 × 12.01) + (12 × 1.01) + (6 × 16.00) = 72.06 + 12.12 + 96.00 = 180.18 g/mol\nMoles of glucose = mass of glucose / molar mass of glucose = 25 g / 180.18 g/mol ≈ 0.1387 mol\n\n2. Convert the volume of water to mass:\nAssuming the density of water is 1 g/mL, the mass of 500 mL of water is 500 g.\n\n3. Calculate the molality of the glucose solution:\nMolality (m) = moles of glucose / mass of water (in kg) = 0.1387 mol / 0.5 kg = 0.2774 mol/kg\n\n4. Calculate the boiling point elevation using the boiling point constant of water (Kb):\nΔTb = Kb × molality = 0.512 °C/m × 0.2774 mol/kg ≈ 0.1420 °C\n\n5. Determine the boiling point of the glucose solution:\nThe normal boiling point of water is 100 °C. The boiling point of the glucose solution is the normal boiling point of water plus the boiling point elevation.\n\nBoiling point of glucose solution = 100 °C + 0.1420 °C ≈ 100.142 °C\n\nThe boiling point of the glucose solution is approximately 100.142 °C."
