    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the dissolution reaction of NaOH, we first need to determine the number of moles of NaOH and then use the heat absorbed by the solution to find the enthalpy change per mole of NaOH.\n\n1. Calculate the number of moles of NaOH:\nmoles of NaOH = mass of NaOH / molar mass of NaOH\nmoles of NaOH = 10.0 g / 40.00 g/mol = 0.25 mol\n\n2. Convert the heat absorbed by the solution from kJ to J:\n9.14 kJ = 9.14 * 1000 J = 9140 J\n\n3. Calculate the standard enthalpy change per mole of NaOH:\nΔH = heat absorbed by the solution / moles of NaOH\nΔH = 9140 J / 0.25 mol = 36560 J/mol\n\n4. Convert the enthalpy change from J/mol to kJ/mol:\nΔH = 36560 J/mol * (1 kJ / 1000 J) = 36.56 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the dissolution reaction of NaOH is 36.56 kJ/mol."
