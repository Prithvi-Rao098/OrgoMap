    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 2 moles of sucrose, we can use the following formula:\n\nΔH = moles × energy released per mole\n\nGiven that the hydrolysis of 1 mole of sucrose releases 5184 kJ/mol of energy, we can plug in the values:\n\nΔH = 2 moles × 5184 kJ/mol\n\nΔH = 10368 kJ\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 2 moles of sucrose is 10368 kJ."
