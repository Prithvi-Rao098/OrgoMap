    "message_2": "In computational chemistry, various methods can be used to calculate excited states and determine the electronic transitions involved in chemical reactions. Some of the most common methods include:\n\n1. Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT): TD-DFT is an extension of the ground-state DFT that allows the calculation of excited states by solving the time-dependent Kohn-Sham equations. It is widely used due to its relatively low computational cost and reasonable accuracy for many systems.\n\n2. Configuration Interaction (CI): CI is a wavefunction-based method that constructs excited states by considering all possible excitations from a reference wavefunction (usually the Hartree-Fock wavefunction). The accuracy of CI calculations depends on the level of excitations included, with higher levels providing more accurate results at the expense of increased computational cost.\n\n3. Coupled Cluster (CC): CC is another wavefunction-based method that uses an exponential ansatz to describe the excited states. It is known for its high accuracy, especially at the CCSD(T) level, but can be computationally expensive for large systems.\n\n4. Equation of Motion Coupled Cluster (EOM-CC): EOM-CC is an extension of the CC method specifically designed for excited states. It solves a set of linear equations to obtain the excited state energies and wavefunctions.\n\n5. Multi-Reference Methods: These methods, such as Complete Active Space Self-Consistent Field (CASSCF) and Multi-Reference Configuration Interaction (MRCI), are designed to treat systems with significant multi-reference character, where a single reference wavefunction is insufficient to describe the excited states accurately.\n\nThese methods can be used to determine the electronic transitions involved in chemical reactions by calculating the energies and properties of the excited states, such as transition dipole moments and oscillator strengths. By analyzing these properties, one can identify the most probable electronic transitions and their corresponding wavelengths or energies.\n\nAn example of a chemical reaction where these methods have been successfully applied to study the excited states involved is the photoisomerization of azobenzene. Azobenzene is a molecule that undergoes a conformational change upon absorption of light, switching between its trans and cis isomers. Computational studies using methods like TD-DFT, CASSCF, and MRCI have provided insights into the excited-state potential energy surfaces, the nature of the electronic transitions, and the mechanism of the photoisomerization process."
