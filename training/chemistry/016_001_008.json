    "message_2": "The standard enthalpy of formation, ΔH°f, of carbon dioxide (CO2) gas can be determined using the given thermochemical equations. The first equation already represents the formation of CO2 from its elements in their standard states:\n\nC(s) + O2(g) → CO2(g)    ΔH°rxn = -393.5 kJ/mol\n\nIn this case, ΔH°rxn is equal to the standard enthalpy of formation, ΔH°f, of CO2. Therefore, the standard enthalpy of formation of carbon dioxide (CO2) gas is:\n\nΔH°f (CO2) = -393.5 kJ/mol"
