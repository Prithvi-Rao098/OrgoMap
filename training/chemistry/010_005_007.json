    "message_1": "Calculate the equilibrium constant (K) for the reaction that occurs when a nickel electrode is placed in a solution containing 1.0 M of nickel ions and 1.0 M of copper ions. The nickel electrode was placed in the solution, and the cell potential was measured to be 0.21 V at 25 °C.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant (K) for the reaction, we can use the Nernst equation:\n\nE = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\n\nWhere:\nE = cell potential (0.21 V)\nE° = standard cell potential\nR = gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\nT = temperature (25 °C = 298 K)\nn = number of electrons transferred\nF = Faraday's constant (96,485 C/mol)\nQ = reaction quotient\n\nFirst, we need to determine the balanced redox reaction. The half-reactions for nickel and copper are:\n\nNi²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Ni (reduction)\nCu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu (reduction)\n\nSince we are given that the nickel electrode is placed in a solution containing both nickel and copper ions, the nickel will be oxidized, and the copper will be reduced. The balanced redox reaction is:\n\nNi + Cu²⁺ → Ni²⁺ + Cu\n\nNow, we need to find the standard cell potential (E°). The standard reduction potentials for the half-reactions are:\n\nNi²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Ni, E° = -0.25 V\nCu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu, E° = +0.34 V\n\nSince nickel is being oxidized, we need to reverse the sign of its standard reduction potential:\n\nNi → Ni²⁺ + 2e⁻, E° = +0.25 V\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard cell potential (E°) for the overall reaction:\n\nE° = E°(reduction) - E°(oxidation) = 0.34 V - 0.25 V = 0.09 V\n\nNext, we need to find the reaction quotient (Q). For the reaction:\n\nNi + Cu²⁺ → Ni²⁺ + Cu\n\nQ = [Ni²⁺]/[Cu²⁺] = 1.0/1.0 = 1\n\nNow, we can use the Nernst equation to solve for the equilibrium constant (K):\n\n0.21 V = 0.09 V - (8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K / (2 * 96,485 C/mol)) * ln(K)\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for K:\n\nln(K) = (0.21 V - 0.09 V) * (2 * 96,485 C/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K)\nln(K) = 0.12 V * (192,970 C/mol) / (2,471 J/mol·K)\nln(K) = 9.37\n\nNow, take the exponent of both sides to solve for K:\n\nK = e^9.37 ≈ 1.17 × 10^4\n\nThe equilibrium constant (K) for the reaction is approximately 1.17 × 10^4."
