    "message_2": "To find the heat of formation of methane (CH4), we can use the following balanced chemical equation:\n\nCH4 (g) + 2 O2 (g) → CO2 (g) + 2 H2O (l)\n\nThe heat of formation of methane can be calculated using Hess's Law, which states that the total enthalpy change for a reaction is the same, regardless of the pathway taken. In this case, we can use the known standard enthalpy of formation values for CO2 and H2O to find the heat of formation for CH4.\n\nΔH°(reaction) = Σ ΔH°f(products) - Σ ΔH°f(reactants)\n\nIn this reaction, the products are CO2 and 2 H2O, and the reactant is CH4. The standard enthalpy of formation of O2 is zero because it is in its elemental form. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\nΔH°(reaction) = [ΔH°f(CO2) + 2 * ΔH°f(H2O)] - ΔH°f(CH4)\n\nWe are given the standard enthalpy of formation values for CO2 and H2O:\n\nΔH°f(CO2) = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔH°f(H2O) = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔH°(reaction) = [(-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 * (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - ΔH°f(CH4)\n\nThe heat of formation of methane can be found by rearranging the equation:\n\nΔH°f(CH4) = [(-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 * (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - ΔH°(reaction)\n\nHowever, we do not have the value for ΔH°(reaction). To find this value, we need to know the heat of combustion of methane, which is the enthalpy change when one mole of methane is burned completely in oxygen. The heat of combustion of methane is -890.4 kJ/mol.\n\nSince the balanced chemical equation represents the combustion of methane, the heat of combustion is equal to the negative of the heat of reaction:\n\nΔH°(reaction) = -ΔH°c(CH4) = -(-890.4 kJ/mol) = 890.4 kJ/mol\n\nNow we can find the heat of formation of methane:\n\nΔH°f(CH4) = [(-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 * (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - 890.4 kJ/mol\nΔH°f(CH4) = (-393.5 kJ/mol - 571.6 kJ/mol) - 890.4 kJ/mol\nΔH°f(CH4) = -965.1 kJ/mol - 890.4 kJ/mol\nΔH°f(CH4) = -74.7 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the heat of formation of methane (CH4) is -74.7 kJ/mol."
