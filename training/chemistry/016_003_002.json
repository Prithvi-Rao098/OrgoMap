    "message_2": "To calculate the bond dissociation energy, we can use the enthalpies of formation for the reactants and products in the equation:\n\nΔH_reaction = Σ ΔH_f (products) - Σ ΔH_f (reactants)\n\nIn this case, the reaction is:\n\nCO(g) → C(g) + O(g)\n\nThe enthalpies of formation for CO(g), C(g), and O(g) are -110.5 kJ/mol, 716.7 kJ/mol, and 249.2 kJ/mol, respectively.\n\nΔH_reaction = [(716.7 kJ/mol) + (249.2 kJ/mol)] - [(-110.5 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH_reaction = (965.9 kJ/mol) + (110.5 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH_reaction = 1076.4 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the bond dissociation energy required to break the carbon-oxygen bond in carbon monoxide (CO) is 1076.4 kJ/mol."
