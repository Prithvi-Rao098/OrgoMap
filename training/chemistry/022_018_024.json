    "message_2": "To calculate the bond energy for the O-H bond in a water molecule, we need to consider the balanced chemical equation for the combustion of water:\n\nH2 + 1/2 O2 → H2O\n\nThe enthalpy change for this reaction is -286 kJ/mol. This means that 286 kJ of energy is released when 1 mole of water is formed from its elements. We also know that the O=O bond energy is 498 kJ/mol.\n\nIn this reaction, one O=O bond is broken and two O-H bonds are formed. We can represent the enthalpy change for the reaction as:\n\nΔH = Energy of bonds broken - Energy of bonds formed\n\n-286 kJ/mol = (1/2 × 498 kJ/mol) - (2 × O-H bond energy)\n\nNow, we can solve for the O-H bond energy:\n\n-286 kJ/mol + 2 × O-H bond energy = 1/2 × 498 kJ/mol\n\n2 × O-H bond energy = 498 kJ/mol / 2 + 286 kJ/mol\n\n2 × O-H bond energy = 249 kJ/mol + 286 kJ/mol\n\n2 × O-H bond energy = 535 kJ/mol\n\nO-H bond energy = 535 kJ/mol / 2\n\nO-H bond energy = 267.5 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the bond energy for the O-H bond in a water molecule is approximately 267.5 kJ/mol."
