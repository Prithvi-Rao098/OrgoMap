    "message_2": "The molecule with the chemical formula CH3COOH is known as acetic acid. Based on its chemical structure and relevant chemical principles, we can predict that it will be acidic.\n\nJustification:\n\n1. Presence of a carboxylic acid functional group: The chemical structure of acetic acid contains a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). Carboxylic acids are known to be acidic due to the presence of this functional group.\n\n2. Proton (H+) donor: Acidity is determined by the ability of a molecule to donate a proton (H+). In the case of acetic acid, the hydrogen atom in the -COOH group can be donated as a proton, making the molecule acidic.\n\n3. Resonance stabilization: After donating the proton, the remaining acetate ion (CH3COO-) is stabilized by resonance. The negative charge can be delocalized between the two oxygen atoms, making the ion more stable and favoring the release of the proton, which contributes to the acidity of the molecule.\n\n4. Comparison with water: Acetic acid is a weak acid, meaning it does not completely dissociate in water. However, it is still more acidic than water (which has a neutral pH of 7) because it can donate a proton more readily than water can.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the chemical structure and relevant chemical principles, the molecule CH3COOH (acetic acid) is predicted to be acidic."
