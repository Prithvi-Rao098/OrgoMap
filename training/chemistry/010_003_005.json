    "message_1": "What is the Gibbs free energy change for the electrochemical reaction:\nZn(s) + Cu2+(aq) → Zn2+(aq) + Cu(s)\ngiven that the standard reduction potentials are E°(Cu2+|Cu) = +0.34 V and E°(Zn2+|Zn) = -0.76 V, and the reaction is carried out at 25°C?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) for the electrochemical reaction, we first need to determine the standard cell potential (E°cell) for the reaction. This can be done using the standard reduction potentials given:\n\nE°cell = E°(cathode) - E°(anode)\n\nIn this reaction, Cu2+ is reduced to Cu, so it is the cathode, and Zn is oxidized to Zn2+, so it is the anode.\n\nE°cell = E°(Cu2+|Cu) - E°(Zn2+|Zn) = (+0.34 V) - (-0.76 V) = +1.10 V\n\nNow that we have the standard cell potential, we can calculate the Gibbs free energy change using the following equation:\n\nΔG° = -nFE°cell\n\nWhere n is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the reaction (in this case, 2 moles of electrons, as both Cu2+ and Zn2+ have a charge of +2), F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol), and E°cell is the standard cell potential.\n\nΔG° = -2 mol × 96,485 C/mol × 1.10 V = -212,667 J/mol\n\nSince the value is usually expressed in kJ/mol, we can convert it:\n\nΔG° = -212,667 J/mol × (1 kJ/1000 J) = -212.67 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the Gibbs free energy change for the given electrochemical reaction at 25°C is -212.67 kJ/mol."
