    "message_2": "To determine the concentration of copper (II) ions in a sample of tap water using voltammetric analysis, you will need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Collect a sample of tap water.\n\n2. Prepare the sample for analysis by filtering it to remove any particulate matter and adjusting the pH if necessary.\n\n3. Set up the voltammetric analysis equipment, which typically includes a working electrode, a reference electrode, and a counter electrode. The working electrode is often made of glassy carbon, while the reference electrode is usually a silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) electrode.\n\n4. Perform the voltammetric analysis by applying a potential to the working electrode and measuring the resulting current. The potential is typically swept from a negative value to a positive value, and the current is measured as a function of the applied potential. The resulting plot of current versus potential is called a voltammogram.\n\n5. Identify the peak in the voltammogram corresponding to the reduction of copper (II) ions to copper (I) ions or copper metal. This peak will typically occur at a characteristic potential for copper (II) ions.\n\n6. Calibrate the voltammetric analysis by analyzing a series of standard solutions containing known concentrations of copper (II) ions. Measure the peak current for each standard solution and plot the peak current as a function of the copper (II) ion concentration. This calibration curve will allow you to determine the concentration of copper (II) ions in your tap water sample.\n\n7. Measure the peak current for your tap water sample and use the calibration curve to determine the concentration of copper (II) ions in the sample.\n\nPlease note that the actual concentration of copper (II) ions in your tap water sample will depend on various factors, such as the water source and the presence of other ions in the water. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a specific concentration value without performing the voltammetric analysis."
