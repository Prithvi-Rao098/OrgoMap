The heat capacities of the reactants and products are as follows: \n\nC3H8(g): cp = 44.10 J/K \nO2(g): cp = 29.38 J/K \nCO2(g): cp = 36.8 J/K \nH2O(g): cp = 33.6 J/K \n\nAssume that the heat capacities of the products and reactants are constant over the temperature range of the reaction and that the heat lost to the surroundings is negligible.",
    "message_2": "First, let's write the balanced combustion reaction for propane:\n\nC3H8(g) + 5O2(g) -> 3CO2(g) + 4H2O(g)\n\nNow, we need to determine the moles of propane burned:\n\nMoles of propane = mass / molar mass\nMoles of propane = 12.5 g / (3 * 12.01 g/mol + 8 * 1.01 g/mol) = 12.5 g / 44.09 g/mol = 0.2834 mol\n\nNext, we will calculate the moles of products formed:\n\nMoles of CO2 = 3 * moles of propane = 3 * 0.2834 mol = 0.8502 mol\nMoles of H2O = 4 * moles of propane = 4 * 0.2834 mol = 1.1336 mol\n\nNow, we will calculate the heat change for cooling the products from 700°C to 25°C:\n\nΔH_CO2 = moles of CO2 * cp_CO2 * ΔT = 0.8502 mol * 36.8 J/mol*K * (25 - 700) = -0.8502 * 36.8 * -675 = 21256.9 J\nΔH_H2O = moles of H2O * cp_H2O * ΔT = 1.1336 mol * 33.6 J/mol*K * (25 - 700) = -1.1336 * 33.6 * -675 = 25687.2 J\n\nThe total heat change for cooling the products is the sum of the heat changes for CO2 and H2O:\n\nΔH_total = ΔH_CO2 + ΔH_H2O = 21256.9 J + 25687.2 J = 46944.1 J\n\nNow, we need to calculate the heat of combustion per mole of propane. We can do this by dividing the total heat change by the moles of propane:\n\nΔH_combustion = ΔH_total / moles of propane = 46944.1 J / 0.2834 mol = 165,600 J/mol\n\nThe heat of combustion for propane gas is approximately 165,600 J/mol."
