    "message_2": "To identify the structure of an unknown compound (C10H12O2) using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we would need the actual NMR spectra data, which includes proton NMR (1H NMR) and carbon NMR (13C NMR) along with other 2D NMR techniques like COSY, HSQC, and HMBC. Since the data is not provided, I will give you a general guideline on how to approach the problem.\n\n1. First, analyze the molecular formula (C10H12O2) and calculate the degrees of unsaturation (DOU). DOU = (2C + 2 + N - H - X) / 2, where C is the number of carbons, N is the number of nitrogens, H is the number of hydrogens, and X is the number of halogens. In this case, DOU = (2 * 10 + 2 - 12) / 2 = 4. This indicates that there are four double bond equivalents, which could be a combination of double bonds, triple bonds, or rings.\n\n2. Analyze the 1H NMR spectrum: Look for the number of signals, their chemical shifts, splitting patterns, and integration values. This will give you information about the different types of protons in the molecule, their environment, and the number of protons in each environment.\n\n3. Analyze the 13C NMR spectrum: Look for the number of signals and their chemical shifts. This will give you information about the different types of carbons in the molecule and their environment.\n\n4. Use 2D NMR techniques like COSY, HSQC, and HMBC to establish correlations between protons and carbons, and to determine the connectivity of the atoms in the molecule.\n\n5. Based on the NMR data and the DOU value, propose possible structures for the compound. Look for functional groups, such as carbonyls, alcohols, or aromatic rings, based on the chemical shifts and splitting patterns.\n\n6. Compare the proposed structures with the NMR data and eliminate any structures that do not match the data. The remaining structure(s) should be the correct one(s).\n\nRemember, without the actual NMR spectra data, it is impossible to determine the exact structure of the compound. However, following these steps will help you analyze the data and identify the structure when you have the necessary information."
