    "message_2": "The radioactive isotope that emits gamma rays with the highest energy and corresponding wavelength in the gamma spectrum is Cobalt-60 (Co-60). Cobalt-60 undergoes beta decay and emits two gamma rays with energies of 1.17 MeV (mega-electron volts) and 1.33 MeV.\n\nTo find the corresponding wavelength, we can use the equation:\n\nE = h * c / λ\n\nWhere E is the energy, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and λ is the wavelength.\n\nFor the 1.33 MeV gamma ray:\n\n1.33 MeV = 1.33 x 10^6 eV = 1.33 x 10^6 x 1.6 x 10^-19 J (converting electron volts to joules)\n\nλ = h * c / E = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (1.33 x 10^6 x 1.6 x 10^-19 J)\n\nλ ≈ 9.4 x 10^-13 m\n\nSo, the highest energy gamma ray emitted by Cobalt-60 has an energy of 1.33 MeV and a corresponding wavelength of approximately 9.4 x 10^-13 meters."
