    "message_2": "The electrical conductivity of a solution is the ability of the solution to conduct electric current. This conductivity is primarily due to the presence of ions in the solution, which are formed when a soluble inorganic salt, like NaCl, dissolves in water.\n\nWhen the concentration of a soluble inorganic salt (e.g., NaCl) in a solution increases, the number of ions (Na+ and Cl-) in the solution also increases. As a result, the electrical conductivity of the solution increases because there are more ions available to carry the electric current.\n\nIn summary, increasing the concentration of a soluble inorganic salt in a solution will increase its electrical conductivity due to the increased number of ions present in the solution."
