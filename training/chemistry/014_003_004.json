    "message_2": "The coordination compound [Co(en)3]Cl3 exhibits both geometrical and optical isomerism. \n\nGeometrical isomerism:\nIn this compound, geometrical isomerism is due to the different possible arrangements of the ethylenediamine (en) ligands around the central cobalt (Co) atom. There are two possible geometrical isomers: fac-isomer and mer-isomer.\n\n1. fac-isomer: In the fac-isomer, the three ethylenediamine ligands are arranged in a facial manner, occupying three adjacent vertices of an octahedron around the central cobalt atom.\n\n2. mer-isomer: In the mer-isomer, the three ethylenediamine ligands are arranged in a meridional manner, occupying three vertices of an octahedron in a 180° plane around the central cobalt atom.\n\nOptical isomerism:\nOptical isomerism occurs due to the presence of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers) of the complex. The [Co(en)3]3+ complex has three bidentate ethylenediamine ligands, which can form chiral centers around the cobalt atom. Therefore, there are two possible optical isomers (enantiomers) for each geometrical isomer:\n\n1. fac-isomer: Δ-fac and Λ-fac enantiomers\n2. mer-isomer: Δ-mer and Λ-mer enantiomers\n\nIn summary, the coordination compound [Co(en)3]Cl3 exhibits four different isomers: two geometrical isomers (fac and mer) and two optical isomers (Δ and Λ) for each geometrical isomer."
