    "message_2": "When atoms of metal are held together by a sea of electrons, the type of inorganic solid formed is called a metallic solid or a metal lattice. This structure is characterized by the presence of positively charged metal ions surrounded by a delocalized cloud of electrons, which allows for good electrical and thermal conductivity."
