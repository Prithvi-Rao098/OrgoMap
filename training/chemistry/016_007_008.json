    "message_2": "The standard enthalpy of formation of a compound is the change in enthalpy when one mole of the compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. In this case, we want to find the standard enthalpy of formation of carbon dioxide (CO2) from its elements, carbon (C) and oxygen (O2).\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the formation of CO2 is:\n\nC (graphite) + O2 (g) → CO2 (g)\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation of carbon (C) in its standard state (graphite) is given as -94.05 kJ/mol, and the standard enthalpy of formation of oxygen (O2) in its standard state (gas) is given as 0 kJ/mol.\n\nHowever, the given enthalpy of formation for carbon (-94.05 kJ/mol) is incorrect. The standard enthalpy of formation for an element in its standard state is always 0 kJ/mol. Therefore, the correct standard enthalpy of formation for carbon (C) in its standard state (graphite) should be 0 kJ/mol.\n\nNow, we can use the following equation to find the standard enthalpy of formation of CO2:\n\nΔHf°(CO2) = [ΔHf°(CO2) - ΔHf°(C) - ΔHf°(O2)]\n\nSince the standard enthalpy of formation for both carbon and oxygen in their standard states is 0 kJ/mol, the equation simplifies to:\n\nΔHf°(CO2) = ΔHf°(CO2)\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation of CO2 is -393.5 kJ/mol."
