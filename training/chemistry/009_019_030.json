    "message_2": "As a chemist, I would need more information to determine the exact chemical structure of the compound with the molecular formula C9H12O. Proton NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) spectrum provides valuable information about the hydrogen atoms in a molecule, such as their chemical environment, number of neighboring hydrogen atoms, and the number of hydrogen atoms in each environment.\n\nTo determine the chemical structure, please provide the following information from the proton NMR spectrum:\n\n1. The number of signals (peaks) in the spectrum.\n2. The chemical shift values (in ppm) of each signal.\n3. The integration values (relative area under each peak) of each signal, which indicates the number of hydrogen atoms in each environment.\n4. The splitting pattern (multiplicity) of each signal, which can provide information about the number of neighboring hydrogen atoms.\n\nWith this information, I can help you interpret the proton NMR spectrum and determine the chemical structure of the compound."
