    "message_2": "The nucleophilic substitution reaction of 2-bromobutane with sodium hydroxide in ethanol follows the SN2 (Substitution Nucleophilic Bimolecular) mechanism. Here's a step-by-step description of the mechanism:\n\n1. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) dissociates into sodium (Na+) and hydroxide (OH-) ions in the ethanol solvent. The hydroxide ion acts as a nucleophile in this reaction.\n\n2. The nucleophile (OH-) attacks the electrophilic carbon atom (the one bonded to the bromine) in 2-bromobutane from the backside, opposite to the leaving group (Br-). This backside attack leads to the inversion of the stereochemistry at the electrophilic carbon.\n\n3. As the nucleophile forms a bond with the electrophilic carbon, the carbon-bromine bond starts to break, and the bromide ion (Br-) is released as the leaving group.\n\n4. The product formed is 2-butanol, with the hydroxide ion now bonded to the electrophilic carbon, and the bromide ion is released as a byproduct. The sodium ion (Na+) associates with the bromide ion (Br-) to form sodium bromide (NaBr) as a side product.\n\nOverall reaction:\n2-bromobutane + NaOH â†’ 2-butanol + NaBr\n\nThis SN2 mechanism occurs in a single concerted step, with the nucleophile attacking and the leaving group departing simultaneously. The reaction rate is dependent on the concentration of both the nucleophile and the substrate, hence the term \"bimolecular\" in the SN2 mechanism name."
