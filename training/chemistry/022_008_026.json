    "message_2": "In a single replacement reaction between iron (Fe) and copper chloride (CuCl2), iron will replace copper in the compound because it is more reactive. The expected outcome of this reaction will be the formation of iron chloride (FeCl2) and copper (Cu) as products. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nFe (s) + CuCl2 (aq) â†’ FeCl2 (aq) + Cu (s)"
