    "message_2": "To find the molar mass of aluminum sulfate, Al2(SO4)3, we need to calculate the molar mass of each element in the compound and then add them together.\n\n1. Aluminum (Al): The molar mass of aluminum is 26.98 g/mol. Since there are 2 aluminum atoms in the compound, the total mass of aluminum is 2 * 26.98 = 53.96 g/mol.\n\n2. Sulfur (S): The molar mass of sulfur is 32.07 g/mol. Since there are 3 sulfur atoms in each sulfate ion (SO4) and 3 sulfate ions in the compound, the total mass of sulfur is 3 * 3 * 32.07 = 288.63 g/mol.\n\n3. Oxygen (O): The molar mass of oxygen is 16.00 g/mol. Since there are 4 oxygen atoms in each sulfate ion (SO4) and 3 sulfate ions in the compound, the total mass of oxygen is 3 * 4 * 16.00 = 192.00 g/mol.\n\nNow, we add the molar masses of aluminum, sulfur, and oxygen together:\n\n53.96 (Al) + 288.63 (S) + 192.00 (O) = 534.59 g/mol\n\nThe molar mass of aluminum sulfate, Al2(SO4)3, is approximately 534.59 g/mol."
