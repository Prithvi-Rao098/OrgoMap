    "message_2": "Cytochrome c oxidase is a metalloenzyme that plays a crucial role in the electron transport chain as the terminal enzyme complex. It contains two metal ions in its active site: a copper ion (CuB) and a heme iron (Fea3). The coordination number and geometry of these metal ions are essential for the enzyme's function.\n\nThe coordination number of the copper ion (CuB) in the active site is typically 4, with a square planar geometry. The ligands coordinating the copper ion include three histidine residues and a nearby oxygen molecule. The heme iron (Fea3) has a coordination number of 6, with an octahedral geometry. The ligands coordinating the heme iron include a histidine residue, the porphyrin ring, and the oxygen molecule that bridges between the copper and iron ions.\n\nThe coordination geometry and number of the metal ions in the active site of cytochrome c oxidase are crucial for its function in the electron transport chain. The square planar geometry of the copper ion and the octahedral geometry of the heme iron allow for efficient electron transfer between the metal ions and the oxygen molecule. This electron transfer is essential for the reduction of molecular oxygen to water, which is the final step in the electron transport chain.\n\nAdditionally, the specific coordination of the metal ions in the active site allows for the proper binding and orientation of the oxygen molecule, which is necessary for the enzyme's catalytic activity. The coordination geometry and number also contribute to the enzyme's ability to prevent the formation of harmful reactive oxygen species during the reduction process.\n\nIn summary, the coordination number and geometry of the metal ions in the active site of cytochrome c oxidase play a critical role in the enzyme's function in the electron transport chain. The square planar geometry of the copper ion and the octahedral geometry of the heme iron enable efficient electron transfer and proper oxygen binding, ultimately facilitating the reduction of molecular oxygen to water."
