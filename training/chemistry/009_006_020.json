    "message_2": "The isotope notation for Carbon-14 is written as ¹⁴C or C-14, where 14 is the mass number (sum of protons and neutrons) and C is the chemical symbol for carbon.\n\nCarbon always has 6 protons, as its atomic number is 6. To find the number of neutrons, subtract the atomic number from the mass number: 14 - 6 = 8 neutrons.\n\nSince Carbon-14 is a neutral atom, the number of electrons is equal to the number of protons, which is 6.\n\nSo, Carbon-14 has 6 protons, 8 neutrons, and 6 electrons."
