    "message_2": "Caffeine has the molecular formula C8H10N4O2. To determine the percentage composition of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and nitrogen (N), we first need to find the molar mass of each element and the molar mass of caffeine.\n\nMolar mass of C: 12.01 g/mol\nMolar mass of H: 1.01 g/mol\nMolar mass of N: 14.01 g/mol\nMolar mass of O: 16.00 g/mol\n\nNow, let's calculate the molar mass of caffeine:\nCaffeine molar mass = (8 × 12.01) + (10 × 1.01) + (4 × 14.01) + (2 × 16.00)\nCaffeine molar mass = 96.08 + 10.10 + 56.04 + 32.00\nCaffeine molar mass = 194.22 g/mol\n\nNext, we'll find the percentage composition of each element:\n\nPercentage of C = (Total mass of C in caffeine / Molar mass of caffeine) × 100\nPercentage of C = (96.08 g / 194.22 g) × 100\nPercentage of C ≈ 49.48%\n\nPercentage of H = (Total mass of H in caffeine / Molar mass of caffeine) × 100\nPercentage of H = (10.10 g / 194.22 g) × 100\nPercentage of H ≈ 5.20%\n\nPercentage of N = (Total mass of N in caffeine / Molar mass of caffeine) × 100\nPercentage of N = (56.04 g / 194.22 g) × 100\nPercentage of N ≈ 28.85%\n\nSo, the percentage composition of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen in a sample of caffeine is approximately 49.48% carbon, 5.20% hydrogen, and 28.85% nitrogen."
