Suppose you are given the complex ion [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺. Using the crystal field theory, determine the number of unpaired electrons in this complex and predict its magnetic behavior.",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of unpaired electrons in the complex ion [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺ and predict its magnetic behavior using crystal field theory, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the oxidation state of the central metal ion (Fe).\n2. Determine the electron configuration of the central metal ion.\n3. Determine the geometry of the complex ion.\n4. Apply crystal field theory to determine the splitting of d-orbitals.\n5. Determine the number of unpaired electrons and predict the magnetic behavior.\n\nStep 1: Determine the oxidation state of the central metal ion (Fe)\nIn the complex ion [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺, the overall charge is +3. Since water (H₂O) is a neutral ligand, the oxidation state of Fe is +3.\n\nStep 2: Determine the electron configuration of the central metal ion\nThe electron configuration of Fe is [Ar] 3d⁶ 4s². In the +3 oxidation state, Fe loses 3 electrons (2 from the 4s orbital and 1 from the 3d orbital), resulting in the electron configuration [Ar] 3d⁵.\n\nStep 3: Determine the geometry of the complex ion\nThe complex ion [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺ has six water molecules as ligands, which results in an octahedral geometry.\n\nStep 4: Apply crystal field theory to determine the splitting of d-orbitals\nIn an octahedral geometry, the d-orbitals split into two sets due to the crystal field: the lower energy set (t₂g) consisting of dxy, dyz, and dxz orbitals, and the higher energy set (e_g) consisting of dx²-y² and dz² orbitals. The energy gap between these two sets is denoted as Δ₀ (crystal field splitting energy).\n\nWater is a weak field ligand, which means it causes a small splitting of the d-orbitals. In this case, the crystal field splitting energy (Δ₀) is smaller than the pairing energy (P), which is the energy required to pair two electrons in the same orbital. Therefore, electrons will occupy the higher energy orbitals (e_g) before pairing up in the lower energy orbitals (t₂g).\n\nStep 5: Determine the number of unpaired electrons and predict the magnetic behavior\nThe electron configuration of Fe³⁺ is [Ar] 3d⁵. In the presence of the weak field ligand (H₂O), the five d-electrons will occupy the d-orbitals as follows:\n\n- Three electrons will occupy the t₂g orbitals (one in each orbital).\n- Two electrons will occupy the e_g orbitals (one in each orbital).\n\nSince all five d-electrons are unpaired, the complex ion [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺ has five unpaired electrons. This means the complex is paramagnetic, as it will be attracted to an external magnetic field due to the presence of unpaired electrons."
