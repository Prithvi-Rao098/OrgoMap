    "message_2": "To calculate the heat capacity of the ethanol, we can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat absorbed (in Joules), m is the mass (in grams), c is the specific heat (in J/g°C), and ΔT is the change in temperature (in °C).\n\nWe are given the following information:\n- mass (m) = 25 grams\n- specific heat (c) = 2.44 J/g°C\n- initial temperature (T1) = 25°C\n- final temperature (T2) = 35°C\n- heat absorbed (q) = 150 Joules\n\nFirst, let's calculate the change in temperature (ΔT):\n\nΔT = T2 - T1\nΔT = 35°C - 25°C\nΔT = 10°C\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\n150 J = (25 g)(2.44 J/g°C)(10°C)\n\nTo solve for the heat capacity, we can divide both sides of the equation by the mass and the change in temperature:\n\nHeat capacity = 150 J / (25 g * 10°C)\nHeat capacity = 150 J / 250 g°C\nHeat capacity = 0.6 J/g°C\n\nThe heat capacity of the 25 grams of liquid ethanol at 25°C when heated from 25°C to 35°C by absorbing 150 Joules of heat is 0.6 J/g°C."
