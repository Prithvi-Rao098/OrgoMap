    "message_2": "To determine the volume of 0.2 M HCl needed to neutralize 50 mL of 0.1 M NaOH, we can use the concept of moles and the balanced chemical equation for the neutralization reaction:\n\nHCl + NaOH → NaCl + H2O\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of NaOH in the 50 mL solution:\n\nmoles of NaOH = (volume in L) × (concentration in M)\nmoles of NaOH = (50 mL × (1 L/1000 mL)) × 0.1 M\nmoles of NaOH = 0.005 moles\n\nSince the balanced chemical equation shows a 1:1 ratio between HCl and NaOH, we need an equal number of moles of HCl to neutralize the NaOH:\n\nmoles of HCl = 0.005 moles\n\nNow, we can find the volume of 0.2 M HCl needed to provide 0.005 moles of HCl:\n\nvolume of HCl = (moles of HCl) / (concentration in M)\nvolume of HCl = 0.005 moles / 0.2 M\nvolume of HCl = 0.025 L\n\nConverting the volume to milliliters:\n\nvolume of HCl = 0.025 L × (1000 mL/1 L)\nvolume of HCl = 25 mL\n\nTherefore, 25 mL of 0.2 M HCl is needed to completely neutralize 50 mL of 0.1 M NaOH."
