    "message_2": "To determine the mass of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine that can be produced, we need to first find the limiting reagent and then calculate the theoretical yield based on that limiting reagent.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the preparation of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine is:\n\nC6H3ClN2O4 + N2H4 → C6H3N4O4 + HCl\n\nMolar masses:\n2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (C6H3ClN2O4) = 202.56 g/mol\nHydrazine (N2H4) = 32.05 g/mol\n2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (C6H3N4O4) = 198.11 g/mol\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of each reactant:\n\nMoles of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene = 5.0 g / 202.56 g/mol = 0.0247 mol\nMoles of hydrazine = 2.5 g / 32.05 g/mol = 0.0780 mol\n\nNow, we need to find the limiting reagent. The stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, so we can compare the moles of each reactant directly:\n\nSince 0.0247 mol of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene is less than 0.0780 mol of hydrazine, 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene is the limiting reagent.\n\nNow, we can calculate the theoretical yield of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine:\n\nMoles of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine = 0.0247 mol (based on the 1:1 stoichiometry)\nMass of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine = 0.0247 mol × 198.11 g/mol = 4.89 g\n\nTherefore, the mass of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine that can be produced from 2.5 grams of hydrazine and 5.0 grams of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene is approximately 4.89 grams."
