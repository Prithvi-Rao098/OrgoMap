    "message_2": "To find the pH of a 0.10 M solution of acetic acid with a Ka of 1.8 × 10^(-5), we can use the formula for the ionization of a weak acid:\n\nKa = [H+][A-]/[HA]\n\nWhere Ka is the acid dissociation constant, [H+] is the concentration of hydrogen ions, [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base, and [HA] is the concentration of the undissociated acid.\n\nSince the initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.10 M, we can assume that the change in concentration due to ionization is small compared to the initial concentration. Therefore, we can approximate the concentrations as follows:\n\n[H+] = x\n[A-] = x\n[HA] = 0.10 - x ≈ 0.10\n\nNow we can plug these values into the Ka expression:\n\n1.8 × 10^(-5) = x^2 / 0.10\n\nSolve for x:\n\nx^2 = 1.8 × 10^(-5) × 0.10\nx^2 = 1.8 × 10^(-6)\nx = √(1.8 × 10^(-6))\nx ≈ 1.34 × 10^(-3)\n\nSince x represents the concentration of hydrogen ions [H+], we can now calculate the pH using the pH formula:\n\npH = -log[H+]\npH = -log(1.34 × 10^(-3))\npH ≈ 2.87\n\nTherefore, the pH of the 0.10 M solution of acetic acid is approximately 2.87."
