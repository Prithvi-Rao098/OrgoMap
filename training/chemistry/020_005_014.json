    "message_1": "What will be the effect on the equilibrium position and concentration of products and reactants if we add more reactants to a reaction at equilibrium?",
    "message_2": "When more reactants are added to a reaction at equilibrium, the system will respond by shifting the equilibrium position to counteract the change, according to Le Chatelier's principle. In this case, the equilibrium will shift towards the side of the products to consume the excess reactants.\n\nAs a result, the concentration of the products will increase, while the concentration of the reactants will decrease until a new equilibrium is established. This new equilibrium position will still follow the same equilibrium constant, but the concentrations of the reactants and products will be different from the initial state."
