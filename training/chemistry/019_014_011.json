    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the precipitation reaction, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nBaCl2(aq) + Na2SO4(aq) → BaSO4(s) + 2NaCl(aq)\n\nNext, we need to determine the moles of each reactant:\n\nMoles of BaCl2 = mass / molar mass = 5.00 g / (137.33 g/mol + 2 * 35.45 g/mol) = 5.00 g / 208.23 g/mol = 0.0240 mol\nMoles of Na2SO4 = mass / molar mass = 5.00 g / (2 * 22.99 g/mol + 32.07 g/mol + 4 * 16.00 g/mol) = 5.00 g / 142.04 g/mol = 0.0352 mol\n\nNow we need to determine the limiting reactant:\n\nBaCl2: 0.0240 mol / 1 = 0.0240\nNa2SO4: 0.0352 mol / 1 = 0.0352\n\nSince the value for BaCl2 is smaller, it is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow, we need to find the standard enthalpy change for the reaction. This can be done using the standard enthalpies of formation for each compound:\n\nΔH°(BaCl2) = -858 kJ/mol\nΔH°(Na2SO4) = -1384 kJ/mol\nΔH°(BaSO4) = -1434 kJ/mol\nΔH°(NaCl) = -411 kJ/mol\n\nUsing Hess's Law, we can calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nΔH°rxn = [ΔH°(BaSO4) + 2ΔH°(NaCl)] - [ΔH°(BaCl2) + ΔH°(Na2SO4)] = (-1434 kJ/mol + 2 * -411 kJ/mol) - (-858 kJ/mol - 1384 kJ/mol) = -2256 kJ/mol + 2242 kJ/mol = -14 kJ/mol\n\nFinally, we need to multiply the standard enthalpy change by the moles of the limiting reactant to find the total enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nΔH = ΔH°rxn * moles of limiting reactant = -14 kJ/mol * 0.0240 mol = -0.336 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the precipitation reaction between 5.00 grams of BaCl2 and 5.00 grams of Na2SO4 under standard conditions is -0.336 kJ."
