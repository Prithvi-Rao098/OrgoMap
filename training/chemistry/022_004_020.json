The student is asked to predict the products and balance the chemical equation for the redox reaction that occurs when the two solutions are mixed. What is the balanced chemical equation for the redox reaction that occurs between iron(III) sulfate and potassium iodide?",
    "message_2": "When iron(III) sulfate (Fe2(SO4)3) reacts with potassium iodide (KI), the products formed are iron(II) sulfate (FeSO4), potassium sulfate (K2SO4), and iodine (I2). The balanced chemical equation for the redox reaction is:\n\n2 Fe2(SO4)3 + 6 KI â†’ 4 FeSO4 + 3 K2SO4 + 3 I2"
