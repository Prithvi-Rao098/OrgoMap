    "message_1": "If 0.1 moles of NOCl(g) were added to a 2 L container already in equilibrium according to the equation NOCl(g) ⇌ NO(g) + Cl2(g), what would be the new concentrations of NO(g), Cl2(g), and NOCl(g)? Given that the original concentrations of NO(g) and Cl2(g) were both 0.1 M and that the equilibrium constant, Kc, for the reaction is 5.5 x 10^-3 at the temperature of the experiment.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the initial concentration of NOCl(g) in the container. Since the container is already in equilibrium, we can use the equilibrium constant expression:\n\nKc = [NO][Cl2] / [NOCl]^2\n\nGiven that Kc = 5.5 x 10^-3, [NO] = [Cl2] = 0.1 M, we can solve for [NOCl]:\n\n5.5 x 10^-3 = (0.1)(0.1) / [NOCl]^2\n[NOCl]^2 = (0.1)(0.1) / (5.5 x 10^-3)\n[NOCl] = sqrt(0.01 / 5.5 x 10^-3) ≈ 0.134 M\n\nNow, we add 0.1 moles of NOCl(g) to the 2 L container. The new concentration of NOCl(g) will be:\n\n[NOCl]new = (0.134 M * 2 L + 0.1 moles) / 2 L ≈ 0.184 M\n\nSince the system is no longer in equilibrium, we need to find the change in concentrations to reach equilibrium again. Let's represent the change in concentration of NO and Cl2 as x and the change in concentration of NOCl as 2x (since 1 mole of NOCl produces 1 mole of NO and 1 mole of Cl2):\n\n[NO]new = 0.1 + x\n[Cl2]new = 0.1 + x\n[NOCl]new = 0.184 - 2x\n\nNow, we can use the equilibrium constant expression again:\n\nKc = ([NO]new)([Cl2]new) / ([NOCl]new)^2\n\n5.5 x 10^-3 = ((0.1 + x)(0.1 + x)) / (0.184 - 2x)^2\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of x. Solving for x, we get:\n\nx ≈ 0.014\n\nNow, we can find the new equilibrium concentrations:\n\n[NO]new = 0.1 + 0.014 ≈ 0.114 M\n[Cl2]new = 0.1 + 0.014 ≈ 0.114 M\n[NOCl]new = 0.184 - 2(0.014) ≈ 0.156 M\n\nSo, the new equilibrium concentrations are approximately 0.114 M for NO(g), 0.114 M for Cl2(g), and 0.156 M for NOCl(g)."
