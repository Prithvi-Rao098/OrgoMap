    "message_2": "Isotopic labeling is a technique used in chemistry to track the movement of atoms through chemical reactions by substituting one or more atoms in a molecule with their isotopes. Isotopes are atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons, resulting in different atomic masses. By using isotopes with distinct properties, such as radioactivity or altered mass, chemists can monitor the fate of these labeled atoms in the course of a reaction, providing valuable insights into the reaction mechanism.\n\nIsotopic labeling can be used to study the mechanism of chemical reactions by following the labeled atoms as they move through the reaction pathway. This can help determine the order of events in a reaction, identify intermediate species, and reveal the role of specific atoms in the reaction.\n\nOne example of isotopic labeling being used to study a chemical reaction is the investigation of the mechanism of the enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of esters, such as the reaction of acetylcholine with acetylcholinesterase. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in the nervous system, and acetylcholinesterase is an enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine to terminate its action.\n\nIn this study, the oxygen atom in the ester functional group of acetylcholine was replaced with its isotope, oxygen-18 (18O). The reaction was then carried out in the presence of water containing the normal isotope of oxygen, oxygen-16 (16O). By monitoring the distribution of 18O and 16O in the products, researchers were able to determine the source of the oxygen atom in the hydrolyzed products.\n\nThe findings showed that the oxygen atom from the labeled acetylcholine (18O) was found in the acetate product, while the oxygen atom from water (16O) was found in the choline product. This provided evidence that the enzyme acetylcholinesterase uses a direct nucleophilic attack mechanism, where the oxygen atom from water attacks the ester bond in acetylcholine, leading to the formation of acetate and choline.\n\nIn conclusion, isotopic labeling is a powerful technique in chemistry that allows researchers to study the mechanism of chemical reactions by tracking the movement of atoms through the reaction pathway. The example of acetylcholine hydrolysis demonstrates how isotopic labeling can provide valuable insights into the reaction mechanism and help elucidate the role of specific atoms in the reaction."
