    "message_1": "What is the identity of an unknown organic compound based on its IR spectrum, given peaks at 3400 cm-1 and 1700 cm-1?",
    "message_2": "Based on the given IR spectrum peaks, the unknown organic compound likely contains the following functional groups:\n\n1. A broad peak at 3400 cm-1 indicates the presence of an O-H group, which could be from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.\n2. A sharp peak at 1700 cm-1 suggests the presence of a C=O (carbonyl) group, which could be from an aldehyde, ketone, carboxylic acid, or ester.\n\nConsidering both peaks together, the most probable identity of the unknown organic compound is a carboxylic acid, as it contains both the O-H and C=O functional groups. However, further analysis, such as NMR spectroscopy, would be necessary to confirm the exact structure and identity of the compound."
