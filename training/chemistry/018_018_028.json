    "message_2": "When a chemical reaction is at equilibrium, the rate of the forward reaction is equal to the rate of the reverse reaction. This means that the concentrations of reactants and products remain constant over time, even though the reactions are still occurring.\n\nAccording to Le Chatelier's principle, if a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in concentration of reactants or products, the system will adjust itself to counteract the change and re-establish a new equilibrium.\n\nIf the concentration of reactants is increased, the system will shift towards the products to counteract the change, thus increasing the rate of the forward reaction. Conversely, if the concentration of products is increased, the system will shift towards the reactants, increasing the rate of the reverse reaction.\n\nSimilarly, if the concentration of reactants is decreased, the system will shift towards the reactants, increasing the rate of the reverse reaction. If the concentration of products is decreased, the system will shift towards the products, increasing the rate of the forward reaction.\n\nIn summary, changes in the concentration of reactants and products can temporarily affect the reaction rate at equilibrium. However, the system will eventually adjust itself to re-establish a new equilibrium, where the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are once again equal."
