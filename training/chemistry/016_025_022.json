    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change, we first need to determine the number of moles of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) that are being dissolved. The molar mass of NaOH is approximately 40.0 g/mol (23.0 g/mol for Na, 16.0 g/mol for O, and 1.0 g/mol for H).\n\nNumber of moles of NaOH = (mass of NaOH) / (molar mass of NaOH)\nNumber of moles of NaOH = (50.0 g) / (40.0 g/mol)\nNumber of moles of NaOH = 1.25 mol\n\nNow that we have the number of moles of NaOH, we can calculate the enthalpy change using the molar enthalpy of dissolution.\n\nEnthalpy change = (number of moles of NaOH) × (molar enthalpy of dissolution)\nEnthalpy change = (1.25 mol) × (-44.51 kJ/mol)\nEnthalpy change = -55.64 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change when 50.0 g of sodium hydroxide dissolves in 500.0 mL of water at a constant temperature of 25°C is -55.64 kJ."
