    "message_2": "The decomposition of N2O5 is a first-order reaction, which means that the rate of the reaction depends on the concentration of N2O5. The rate law for a first-order reaction is:\n\nrate = k[N2O5]\n\nwhere k is the rate constant and [N2O5] is the concentration of N2O5.\n\nThe half-life (t1/2) of a first-order reaction is related to the rate constant by the following equation:\n\nt1/2 = 0.693 / k\n\nGiven the half-life (t1/2) of 15.6 minutes, we can solve for the rate constant (k):\n\n15.6 minutes = 0.693 / k\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for k:\n\nk = 0.693 / 15.6 minutes\n\nk â‰ˆ 0.0445 min^(-1)\n\nSo, the rate constant for the decomposition of N2O5 at 298 K is approximately 0.0445 min^(-1)."
