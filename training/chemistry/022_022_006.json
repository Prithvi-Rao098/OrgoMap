    "message_2": "Increasing the concentration of reactants in a chemical reaction will shift the equilibrium position towards the products, according to Le Chatelier's principle. Le Chatelier's principle states that if a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in concentration, temperature, or pressure, the system will adjust itself to counteract the change and restore a new equilibrium state.\n\nFor example, consider the following reversible reaction:\n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) â‡Œ 2NH3(g)\n\nIn this reaction, nitrogen gas (N2) reacts with hydrogen gas (H2) to form ammonia gas (NH3). If we increase the concentration of N2 or H2, the system will try to counteract this change by consuming more of the reactants to form more NH3, thereby shifting the equilibrium position towards the products.\n\nUsing Le Chatelier's principle, we can predict that increasing the concentration of N2 or H2 will result in an increase in the concentration of NH3 at equilibrium. Conversely, if the concentration of NH3 were to be increased, the equilibrium position would shift towards the reactants, resulting in an increase in the concentrations of N2 and H2 at equilibrium."
