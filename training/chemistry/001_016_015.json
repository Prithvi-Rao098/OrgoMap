    "message_2": "As a text-based AI, I cannot draw the mechanism, but I can describe it for you. The reaction between ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and HBr (hydrogen bromide) is an acid-catalyzed substitution reaction, specifically an SN1 reaction. The overall reaction is:\n\nCH3CH2OH + HBr → CH3CH2Br + H2O\n\nHere's the step-by-step mechanism:\n\n1. Protonation of the alcohol: The lone pair of electrons on the oxygen atom of the ethanol molecule attacks the hydrogen atom of the HBr molecule. This results in the formation of a protonated alcohol (CH3CH2OH2+) and a bromide ion (Br-).\n\nCH3CH2OH + HBr → CH3CH2OH2+ + Br-\n\n2. Formation of the carbocation: The protonated alcohol molecule undergoes heterolysis, where the bond between the oxygen and the carbon atom breaks, and both electrons go to the oxygen atom. This results in the formation of a water molecule (H2O) and a carbocation intermediate (CH3CH2+).\n\nCH3CH2OH2+ → CH3CH2+ + H2O\n\n3. Nucleophilic attack: The bromide ion (Br-) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbocation (CH3CH2+), forming a new bond between the carbon and the bromine atom. This results in the formation of the final product, bromoethane (CH3CH2Br).\n\nCH3CH2+ + Br- → CH3CH2Br\n\nThe overall mechanism involves the initial protonation of the alcohol, followed by the formation of a carbocation intermediate and the nucleophilic attack by the bromide ion. The final products are bromoethane and water."
