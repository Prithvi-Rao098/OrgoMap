    "message_1": "What is the concentration of ferrous ions in a solution if the reduction potential of Fe2+ to Fe is found to be -0.44 V and the current supplied to the solution during the electrolysis of a 50 mL solution of the same was found to be 2.5 A for a total of 50 minutes under standard conditions (25°C and 1 atm)?",
    "message_2": "To find the concentration of ferrous ions (Fe2+) in the solution, we can use the concept of electrolysis and Faraday's laws of electrolysis.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total charge (Q) passed through the solution during electrolysis. We can use the formula:\n\nQ = I × t\n\nwhere Q is the total charge, I is the current (2.5 A), and t is the time (50 minutes = 3000 seconds).\n\nQ = 2.5 A × 3000 s = 7500 C (Coulombs)\n\nNow, we can use Faraday's first law of electrolysis, which states that the amount of substance deposited or dissolved at an electrode is directly proportional to the charge passed through the solution.\n\nn = Q / (z × F)\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of the substance, Q is the total charge, z is the number of electrons transferred in the redox reaction (for Fe2+ to Fe, z = 2), and F is the Faraday constant (96485 C/mol).\n\nn = 7500 C / (2 × 96485 C/mol) = 0.0389 mol\n\nNow that we have the number of moles of Fe2+ ions, we can find the concentration of Fe2+ ions in the solution:\n\nConcentration = n / V\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of Fe2+ ions (0.0389 mol) and V is the volume of the solution (50 mL = 0.05 L).\n\nConcentration = 0.0389 mol / 0.05 L = 0.778 mol/L\n\nTherefore, the concentration of ferrous ions (Fe2+) in the solution is 0.778 mol/L."
