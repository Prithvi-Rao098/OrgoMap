    "message_2": "To calculate the rate of diffusion of oxygen through a 2 cm thick slab of air, we can use Fick's first law of diffusion:\n\nJ = -D * (dC/dx)\n\nwhere J is the diffusion flux (the amount of substance passing through a unit area per unit time), D is the diffusivity of the substance (0.20 cm^2/s for oxygen), and dC/dx is the concentration gradient across the slab.\n\nHowever, we do not have enough information to determine the concentration gradient (dC/dx) in this problem. If you can provide the initial and final concentrations of oxygen on either side of the slab, we can calculate the rate of diffusion."
