    "message_1": "What is the equilibrium constant (Kc) of the reaction if 2 moles of nitric oxide (NO) and 1 mole of oxygen gas (O2) are allowed to react in a 2-liter container and at equilibrium, 1.2 moles of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are formed? The balanced equation for the reaction is given below:\n\n2 NO(g) + O2(g) ⇌ 2 NO2(g)",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction, we first need to determine the equilibrium concentrations of all species involved in the reaction.\n\nInitially, we have:\nNO = 2 moles\nO2 = 1 mole\nNO2 = 0 moles\n\nAt equilibrium, we have:\nNO2 = 1.2 moles (given)\n\nSince 2 moles of NO react to form 2 moles of NO2, the change in moles of NO is equal to the change in moles of NO2. Therefore, the moles of NO at equilibrium are:\nNO = 2 - 1.2 = 0.8 moles\n\nSimilarly, since 1 mole of O2 reacts to form 2 moles of NO2, the change in moles of O2 is half the change in moles of NO2. Therefore, the moles of O2 at equilibrium are:\nO2 = 1 - (1.2 / 2) = 0.4 moles\n\nNow, we can find the equilibrium concentrations by dividing the moles by the volume of the container (2 liters):\n[NO] = 0.8 moles / 2 L = 0.4 M\n[O2] = 0.4 moles / 2 L = 0.2 M\n[NO2] = 1.2 moles / 2 L = 0.6 M\n\nFinally, we can find the equilibrium constant (Kc) using the balanced equation and the equilibrium concentrations:\n\nKc = [NO2]^2 / ([NO]^2 * [O2])\n\nKc = (0.6)^2 / ((0.4)^2 * (0.2))\n\nKc = 0.36 / (0.16 * 0.2)\n\nKc = 0.36 / 0.032\n\nKc ≈ 11.25\n\nThe equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction is approximately 11.25."
