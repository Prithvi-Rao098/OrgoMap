    "message_2": "To calculate the formal charge of the carbon atom in CH3COOH (acetic acid), we need to consider the Lewis structure of the molecule. The molecule can be written as CH3-COOH, where the carbon atom we are interested in is the one bonded to the hydroxyl group (OH).\n\nThe Lewis structure of CH3COOH is:\n\n      O\n      ||\nH - C - C - O - H\n    |\n    H\n\nNow, let's calculate the formal charge of the carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group (OH):\n\nFormal charge = (Valence electrons of carbon) - (Non-bonding electrons) - (1/2 x Bonding electrons)\n\nCarbon has 4 valence electrons. In the given structure, the carbon atom has no non-bonding electrons (lone pairs). It is bonded to one hydrogen atom, one oxygen atom (double bond), and one carbon atom (single bond), so it has a total of 4 bonding electrons.\n\nFormal charge = 4 - 0 - (1/2 x 4)\nFormal charge = 4 - 2\nFormal charge = 2\n\nTherefore, the formal charge of the carbon atom in the compound CH3COOH is 0."
