    "message_2": "To calculate the corrosion potential of copper metal submerged in seawater at 25°C with a pH level of 8.2, we will use the Nernst equation. The Nernst equation is given by:\n\nE = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\n\nwhere:\nE = corrosion potential\nE° = standard reduction potential\nR = gas constant (8.314 J/mol K)\nT = temperature in Kelvin (25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K)\nn = number of electrons transferred in the redox reaction\nF = Faraday's constant (96485 C/mol)\nQ = reaction quotient\n\nThe redox reaction for copper in seawater is:\n\nCu2+ + 2e- -> Cu(s)\n\nThe standard reduction potential (E°) for this reaction is +0.337 V. The number of electrons transferred (n) is 2.\n\nThe reaction quotient (Q) can be calculated using the concentration of Cu2+ ions in seawater. The concentration of Cu2+ ions in seawater is approximately 2.3 x 10^-9 M.\n\nNow we can plug these values into the Nernst equation:\n\nE = 0.337 - (8.314 * 298.15 / (2 * 96485)) * ln(2.3 x 10^-9)\n\nE = 0.337 - (0.043 / 2) * ln(2.3 x 10^-9)\n\nE = 0.337 - 0.0215 * (-19.98)\n\nE = 0.337 + 0.4297\n\nE ≈ 0.767 V\n\nThe corrosion potential of copper metal submerged in seawater at 25°C with a pH level of 8.2 is approximately 0.767 V."
