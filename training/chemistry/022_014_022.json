    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of stoichiometry. First, we need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between magnesium and oxygen gas:\n\n2 Mg (s) + O2 (g) â†’ 2 MgO (s)\n\nNext, we need to determine the molar mass of each substance:\n\nMg: 24.31 g/mol\nO2: 2 * 16.00 g/mol = 32.00 g/mol\nMgO: 24.31 g/mol + 16.00 g/mol = 40.31 g/mol\n\nNow, we need to determine the limiting reactant. To do this, we will convert the mass of each reactant to moles:\n\nmoles of Mg = 5.0 g / 24.31 g/mol = 0.2056 mol\nmoles of O2 = 4.0 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.1250 mol\n\nNow, we will compare the mole ratio of Mg to O2 in the balanced equation (2:1) to the mole ratio of the given amounts:\n\nMg/O2 = (0.2056 mol Mg) / (0.1250 mol O2) = 1.6448\n\nSince the mole ratio of Mg to O2 in the balanced equation is 2:1, and the given mole ratio is greater than 2:1 (1.6448), this means that Mg is in excess and O2 is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow, we can determine the moles of MgO produced using the stoichiometry of the balanced equation:\n\nmoles of MgO = moles of O2 * (2 moles of MgO / 1 mole of O2) = 0.1250 mol * 2 = 0.2500 mol\n\nFinally, we can convert the moles of MgO to grams:\n\nmass of MgO = moles of MgO * molar mass of MgO = 0.2500 mol * 40.31 g/mol = 10.08 g\n\nSo, 10.08 grams of magnesium oxide would be formed if 5.0 grams of magnesium completely reacts with 4.0 grams of oxygen gas."
