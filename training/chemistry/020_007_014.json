    "message_2": "The predicted effect of increasing the pressure on the equilibrium position of an exothermic reaction that has fewer moles of gas on the product side than the reactant side is that the equilibrium will shift towards the side with fewer moles of gas, which is the product side. This shift occurs because the system will attempt to counteract the increased pressure by reducing the total number of gas moles, thus minimizing the pressure change according to Le Chatelier's principle."
