    "message_2": "In PCl5 (Phosphorus Pentachloride), the central atom is phosphorus (P). To determine the hybridization of the central atom, we need to consider the number of electron domains around it.\n\nPhosphorus has 5 valence electrons, and each chlorine atom contributes one electron. Therefore, there are a total of 5 + 5 = 10 electrons around the central phosphorus atom. These electrons are distributed in 5 electron domains (5 P-Cl bonds).\n\nAccording to the VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) theory, the electron domains will arrange themselves to minimize repulsion. In this case, the electron domains form a trigonal bipyramidal arrangement.\n\nTo accommodate 5 electron domains, the central phosphorus atom undergoes hybridization, which is the mixing of atomic orbitals to form new hybrid orbitals. In this case, one s orbital, three p orbitals, and one d orbital (from the third shell) mix to form five sp3d hybrid orbitals.\n\nSo, the hybridization of the central atom (phosphorus) in PCl5 is sp3d."
