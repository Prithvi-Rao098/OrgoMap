The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nCH4 (g) + 2 O2 (g) -> CO2 (g) + 2 H2O (g)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the entropy change (ΔS) for the combustion of methane, we need to use the standard molar entropies of the reactants and products involved in the reaction. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nCH4 (g) + 2 O2 (g) -> CO2 (g) + 2 H2O (g)\n\nThe entropy change for the reaction can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nΔS = ΣnS(products) - ΣnS(reactants)\n\nwhere n is the stoichiometric coefficient and S is the standard molar entropy.\n\nFor the reactants:\n- 1 mol of CH4 (g) has a standard molar entropy of 186.3 J/K/mol\n- 2 mol of O2 (g) have a standard molar entropy of 205.0 J/K/mol each\n\nFor the products:\n- 1 mol of CO2 (g) has a standard molar entropy of 213.7 J/K/mol (not provided in the problem, but can be found in standard chemistry references)\n- 2 mol of H2O (g) have a standard molar entropy of 188.7 J/K/mol each\n\nNow, we can calculate the entropy change:\n\nΔS = [(1 × 213.7) + (2 × 188.7)] - [(1 × 186.3) + (2 × 205.0)]\nΔS = (213.7 + 377.4) - (186.3 + 410.0)\nΔS = 591.1 - 596.3\nΔS = -5.2 J/K\n\nThe entropy change for the combustion of methane at 298 K and 1 atm pressure is -5.2 J/K."
