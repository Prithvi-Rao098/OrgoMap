    "message_2": "The reaction between ethene (C2H4) and hydrogen bromide (HBr) is an example of an electrophilic addition reaction. The mechanism for this reaction involves two main steps, and the intermediate formed is a carbocation. Here's the detailed mechanism:\n\n1. Electrophilic attack on the alkene:\nEthene has a double bond between the two carbon atoms, which consists of a sigma (σ) bond and a pi (π) bond. The π bond has a high electron density, making it nucleophilic. On the other hand, hydrogen bromide is a polar molecule, with the hydrogen atom being partially positive (δ+) and the bromine atom being partially negative (δ-). This makes the hydrogen atom in HBr an electrophile.\n\nThe nucleophilic π electrons of the double bond in ethene attack the electrophilic hydrogen atom in HBr, forming a new C-H bond. Simultaneously, the H-Br bond breaks, and the electrons from the bond move to the bromine atom, forming a negatively charged bromide ion (Br-).\n\n2. Formation and reaction of the carbocation intermediate:\nWhen the π bond in ethene attacks the hydrogen atom, one of the carbon atoms loses its share of the π electrons, resulting in a positively charged carbocation intermediate. In this case, since both carbon atoms in ethene are equivalent, the carbocation can be formed on either carbon atom.\n\nThe carbocation is a highly reactive intermediate due to its positive charge. The negatively charged bromide ion (Br-) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the positively charged carbon atom in the carbocation, forming a new C-Br bond.\n\nThe final product of this reaction is bromoethane (C2H5Br), formed by the addition of HBr across the double bond in ethene. The nature of the intermediate involved in this reaction is a carbocation, which is stabilized by the neighboring carbon atom through hyperconjugation."
