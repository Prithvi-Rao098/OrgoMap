    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium concentrations, we can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\n2 KI + Cl2 ⇌ 2 KCl + I2\n\nInitial concentrations:\n[KI] = 0.200 M\n[Cl2] = 0.200 M\n[KCl] = 0 M (assuming no KCl is present initially)\n[I2] = 0 M (assuming no I2 is present initially)\n\nChange in concentrations:\nLet x be the change in concentration for KI and Cl2.\nThen, the change for KCl and I2 will be 2x and x, respectively.\n\nEquilibrium concentrations:\n[KI] = 0.200 - x\n[Cl2] = 0.200 - x\n[KCl] = 2x\n[I2] = x\n\nNow, we can use the equilibrium constant (Kc) expression to solve for x:\n\nKc = [KCl]^2 * [I2] / ([KI]^2 * [Cl2])\n\n9.0 x 10^-2 = (2x)^2 * x / ((0.200 - x)^2 * (0.200 - x))\n\nNow, we need to solve for x:\n\n9.0 x 10^-2 = 4x^3 / (0.200 - x)^3\n\nLet's assume that x is much smaller than 0.200, so we can simplify the equation:\n\n9.0 x 10^-2 ≈ 4x^3 / (0.200)^3\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nx ≈ (9.0 x 10^-2 * (0.200)^3) / 4\n\nx ≈ 0.0016 M\n\nNow, we can find the equilibrium concentrations:\n\n[KI] = 0.200 - x ≈ 0.200 - 0.0016 ≈ 0.1984 M\n[Cl2] = 0.200 - x ≈ 0.200 - 0.0016 ≈ 0.1984 M\n[KCl] = 2x ≈ 2 * 0.0016 ≈ 0.0032 M\n[I2] = x ≈ 0.0016 M\n\nSo, the equilibrium concentrations are approximately:\n[KI] ≈ 0.1984 M\n[Cl2] ≈ 0.1984 M\n[KCl] ≈ 0.0032 M\n[I2] ≈ 0.0016 M"
