    "message_2": "To find the percent composition of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), we first need to determine the molar mass of each element in the compound and then the molar mass of the entire compound. \n\n1. Sodium (Na): 1 atom x 22.99 g/mol = 22.99 g/mol\n2. Hydrogen (H): 1 atom x 1.01 g/mol = 1.01 g/mol\n3. Carbon (C): 1 atom x 12.01 g/mol = 12.01 g/mol\n4. Oxygen (O): 3 atoms x 16.00 g/mol = 48.00 g/mol\n\nNow, we add up the molar masses of each element to find the molar mass of NaHCO3:\n\nMolar mass of NaHCO3 = 22.99 g/mol (Na) + 1.01 g/mol (H) + 12.01 g/mol (C) + 48.00 g/mol (O) = 84.01 g/mol\n\nNext, we'll find the percent composition of each element in the compound by dividing the molar mass of the element by the molar mass of the compound and then multiplying by 100.\n\nPercent composition of Na = (22.99 g/mol / 84.01 g/mol) x 100 = 27.37%\nPercent composition of H = (1.01 g/mol / 84.01 g/mol) x 100 = 1.20%\nPercent composition of C = (12.01 g/mol / 84.01 g/mol) x 100 = 14.30%\nPercent composition of O = (48.00 g/mol / 84.01 g/mol) x 100 = 57.13%\n\nSo, the percent composition of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) is approximately:\n\n- Sodium (Na): 27.37%\n- Hydrogen (H): 1.20%\n- Carbon (C): 14.30%\n- Oxygen (O): 57.13%"
