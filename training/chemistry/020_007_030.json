    "message_2": "Le Chatelier's principle states that when a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in pressure, temperature, or concentration of reactants or products, the system will adjust itself to counteract the change and restore a new equilibrium.\n\nWhen the pressure of a system at equilibrium is changed, the equilibrium position will shift in the direction that counteracts the change in pressure. This can be predicted using Le Chatelier's principle.\n\nConsider the following reaction:\n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g)\n\nIn this reaction, 1 mole of nitrogen gas reacts with 3 moles of hydrogen gas to produce 2 moles of ammonia gas. The total number of moles of gas on the reactant side is 4, while on the product side, it is 2.\n\n1. Increasing pressure:\nWhen the pressure is increased, the equilibrium will shift in the direction that has fewer moles of gas to counteract the increase in pressure. In this case, the equilibrium will shift to the right (towards the formation of NH3) because there are fewer moles of gas on the product side.\n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g) (Shifts to the right)\n\n2. Decreasing pressure:\nWhen the pressure is decreased, the equilibrium will shift in the direction that has more moles of gas to counteract the decrease in pressure. In this case, the equilibrium will shift to the left (towards the formation of N2 and H2) because there are more moles of gas on the reactant side.\n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g) (Shifts to the left)\n\nIn summary, the equilibrium position in a reaction can be affected by changes in pressure, and these changes can be predicted using Le Chatelier's principle. When pressure is increased, the equilibrium shifts in the direction with fewer moles of gas, and when pressure is decreased, the equilibrium shifts in the direction with more moles of gas."
