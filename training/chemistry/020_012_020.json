    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to determine the initial concentrations of acetic acid (CH3COOH) and its conjugate base (CH3COO-).\n\nInitial concentrations:\n[CH3COOH] = 0.1 M (1% dissociated)\n[CH3COO-] = 0.1 M (from the problem statement)\n\nWhen 0.1 moles of HCl is added to the solution, it will react with the conjugate base (CH3COO-) to form more acetic acid (CH3COOH) and Cl-. The reaction can be represented as:\n\nHCl + CH3COO- → CH3COOH + Cl-\n\nSince HCl is a strong acid, it will completely dissociate, and 0.1 moles of CH3COO- will react with 0.1 moles of HCl.\n\nChange in concentrations due to the reaction:\nΔ[CH3COOH] = +0.1 moles\nΔ[CH3COO-] = -0.1 moles\n\nNew concentrations after the reaction:\n[CH3COOH] = 0.1 M + 0.1 moles = 0.2 M\n[CH3COO-] = 0.1 M - 0.1 moles = 0 M\n\nNow, we need to account for the dissociation of the new acetic acid concentration. Since the CH3COO- concentration is now 0 M, the acetic acid will dissociate more than the initial 1% to reach a new equilibrium.\n\nAt the new equilibrium, let x be the concentration of CH3COO- formed from the dissociation of CH3COOH:\n\nCH3COOH (0.2 - x) ↔ CH3COO- (x)\n\nSince the initial dissociation was 1%, we can assume that the new dissociation will be small compared to the initial concentration of CH3COOH. Therefore, we can approximate that x << 0.2, and the new equilibrium concentrations will be:\n\n[CH3COOH] ≈ 0.2 M\n[CH3COO-] ≈ x\n\nThe change in the equilibrium concentrations of the weak acid (HA) and its conjugate base (A-) after adding 0.1 moles of HCl is:\n\nΔ[CH3COOH] ≈ +0.1 M\nΔ[CH3COO-] ≈ -0.1 M"
