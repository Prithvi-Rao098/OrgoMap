    "message_2": "In non-equilibrium thermodynamics, the entropy of a system changes during an irreversible process, such as an exothermic chemical reaction. To understand this, let's first define some key concepts:\n\n1. Entropy (S) is a measure of the disorder or randomness of a system. In thermodynamics, it is often associated with the dispersal of energy and the number of possible microstates (configurations) of the system.\n\n2. An exothermic reaction is a chemical reaction that releases energy, usually in the form of heat, to its surroundings.\n\n3. An irreversible process is a process that cannot spontaneously return to its initial state without an external influence. In other words, it cannot be reversed without doing work on the system or changing the surroundings.\n\nNow, let's discuss how the entropy of a system changes during an irreversible exothermic reaction using non-equilibrium thermodynamics.\n\nIn an exothermic reaction, the products have lower energy than the reactants. As the reaction proceeds, energy is released into the surroundings, increasing the entropy of the surroundings. This is because the energy disperses into the surroundings, increasing the number of possible microstates and thus the disorder.\n\nHowever, the entropy change of the system itself depends on the specific reaction and the change in the number of particles and their energy states. In general, if the products have more particles or higher energy states than the reactants, the entropy of the system will increase. Conversely, if the products have fewer particles or lower energy states, the entropy of the system will decrease.\n\nSince the process is irreversible, the total entropy change of the system and its surroundings will be positive. This is in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the total entropy of an isolated system always increases during an irreversible process.\n\nIn summary, during an irreversible exothermic reaction, the entropy of the surroundings increases due to the release of energy. The entropy change of the system depends on the specific reaction and the change in the number of particles and their energy states. The total entropy change of the system and its surroundings will be positive, in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics."
