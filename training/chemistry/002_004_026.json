    "message_2": "To find the pH of the solution, we first need to determine the amount of moles of HCl and NaOH in the solution and then find the resulting concentration of H+ ions.\n\n1. Calculate the moles of HCl and NaOH:\nmoles of HCl = volume (L) × concentration (M)\nmoles of HCl = 0.020 L × 0.1 M = 0.002 moles\n\nmoles of NaOH = volume (L) × concentration (M)\nmoles of NaOH = 0.080 L × 0.05 M = 0.004 moles\n\n2. Determine the moles of H+ ions remaining after the reaction:\nSince HCl and NaOH react in a 1:1 ratio, we can subtract the moles of NaOH from the moles of HCl to find the moles of H+ ions remaining.\nmoles of H+ ions remaining = moles of HCl - moles of NaOH\nmoles of H+ ions remaining = 0.002 moles - 0.004 moles = -0.002 moles\n\nSince we have a negative value, it means that there are no H+ ions remaining, and we have an excess of OH- ions. We can now calculate the moles of OH- ions remaining.\n\n3. Determine the moles of OH- ions remaining:\nmoles of OH- ions remaining = moles of NaOH - moles of HCl\nmoles of OH- ions remaining = 0.004 moles - 0.002 moles = 0.002 moles\n\n4. Calculate the concentration of OH- ions:\ntotal volume of the solution = volume of HCl + volume of NaOH\ntotal volume of the solution = 0.020 L + 0.080 L = 0.100 L\n\nconcentration of OH- ions = moles of OH- ions / total volume (L)\nconcentration of OH- ions = 0.002 moles / 0.100 L = 0.02 M\n\n5. Calculate the pOH and pH of the solution:\npOH = -log10(concentration of OH- ions)\npOH = -log10(0.02) ≈ 1.70\n\npH = 14 - pOH\npH = 14 - 1.70 ≈ 12.30\n\nThe pH of the solution formed by adding 20 mL of 0.1 M HCl to 80 mL of 0.05 M NaOH is approximately 12.30."
