    "message_1": "The problem is,\n\nSuppose there is a chemical equilibrium reaction A(g) + B(g) ⇄ 2C(g) with a Kc of 0.20 at 400 K. Initially, there is only A and B in the mixture, with no C. If 0.75 moles of A and 1.2 moles of B are mixed in a 2.0 L container, what will be the final concentrations of A, B, and C at equilibrium?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first write the expression for the equilibrium constant (Kc) and then set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the final concentrations of A, B, and C at equilibrium.\n\nThe equilibrium constant expression for the given reaction is:\n\nKc = [C]^2 / ([A] * [B])\n\nInitially, we have 0.75 moles of A and 1.2 moles of B in a 2.0 L container. So, the initial concentrations are:\n\n[A] = 0.75 moles / 2.0 L = 0.375 M\n[B] = 1.2 moles / 2.0 L = 0.6 M\n[C] = 0 M (since there is no C initially)\n\nNow, let's set up the ICE table:\n\n          A(g)   +   B(g)  ⇄  2C(g)\nInitial:  0.375 M         0.6 M          0 M\nChange:  -x M             -x M          +2x M\nEquilibrium: 0.375-x M    0.6-x M        2x M\n\nNow, we can plug the equilibrium concentrations into the Kc expression:\n\n0.20 = (2x)^2 / ((0.375 - x) * (0.6 - x))\n\nSolving for x:\n\n0.20 = 4x^2 / ((0.375 - x) * (0.6 - x))\n\nNow, we can solve for x. This is a quadratic equation, and solving it gives us two possible values for x: x = 0.15 and x = 0.225. However, since x = 0.225 would result in a negative concentration for A, we discard this solution and use x = 0.15.\n\nNow we can find the equilibrium concentrations:\n\n[A] = 0.375 - x = 0.375 - 0.15 = 0.225 M\n[B] = 0.6 - x = 0.6 - 0.15 = 0.45 M\n[C] = 2x = 2 * 0.15 = 0.3 M\n\nSo, the final concentrations at equilibrium are:\n[A] = 0.225 M\n[B] = 0.45 M\n[C] = 0.3 M"
