    "message_2": "To calculate the bond order of the NO molecule using molecular orbital theory, we need to first determine the molecular orbitals and their electron configurations. \n\nFor diatomic molecules like NO, we can use the molecular orbital diagram for homonuclear diatomic molecules (e.g., N2, O2) as a reference, with some modifications due to the different atomic species. The molecular orbitals for NO are formed by the overlap of atomic orbitals from the nitrogen and oxygen atoms. \n\nThe valence electrons of nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O) are in the 2s and 2p orbitals. In the molecular orbital diagram, these atomic orbitals combine to form the following molecular orbitals:\n\n1. σ2s and σ*2s (from the overlap of 2s orbitals)\n2. σ2p, π2p, π*2p, and σ*2p (from the overlap of 2p orbitals)\n\nNow, let's fill the molecular orbitals with the total valence electrons from both atoms. Nitrogen has 4 valence electrons and oxygen has 6 valence electrons, giving a total of 10 valence electrons.\n\nThe molecular orbitals are filled in the following order:\n\n1. σ2s (2 electrons)\n2. σ*2s (2 electrons)\n3. σ2p (2 electrons)\n4. π2p (4 electrons)\n\nThe bond order can be calculated using the formula:\n\nBond Order = (Number of electrons in bonding orbitals - Number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\n\nIn the case of NO:\n\nBond Order = (2 + 2 + 4 - 2) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3\n\nTherefore, the bond order of the NO molecule is 3."
