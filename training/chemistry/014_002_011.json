    "message_2": "The substitution reaction between [Fe(H2O)6]2+ and NH3 to form [Fe(NH3)6]2+ can be explained using coordination chemistry principles. The reaction involves the replacement of water molecules (H2O) coordinated to the central iron (Fe) atom with ammonia molecules (NH3). The mechanism for this reaction can be described in the following steps:\n\n1. Formation of the initial complex: The hexaaqua complex, [Fe(H2O)6]2+, consists of a central Fe2+ ion surrounded by six water molecules acting as ligands. These water molecules are coordinated to the Fe2+ ion through their oxygen atoms, forming coordinate covalent bonds.\n\n2. Ligand exchange: Ammonia (NH3) is a stronger ligand than water (H2O) due to its higher electron-donating ability. As a result, NH3 molecules can replace the H2O molecules in the coordination sphere of the Fe2+ ion. This process is called ligand exchange or ligand substitution.\n\n3. Stepwise substitution: The ligand exchange process occurs stepwise, with one NH3 molecule replacing one H2O molecule at a time. The substitution can be described by the following series of equilibrium reactions:\n\n[Fe(H2O)6]2+ + NH3 ⇌ [Fe(H2O)5(NH3)]2+ + H2O\n[Fe(H2O)5(NH3)]2+ + NH3 ⇌ [Fe(H2O)4(NH3)2]2+ + H2O\n[Fe(H2O)4(NH3)2]2+ + NH3 ⇌ [Fe(H2O)3(NH3)3]2+ + H2O\n[Fe(H2O)3(NH3)3]2+ + NH3 ⇌ [Fe(H2O)2(NH3)4]2+ + H2O\n[Fe(H2O)2(NH3)4]2+ + NH3 ⇌ [Fe(H2O)(NH3)5]2+ + H2O\n[Fe(H2O)(NH3)5]2+ + NH3 ⇌ [Fe(NH3)6]2+ + H2O\n\n4. Completion of the reaction: As the reaction progresses, more and more water molecules are replaced by ammonia molecules. Eventually, all six water molecules are replaced by ammonia molecules, resulting in the formation of the final product, [Fe(NH3)6]2+.\n\nIn summary, the substitution reaction between [Fe(H2O)6]2+ and NH3 to form [Fe(NH3)6]2+ involves a stepwise ligand exchange process, in which ammonia molecules replace water molecules in the coordination sphere of the Fe2+ ion due to their stronger electron-donating ability."
