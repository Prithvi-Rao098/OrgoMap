    "message_2": "To calculate the formal charge of nitrogen in the NO₃⁻ molecule, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the number of valence electrons for nitrogen (N). Nitrogen is in group 15, so it has 5 valence electrons.\n\n2. Calculate the number of bonding electrons. In the NO₃⁻ molecule, nitrogen is bonded to three oxygen atoms with single bonds. Each bond consists of 2 electrons, so there are 3 bonds x 2 electrons = 6 bonding electrons.\n\n3. Calculate the number of non-bonding electrons. Nitrogen has one lone pair of electrons in the NO₃⁻ molecule, which means there are 2 non-bonding electrons.\n\n4. Calculate the formal charge using the formula: Formal charge = (Valence electrons) - (Non-bonding electrons) - 0.5 * (Bonding electrons)\n\nFormal charge of nitrogen = (5) - (2) - 0.5 * (6) = 5 - 2 - 3 = 0\n\nThe formal charge of nitrogen in the NO₃⁻ molecule is 0."
