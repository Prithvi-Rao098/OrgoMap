    "message_1": "Calculate the standard Gibbs free energy change for the electrochemical cell reaction using the given half-reactions:\n\nCu^2+(aq) + 2 e^- → Cu(s)   E° = +0.34 V\n\nSn^4+(aq) + 2 e^- → Sn^2+(aq)   E° = +0.15 V\n\nConstruct the cell diagram and identify the anode and cathode. Determine the overall cell potential and whether the reaction is spontaneous.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to balance the half-reactions to have the same number of electrons. In this case, both half-reactions involve 2 electrons, so they are already balanced.\n\nNext, we need to determine which half-reaction will be the reduction (cathode) and which will be the oxidation (anode). The half-reaction with the higher standard reduction potential (E°) will be the reduction, and the other will be the oxidation. In this case, Cu^2+ has a higher E° (+0.34 V) than Sn^4+ (+0.15 V), so Cu^2+ will be reduced, and Sn^4+ will be oxidized.\n\nNow we can write the overall cell reaction by combining the two half-reactions:\n\nCu^2+(aq) + Sn^2+(aq) → Cu(s) + Sn^4+(aq)\n\nThe cell diagram can be constructed as follows:\n\nSn(s) | Sn^2+(aq) || Cu^2+(aq) | Cu(s)\n\nThe anode is Sn(s) and the cathode is Cu(s).\n\nTo calculate the overall cell potential (E°cell), we subtract the standard reduction potential of the anode from the standard reduction potential of the cathode:\n\nE°cell = E°cathode - E°anode\nE°cell = (+0.34 V) - (+0.15 V)\nE°cell = +0.19 V\n\nSince the overall cell potential is positive, the reaction is spontaneous.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) using the following equation:\n\nΔG° = -nFE°cell\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of electrons transferred (in this case, 2), F is Faraday's constant (96,485 C/mol), and E°cell is the overall cell potential.\n\nΔG° = -(2 mol)(96,485 C/mol)(+0.19 V)\nΔG° = -36,644 J/mol\n\nThe standard Gibbs free energy change for this electrochemical cell reaction is -36,644 J/mol."
