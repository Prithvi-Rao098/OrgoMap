    "message_2": "The VSEPR geometry of the molecule CH4 (methane) is tetrahedral. In this molecule, the central carbon atom is bonded to four hydrogen atoms, and there are no lone pairs of electrons on the central atom. According to the VSEPR theory, the repulsion between the electron pairs around the central atom causes them to arrange themselves as far apart as possible, resulting in a tetrahedral geometry with bond angles of approximately 109.5 degrees."
