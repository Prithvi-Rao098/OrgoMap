    "message_1": "Calculate the standard enthalpy change for the vaporization reaction of 25.0 g of water at its boiling point of 100°C using the following information: the molar heat of vaporization of water is 40.7 kJ/mol and the molar mass of water is 18.015 g/mol.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the vaporization reaction of 25.0 g of water, we first need to determine the number of moles of water present. We can do this using the molar mass of water:\n\nmoles of water = mass of water / molar mass of water\nmoles of water = 25.0 g / 18.015 g/mol\nmoles of water ≈ 1.387 moles\n\nNow that we have the number of moles of water, we can use the molar heat of vaporization to calculate the standard enthalpy change:\n\nΔH = moles of water × molar heat of vaporization\nΔH = 1.387 moles × 40.7 kJ/mol\nΔH ≈ 56.4 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the vaporization reaction of 25.0 g of water at its boiling point of 100°C is approximately 56.4 kJ."
