    "message_2": "The balanced chemical equation for the decomposition of potassium chlorate (KClO3) when heated is:\n\n2 KClO3(s) → 2 KCl(s) + 3 O2(g)\n\nTo calculate the amount of oxygen produced from the decomposition of 50 grams of potassium chlorate, we will use stoichiometry.\n\nFirst, we need to find the molar mass of KClO3:\nK = 39.10 g/mol\nCl = 35.45 g/mol\nO = 16.00 g/mol\n\nMolar mass of KClO3 = 39.10 + 35.45 + (3 × 16.00) = 122.55 g/mol\n\nNow, we can convert the mass of KClO3 to moles:\n50 g KClO3 × (1 mol KClO3 / 122.55 g KClO3) = 0.408 moles KClO3\n\nUsing the stoichiometry from the balanced equation, we can find the moles of O2 produced:\n0.408 moles KClO3 × (3 moles O2 / 2 moles KClO3) = 0.612 moles O2\n\nFinally, we can convert the moles of O2 to grams:\n0.612 moles O2 × (32.00 g/mol O2) = 19.58 grams O2\n\nSo, the amount of oxygen produced from the decomposition of 50 grams of potassium chlorate is approximately 19.58 grams."
