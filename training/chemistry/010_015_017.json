    "message_1": "Calculate the overpotential of an electrochemical cell where Zinc metal is used as an anode and Copper metal as a cathode. The concentration of Zinc ions in the half-cell is 1 M and Copper ions in the half-cell is 0.1 M. The temperature of the system is 25°C. (Given: Standard Reduction Potentials - Zn²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Zn(s) = -0.76 V and Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu(s) = +0.34 V)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the overpotential of the electrochemical cell, we first need to find the cell potential (E_cell) using the Nernst equation. The Nernst equation is given by:\n\nE_cell = E°_cell - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\n\nwhere:\nE°_cell = standard cell potential\nR = gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\nT = temperature in Kelvin (25°C = 298.15 K)\nn = number of electrons transferred (2 for both Zn and Cu redox reactions)\nF = Faraday's constant (96,485 C/mol)\nQ = reaction quotient\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard cell potential (E°_cell). This can be calculated using the standard reduction potentials given:\n\nE°_cell = E°_cathode - E°_anode\nE°_cell = (+0.34 V) - (-0.76 V)\nE°_cell = 1.10 V\n\nNext, we need to find the reaction quotient (Q). For the given reaction, Q can be calculated as:\n\nQ = [Cu²⁺]/[Zn²⁺]\n\nNow, we can plug in the given concentrations:\n\nQ = (0.1 M)/(1 M)\nQ = 0.1\n\nNow, we can use the Nernst equation to find the cell potential (E_cell):\n\nE_cell = 1.10 V - (8.314 J/mol·K * 298.15 K) / (2 * 96,485 C/mol) * ln(0.1)\nE_cell = 1.10 V - (0.0257 V) * ln(0.1)\nE_cell ≈ 1.10 V - (-0.0592 V)\nE_cell ≈ 1.1592 V\n\nFinally, we can calculate the overpotential by subtracting the standard cell potential from the cell potential:\n\nOverpotential = E_cell - E°_cell\nOverpotential = 1.1592 V - 1.10 V\nOverpotential ≈ 0.0592 V"
