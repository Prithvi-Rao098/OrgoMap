    "message_2": "The synthesis of ibuprofen from 2-methylpropylbenzene and carbon dioxide using a cobalt catalyst involves several steps. Here is a step-wise mechanism for this process:\n\n1. Hydroformylation: In the presence of a cobalt catalyst, 2-methylpropylbenzene undergoes hydroformylation, which involves the addition of a hydrogen atom and a formyl group (CHO) to the double bond. This reaction produces 2-methyl-4-(1-hydroxyethyl)benzaldehyde.\n\n2. Oxidation: The 2-methyl-4-(1-hydroxyethyl)benzaldehyde is then oxidized to form 2-methyl-4-(1-carboxyethyl)benzoic acid. This step can be carried out using an oxidizing agent such as potassium permanganate (KMnO4) or sodium dichromate (Na2Cr2O7).\n\n3. Friedel-Crafts Acylation: The 2-methyl-4-(1-carboxyethyl)benzoic acid undergoes Friedel-Crafts acylation with acetyl chloride (CH3COCl) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, such as aluminum chloride (AlCl3). This reaction results in the formation of 2-methyl-4-(1-acetoxyethyl)benzoic acid.\n\n4. Decarboxylation: The 2-methyl-4-(1-acetoxyethyl)benzoic acid undergoes decarboxylation, which involves the loss of a carbon dioxide molecule (CO2) to form 2-methyl-4-(1-acetoxyethyl)benzene.\n\n5. Hydrolysis: The 2-methyl-4-(1-acetoxyethyl)benzene is then hydrolyzed to form ibuprofen. This step can be carried out using a strong base such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n\nIn summary, the synthesis of ibuprofen from 2-methylpropylbenzene and carbon dioxide using a cobalt catalyst involves hydroformylation, oxidation, Friedel-Crafts acylation, decarboxylation, and hydrolysis."
