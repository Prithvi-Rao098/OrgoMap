    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction, we need to know the equilibrium concentrations of all the species involved. However, the problem only provides the initial concentrations. Therefore, we need to set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the equilibrium concentrations.\n\nReaction: N2(g) + O2(g) ⇌ 2NO(g)\n\nICE table:\nInitial: [N2] = 0.100 M, [O2] = 0.050 M, [NO] = 0.000 M\nChange: [N2] = -x, [O2] = -x, [NO] = +2x\nEquilibrium: [N2] = 0.100 - x, [O2] = 0.050 - x, [NO] = 2x\n\nThe equilibrium constant expression for the reaction is:\n\nKc = [NO]^2 / ([N2] * [O2])\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot calculate the equilibrium constant Kc without knowing the value of x, which requires additional information such as the Kc value or the equilibrium concentrations. If you have this information, you can plug it into the expression and solve for Kc."
