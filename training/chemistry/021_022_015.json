    "message_2": "To calculate the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid (CH3COOH), we need to determine the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in the solution. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it does not fully dissociate in water. Instead, it establishes an equilibrium with its conjugate base, the acetate ion (CH3COO-), and H+ ions:\n\nCH3COOH (aq) ⇌ CH3COO- (aq) + H+ (aq)\n\nTo determine the concentration of H+ ions, we can use the acid dissociation constant (Ka) for acetic acid. The Ka value for acetic acid is 1.8 x 10^-5. The Ka expression for this equilibrium is:\n\nKa = [CH3COO-][H+] / [CH3COOH]\n\nSince the initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.1 M, we can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the equilibrium concentrations of all species:\n\n          CH3COOH  ⇌  CH3COO-  +  H+\nInitial:   0.1 M        0 M         0 M\nChange:   -x           +x          +x\nEquilibrium: 0.1-x M     x M         x M\n\nNow, we can plug these equilibrium concentrations into the Ka expression:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 = (x)(x) / (0.1 - x)\n\nTo simplify the calculation, we can assume that x is much smaller than 0.1, so 0.1 - x ≈ 0.1:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 = x^2 / 0.1\n\nNow, solve for x (the concentration of H+ ions):\n\nx^2 = 1.8 x 10^-5 * 0.1\nx^2 = 1.8 x 10^-6\nx = √(1.8 x 10^-6)\nx ≈ 1.34 x 10^-3 M\n\nNow that we have the concentration of H+ ions, we can calculate the pH using the pH formula:\n\npH = -log10[H+]\n\npH = -log10(1.34 x 10^-3)\npH ≈ 2.87\n\nSo, the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid is approximately 2.87."
