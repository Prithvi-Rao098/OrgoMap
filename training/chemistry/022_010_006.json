    "message_2": "The balanced chemical equation for the precipitation reaction of lead nitrate (Pb(NO3)2) and potassium iodide (KI) is:\n\nPb(NO3)2 (aq) + 2 KI (aq) â†’ PbI2 (s) + 2 KNO3 (aq)\n\nThe product formed is lead iodide (PbI2), which is a yellow precipitate.\n\nTo determine how much of this product would be produced from 25 grams of each reactant, we need to perform stoichiometric calculations.\n\nFirst, we need to find the molar mass of each reactant and product:\n\nPb(NO3)2: 207.2 (Pb) + 2 * (14.01 (N) + 3 * 16.00 (O)) = 331.21 g/mol\nKI: 39.10 (K) + 126.90 (I) = 166.00 g/mol\nPbI2: 207.2 (Pb) + 2 * 126.90 (I) = 460.99 g/mol\n\nNext, we need to convert the mass of each reactant to moles:\n\nmoles of Pb(NO3)2 = 25 g / 331.21 g/mol = 0.0755 mol\nmoles of KI = 25 g / 166.00 g/mol = 0.1506 mol\n\nNow, we need to determine the limiting reactant:\n\nPb(NO3)2 to KI mole ratio = 1:2\n0.0755 mol Pb(NO3)2 * (2 mol KI / 1 mol Pb(NO3)2) = 0.151 mol KI required\n\nSince we have 0.1506 mol of KI, KI is the limiting reactant.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the moles of PbI2 produced and convert it to grams:\n\nmoles of PbI2 produced = 0.1506 mol KI * (1 mol PbI2 / 2 mol KI) = 0.0753 mol\nmass of PbI2 produced = 0.0753 mol * 460.99 g/mol = 34.71 g\n\nSo, 34.71 grams of lead iodide (PbI2) would be produced from 25 grams of each reactant."
