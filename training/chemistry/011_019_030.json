    "message_2": "To evaluate the adsorption properties of zeolite X and zeolite Y for the removal of methanol from water using computational methods, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Model the zeolite structures: Create a computational model of zeolite X and zeolite Y using crystallographic data available in the literature or databases like the International Zeolite Association (IZA) database. The models should include the atomic positions, unit cell parameters, and the framework topology.\n\n2. Model the adsorbate: Create a computational model of methanol, including its molecular structure and partial charges.\n\n3. Perform molecular simulations: Perform molecular simulations, such as Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) or Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, to study the adsorption of methanol in zeolite X and zeolite Y. These simulations will provide insights into the adsorption isotherms, adsorption sites, and diffusion pathways.\n\n4. Calculate adsorption properties: From the simulation results, calculate the adsorption properties, such as adsorption capacity, adsorption energy, and selectivity. These properties will help in comparing the performance of zeolite X and zeolite Y for methanol removal from water.\n\n5. Analyze the results: Compare the adsorption properties of zeolite X and zeolite Y and determine which zeolite shows better adsorption efficiency. Investigate the reasons behind the difference in performance, such as pore size, pore volume, and framework topology.\n\nBased on the results of the computational study, the zeolite with higher adsorption capacity, higher adsorption energy, and higher selectivity for methanol over water will be considered as the better adsorbent for methanol removal from water. The reasons behind the better performance could be attributed to the specific characteristics of the zeolite, such as its pore size, pore volume, and framework topology, which might provide better interaction with methanol molecules and facilitate their adsorption and diffusion."
