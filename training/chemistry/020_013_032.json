    "message_2": "The ionization of acetic acid (CH3COOH) in water can be represented by the following chemical equation:\n\nCH3COOH (aq) + H2O (l) ⇌ CH3COO- (aq) + H3O+ (aq)\n\nThe equilibrium constant expression for this reaction is given by:\n\nKa = [CH3COO-][H3O+] / [CH3COOH]\n\nGiven that the pH of a 0.1 M acetic acid solution is 4.90, we can determine the concentration of H3O+ ions:\n\npH = -log[H3O+]\n4.90 = -log[H3O+]\n\nSolving for [H3O+]:\n\n[H3O+] = 10^(-4.90) ≈ 1.26 x 10^(-5) M\n\nSince the ionization of acetic acid produces equal amounts of CH3COO- and H3O+ ions, the concentration of CH3COO- ions is also 1.26 x 10^(-5) M.\n\nNow, we can determine the concentration of CH3COOH at equilibrium. Initially, we had a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid. After ionization, the concentration of CH3COOH decreases by the amount of H3O+ ions formed:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.1 M - 1.26 x 10^(-5) M ≈ 0.1 M\n\nNow we can plug these concentrations into the Ka expression:\n\nKa = [(1.26 x 10^(-5)) (1.26 x 10^(-5))] / [0.1]\nKa ≈ 1.58 x 10^(-10)\n\nThe equilibrium constant (Ka) for the ionization of acetic acid in water at 25°C is approximately 1.58 x 10^(-10)."
