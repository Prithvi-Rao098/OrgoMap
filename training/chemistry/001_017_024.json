    "message_2": "In methanol (CH3OH), the oxidation state of carbon can be determined by assigning oxidation numbers to each atom in the molecule.\n\n1. Hydrogen has an oxidation state of +1.\n2. Oxygen has an oxidation state of -2.\n\nNow, let's assign the oxidation numbers to the atoms in methanol:\n\nC: x (unknown oxidation state of carbon)\nH3: 3 * (+1) = +3 (since there are three hydrogen atoms)\nO: -2 (oxidation state of oxygen)\nH: +1 (oxidation state of hydrogen)\n\nThe sum of the oxidation numbers in a neutral molecule should be equal to zero. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\nx + 3(+1) + (-2) + (+1) = 0\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx + 3 - 2 + 1 = 0\nx + 2 = 0\nx = -2\n\nThe oxidation state of carbon in methanol (CH3OH) is -2."
