    "message_1": "A chemistry student wants to determine the specific heat capacity of a metal sample. The student adds 50 g of the metal sample to 200 g of water at 25°C in a calorimeter. The temperature of the water rises from 25°C to 38°C. Assume the specific heat capacity of water is 4.184 J/g°C. What is the specific heat capacity of the metal sample?",
    "message_2": "To determine the specific heat capacity of the metal sample, we can use the formula for heat transfer:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat transferred, m is the mass, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nFirst, we need to find the heat gained by the water:\n\nq_water = m_water * c_water * ΔT_water\n\nq_water = (200 g) * (4.184 J/g°C) * (38°C - 25°C)\nq_water = 200 * 4.184 * 13\nq_water = 10879.2 J\n\nSince the metal sample loses heat to the water, the heat gained by the water is equal to the heat lost by the metal:\n\nq_metal = -q_water\nq_metal = -10879.2 J\n\nNow we can use the heat transfer formula to find the specific heat capacity of the metal:\n\nq_metal = m_metal * c_metal * ΔT_metal\n\n-10879.2 J = (50 g) * c_metal * (25°C - 38°C)\n\n-10879.2 J = 50 * c_metal * (-13°C)\n\nNow, we can solve for c_metal:\n\nc_metal = -10879.2 J / (50 g * -13°C)\nc_metal = 10879.2 / 650\nc_metal ≈ 16.74 J/g°C\n\nThe specific heat capacity of the metal sample is approximately 16.74 J/g°C."
