    "message_1": "How does changing the temperature affect the equilibrium constant of the following reaction? \n\n2NO2(g) ⇌   N2O4(g)\n\nIf the equilibrium constant (Kc) for this reaction at 25°C is 4.6 x 10^-3, what will be the new value of Kc if the reaction is carried out at 35°C?",
    "message_2": "To determine the new value of Kc at 35°C, we need to use the Van't Hoff equation, which relates the change in temperature to the change in the equilibrium constant:\n\nln(K2/K1) = -ΔH°/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere K1 and K2 are the equilibrium constants at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively, ΔH° is the standard enthalpy change of the reaction, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), and T1 and T2 are the temperatures in Kelvin.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin:\nT1 = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\nT2 = 35°C + 273.15 = 308.15 K\n\nNext, we need the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the reaction. For the reaction 2NO2(g) ⇌ N2O4(g), the standard enthalpy change is approximately -57.2 kJ/mol.\n\nNow we can plug the values into the Van't Hoff equation:\n\nln(K2/(4.6 x 10^-3)) = -(-57,200 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K) * (1/308.15 K - 1/298.15 K)\n\nSolving for K2:\n\nln(K2/(4.6 x 10^-3)) ≈ 1.497\nK2/(4.6 x 10^-3) ≈ 4.47\nK2 ≈ 4.47 * (4.6 x 10^-3)\nK2 ≈ 2.06 x 10^-2\n\nSo, the new value of Kc at 35°C is approximately 2.06 x 10^-2."
