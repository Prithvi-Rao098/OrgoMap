",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard electrode potential of the cell, we need to consider the reduction potentials of both half-cells. The cell reaction can be written as:\n\nAg+ + H2 → Ag + 2H+\n\nThe standard electrode potential of the cell (E°cell) can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nE°cell = E°cathode - E°anode\n\nIn this case, the silver electrode (Ag+/Ag) is the cathode, and the hydrogen electrode (H+/H2) is the anode. The given reduction potentials are:\n\nE°(Ag+/Ag) = +0.80 V\nE°(H+/H2) = 0.00 V\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nE°cell = (+0.80 V) - (0.00 V)\nE°cell = +0.80 V\n\nThe standard electrode potential of the cell is +0.80 V."
