    "message_2": "To calculate the standard electrode potential for the given redox reaction, we need to look up the standard reduction potential for the half-reaction in a table of standard reduction potentials. The half-reaction is:\n\nFe3+ + 3e- → Fe(s)\n\nThe standard reduction potential for this half-reaction is:\n\nE°(Fe3+/Fe) = -0.036 V\n\nSince the given reaction is a reduction process, the standard electrode potential for the redox reaction is the same as the standard reduction potential:\n\nE°(Fe3+/Fe) = -0.036 V"
