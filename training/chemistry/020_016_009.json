    "message_2": "To determine the solubility of silver chloride (AgCl) in a 0.05 M potassium chloride (KCl) solution, we need to consider the common ion effect. The solubility product constant (Ksp) of AgCl is given as 1.8 × 10^-10.\n\nFirst, let's write the balanced chemical equation for the dissolution of AgCl:\n\nAgCl(s) ⇌ Ag⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq)\n\nThe Ksp expression for this reaction is:\n\nKsp = [Ag⁺][Cl⁻]\n\nSince KCl is a strong electrolyte, it will completely dissociate in water:\n\nKCl(aq) → K⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq)\n\nThe concentration of Cl⁻ ions from KCl is 0.05 M.\n\nLet x be the solubility of AgCl in moles per liter. When AgCl dissolves, it will produce x moles of Ag⁺ ions and x moles of Cl⁻ ions. However, we already have 0.05 M Cl⁻ ions from KCl. Therefore, the total concentration of Cl⁻ ions in the solution will be (x + 0.05) M.\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the Ksp expression:\n\nKsp = [Ag⁺][Cl⁻] = (x)(x + 0.05)\n\nGiven that Ksp = 1.8 × 10^-10:\n\n1.8 × 10^-10 = x(x + 0.05)\n\nSince the Ksp value is very small, we can assume that x is also very small compared to 0.05. Therefore, we can approximate (x + 0.05) as 0.05:\n\n1.8 × 10^-10 ≈ x(0.05)\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx ≈ (1.8 × 10^-10) / 0.05\nx ≈ 3.6 × 10^-9 M\n\nThe solubility of AgCl in 0.05 M KCl solution is approximately 3.6 × 10^-9 M. Since x also represents the concentration of Ag⁺ ions in the solution, the concentration of silver ions is also approximately 3.6 × 10^-9 M."
