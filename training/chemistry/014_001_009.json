    "message_2": "The synthesis procedure of the coordination compound [NiCl2(PPh3)2] involves the reaction of nickel(II) chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2·6H2O) with triphenylphosphine (PPh3) in an appropriate solvent, such as ethanol or methanol. Here is a general procedure for the synthesis:\n\n1. Dissolve an appropriate amount of NiCl2·6H2O (e.g., 1 mmol) in a minimum amount of ethanol or methanol in a round-bottom flask.\n\n2. Add an excess of triphenylphosphine (PPh3) to the solution (e.g., 2.2 mmol) to ensure complete coordination.\n\n3. Stir the mixture at room temperature for several hours or until the reaction is complete. The solution should turn from green to a dark red or brown color, indicating the formation of [NiCl2(PPh3)2].\n\n4. Remove the solvent by evaporation or under reduced pressure to obtain the crude product as a dark red or brown solid.\n\n5. Recrystallize the crude product from a suitable solvent, such as dichloromethane/hexane or ethanol, to obtain pure [NiCl2(PPh3)2] as dark red or brown crystals.\n\nTo determine the purity of the synthesized [NiCl2(PPh3)2], various spectroscopic techniques can be employed:\n\n1. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy: The IR spectrum of the compound should show characteristic bands for PPh3 ligands, such as P-C stretching vibrations around 1000-1100 cm-1 and aromatic C-H stretching vibrations around 3000-3100 cm-1. The absence of any unreacted starting material peaks will indicate the purity of the compound.\n\n2. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy: The 1H NMR and 31P NMR spectra can provide information about the coordination environment of the ligands. In the 1H NMR spectrum, the aromatic protons of PPh3 should appear as multiplets around 7-8 ppm, while the 31P NMR spectrum should show a single peak for the coordinated PPh3 ligands. The absence of any unreacted starting material peaks will indicate the purity of the compound.\n\n3. UV-Visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy: The UV-Vis spectrum of [NiCl2(PPh3)2] should show a characteristic absorption band around 450-500 nm, corresponding to the d-d transition of the Ni(II) ion. The absence of any unreacted starting material peaks will indicate the purity of the compound.\n\n4. Elemental analysis or Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) analysis can be used to determine the metal content and confirm the stoichiometry of the compound.\n\n5. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) can be used to determine the crystal structure of the compound and confirm its purity and identity."
