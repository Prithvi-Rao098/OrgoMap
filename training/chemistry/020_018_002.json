    "message_1": "Consider the reaction: \nCu^2+ + 4NH3 ⇌ [Cu(NH3)4]^2+ \n\nIf the initial concentration of Cu^2+ is 0.5 M and the initial concentration of NH3 is 2 M, what is the concentration of [Cu(NH3)4]^2+ at equilibrium if the concentration of NH3 is increased to 5 M? (Assume the volume of the solution remains constant and the temperature is kept constant.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the reaction quotient (Q) and the equilibrium constant (K) for the reaction. \n\nFirst, we need to find the equilibrium constant (K) using the initial concentrations of Cu^2+ and NH3. We can write the expression for K as:\n\nK = [Cu(NH3)4]^2+ / ([Cu^2+][NH3]^4)\n\nLet x be the change in concentration of Cu^2+ and NH3 at equilibrium. Then, the equilibrium concentrations will be:\n\n[Cu^2+] = 0.5 M - x\n[NH3] = 2 M - 4x\n[Cu(NH3)4]^2+ = x\n\nNow, we can substitute these equilibrium concentrations into the K expression:\n\nK = x / ((0.5 - x)(2 - 4x)^4)\n\nNow, let's consider the new situation where the concentration of NH3 is increased to 5 M. We need to find the new equilibrium concentrations of the species. Let y be the change in concentration of Cu^2+ and NH3 at the new equilibrium. Then, the new equilibrium concentrations will be:\n\n[Cu^2+] = 0.5 M - y\n[NH3] = 5 M - 4y\n[Cu(NH3)4]^2+ = y\n\nSince the temperature is constant, K remains the same. We can write the new equilibrium expression as:\n\nK = y / ((0.5 - y)(5 - 4y)^4)\n\nNow, we have two equations for K:\n\nx / ((0.5 - x)(2 - 4x)^4) = y / ((0.5 - y)(5 - 4y)^4)\n\nSince we are interested in finding the concentration of [Cu(NH3)4]^2+ at the new equilibrium, we want to solve for y. However, this is a complex equation, and it is difficult to solve for y directly. Instead, we can use an approximation.\n\nSince the initial concentration of NH3 is much higher than that of Cu^2+, we can assume that the change in concentration of NH3 (4x or 4y) is relatively small compared to the initial concentration of NH3. Therefore, we can approximate the equilibrium expressions as:\n\nK ≈ x / (0.5 * 2^4) = y / (0.5 * 5^4)\n\nNow, we can solve for y:\n\ny = x * (0.5 * 5^4) / (0.5 * 2^4)\n\nSince we are given the initial concentrations, we can find x using the initial K expression:\n\nx = K * (0.5 * 2^4)\n\nNow, substitute x back into the equation for y:\n\ny = (K * (0.5 * 2^4)) * (0.5 * 5^4) / (0.5 * 2^4)\n\ny = K * (0.5 * 5^4)\n\nThe concentration of [Cu(NH3)4]^2+ at the new equilibrium (y) depends on the value of K. Unfortunately, we cannot determine the exact value of K without more information. However, this equation shows the relationship between K and the concentration of [Cu(NH3)4]^2+ at the new equilibrium."
