    "message_2": "When ethanol (CH3CH2OH) reacts with a carboxylic acid (RCOOH) in the presence of a mineral acid catalyst (such as sulfuric acid, H2SO4), an esterification reaction occurs. The product formed is an ester (RCOOR') and water (H2O).\n\nThe mechanism of the reaction is as follows:\n\n1. Protonation of the carbonyl oxygen in the carboxylic acid by the mineral acid catalyst.\nRCOOH + H+ → RCOOH2+\n\n2. Nucleophilic attack of the alcohol oxygen on the carbonyl carbon of the protonated carboxylic acid.\nRCOOH2+ + CH3CH2OH → RCOOCH2CH3 + H2O\n\n3. Deprotonation of the oxonium ion intermediate by the alcohol or another carboxylic acid molecule.\nRCOOCH2CH3 + H2O → RCOOCH2CH3 + H3O+\n\nThe overall reaction is:\nRCOOH + CH3CH2OH → RCOOCH2CH3 + H2O\n\nThe functional group present in the ester product is the ester group, which has the general structure -COOR' (where R' is an alkyl group). In this case, the ester group is -COOCH2CH3."
