The molar mass of sucrose is 342.3 g/mol.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 2 moles of sucrose, we can use the formula:\n\nΔH = mcΔT\n\nwhere ΔH is the enthalpy change, m is the mass of the solution, c is the heat capacity of the solution, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nFirst, let's find the mass of 2 moles of sucrose:\n\nmass = moles × molar mass\nmass = 2 moles × 342.3 g/mol\nmass = 684.6 g\n\nNow, let's find the change in temperature:\n\nΔT = T_final - T_initial\nΔT = 28.0°C - 22.0°C\nΔT = 6.0°C\n\nNow we can calculate the enthalpy change:\n\nΔH = mcΔT\nΔH = (684.6 g)(4.18 J/g.K)(6.0°C)\nΔH = 17116.968 J\n\nSince the enthalpy change is positive, the reaction is endothermic. The enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 2 moles of sucrose in aqueous solution is 17,116.968 J or 17.12 kJ (rounded to two decimal places)."
