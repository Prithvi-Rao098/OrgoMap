    "message_1": "What mass of silver (Ag) will be deposited on a cathode when a current of 5 A is passed through a solution of silver nitrate (AgNO₃) for 10 minutes? The atomic weight of silver is 107.87 g/mol and the Faraday constant is 96,500 C/mol. (Assuming 100% current efficiency and neglecting the mass of the electrodes.)",
    "message_2": "To find the mass of silver deposited on the cathode, we can use the following formula:\n\nmass = (current × time × atomic weight) / (n × Faraday constant)\n\nwhere:\n- mass is the mass of silver deposited (in grams)\n- current is the current passed through the solution (in Amperes)\n- time is the duration of the current flow (in seconds)\n- atomic weight is the atomic weight of silver (in g/mol)\n- n is the number of electrons involved in the redox reaction (for silver, n = 1)\n- Faraday constant is the charge per mole of electrons (in C/mol)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the time from minutes to seconds:\n\n10 minutes × 60 seconds/minute = 600 seconds\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nmass = (5 A × 600 s × 107.87 g/mol) / (1 × 96,500 C/mol)\n\nmass = (3,000 A·s × 107.87 g/mol) / 96,500 C/mol\n\nmass ≈ 33.42 g\n\nTherefore, approximately 33.42 grams of silver will be deposited on the cathode."
