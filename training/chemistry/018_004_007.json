    "message_2": "To calculate the activation energy (Ea) of a reaction, we can use the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk = A * e^(-Ea / R * T)\n\nwhere k is the rate constant, A is the pre-exponential factor, Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol*K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nWe have two sets of data: k1 = 8.23 x 10^-4 s^-1 at T1 = 300 K and k2 = 1.56 x 10^-2 s^-1 at T2 = 350 K. We can set up two equations using the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk1 = A * e^(-Ea / R * T1)\nk2 = A * e^(-Ea / R * T2)\n\nNow, we can divide the first equation by the second equation to eliminate the pre-exponential factor (A):\n\nk1 / k2 = e^(-Ea / R * T1) / e^(-Ea / R * T2)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n(k1 / k2) = e^((-Ea / R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2))\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(k1 / k2) = (-Ea / R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2)\n\nNow, we can solve for Ea:\n\nEa = -R * ln(k1 / k2) / (1/T1 - 1/T2)\n\nPlug in the given values:\n\nEa = -8.314 J/mol*K * ln((8.23 x 10^-4 s^-1) / (1.56 x 10^-2 s^-1)) / (1/300 K - 1/350 K)\n\nEa â‰ˆ 49050 J/mol\n\nThe activation energy of the reaction is approximately 49.05 kJ/mol."
