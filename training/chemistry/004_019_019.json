    "message_2": "To find the concentration of iron(II) sulfate in the solution, we can use the Beer-Lambert Law:\n\nA = ε * c * l\n\nwhere A is the absorbance (0.45), ε is the molar extinction coefficient (7,590 M^-1cm^-1), c is the concentration of the solution (which we want to find), and l is the path length of the cuvette (usually 1 cm).\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for c:\n\nc = A / (ε * l)\n\nNow, plug in the given values:\n\nc = 0.45 / (7,590 M^-1cm^-1 * 1 cm)\n\nc = 0.0000593 M\n\nThe concentration of iron(II) sulfate in the 20 mL sample solution is 0.0000593 M (or 59.3 µM)."
