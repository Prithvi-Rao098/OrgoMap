    "message_2": "To calculate the heat generated in the complete combustion of 1 mole of methane gas (CH4), we need to consider the balanced chemical equation for the combustion reaction:\n\nCH4 (g) + 2 O2 (g) → CO2 (g) + 2 H2O (l)\n\nNow, we need to find the standard enthalpy of formation for water (H2O). The standard enthalpy of formation of H2O (l) is -285.8 kJ/mol.\n\nNext, we will use Hess's Law to calculate the heat generated (ΔH) in the reaction:\n\nΔH = [Σ (moles of products × standard enthalpy of formation of products)] - [Σ (moles of reactants × standard enthalpy of formation of reactants)]\n\nΔH = [(1 × -393.5) + (2 × -285.8)] - [(1 × -74.8) + (2 × 0)]\n\nNote that the standard enthalpy of formation for O2 is 0 because it is in its elemental form.\n\nΔH = (-393.5 - 571.6) - (-74.8)\n\nΔH = -965.1 + 74.8\n\nΔH = -890.3 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the amount of heat generated in the complete combustion of 1 mole of methane gas (CH4) at constant pressure is -890.3 kJ/mol. The negative sign indicates that the reaction is exothermic, meaning heat is released during the combustion process."
