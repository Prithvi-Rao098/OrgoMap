    "message_2": "In the compound KMnO4 (potassium permanganate), the oxidation states of each element are as follows:\n\n1. Potassium (K): The oxidation state of potassium in its compounds is always +1. So, in KMnO4, the oxidation state of K is +1.\n\n2. Manganese (Mn): To determine the oxidation state of manganese, we need to consider the overall charge of the compound and the oxidation states of the other elements. Since KMnO4 is a neutral compound, the sum of the oxidation states of all elements must be equal to zero.\n\n3. Oxygen (O): The oxidation state of oxygen in its compounds is usually -2 (except in peroxides, where it is -1, and in OF2, where it is +2). In KMnO4, the oxidation state of each oxygen atom is -2.\n\nNow, let's calculate the oxidation state of manganese (Mn) using the information above:\n\nLet x be the oxidation state of Mn. We have 1 potassium atom, 1 manganese atom, and 4 oxygen atoms in the compound. So, the equation for the sum of the oxidation states is:\n\n(+1) + x + 4(-2) = 0\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx - 7 = 0\nx = +7\n\nTherefore, the oxidation state of manganese (Mn) in KMnO4 is +7.\n\nIn summary, the oxidation states of each element in KMnO4 are:\n- Potassium (K): +1\n- Manganese (Mn): +7\n- Oxygen (O): -2"
