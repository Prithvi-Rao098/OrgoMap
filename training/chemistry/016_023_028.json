    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change of hydrolysis for 10 grams of sucrose, we first need to determine the number of moles of sucrose present. \n\nThe molecular weight of sucrose (C12H22O11) is:\n(12 x 12.01) + (22 x 1.01) + (11 x 16.00) = 144.12 + 22.22 + 176.00 = 342.34 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the number of moles of sucrose in 10 grams:\nmoles = mass / molecular weight\nmoles = 10 g / 342.34 g/mol = 0.0292 mol\n\nThe enthalpy of hydrolysis for sucrose is given as -564.8 kJ/mol. To find the enthalpy change for the 10 grams of sucrose, we multiply the number of moles by the enthalpy of hydrolysis:\n\nΔH = moles x enthalpy of hydrolysis\nΔH = 0.0292 mol x (-564.8 kJ/mol) = -16.48 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change of hydrolysis for 10 grams of sucrose dissolved in 100 mL of water at 25°C is approximately -16.48 kJ."
