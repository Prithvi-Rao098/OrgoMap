    "message_2": "To calculate the pH of a 0.1 M solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl), we need to know the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in the solution. HCl is a strong acid, which means it completely dissociates in water to form H+ and Cl- ions. Therefore, the concentration of H+ ions in the solution will be equal to the concentration of HCl.\n\nIn this case, the concentration of H+ ions is 0.1 M. The pH of a solution is calculated using the formula:\n\npH = -log10[H+]\n\nwhere [H+] is the concentration of hydrogen ions in moles per liter (M).\n\nPlugging in the given concentration:\n\npH = -log10(0.1)\npH = -(-1)\npH = 1\n\nThe pH of a 0.1 M solution of hydrochloric acid is 1."
