    "message_2": "To calculate the efficiency of an electrochemical cell, we need to compare the actual output energy to the theoretical maximum energy output. First, we need to find the actual output energy and the theoretical maximum energy output.\n\nActual output energy (E_actual) can be calculated using the formula:\nE_actual = V_actual * I * t\n\nwhere V_actual is the measured potential (1.2V), I is the current (0.5A), and t is the time in seconds (2 hours * 3600 seconds/hour = 7200 seconds).\n\nE_actual = 1.2V * 0.5A * 7200s = 4320 Joules\n\nThe theoretical maximum energy output (E_theoretical) can be calculated using the formula:\nE_theoretical = V_theoretical * I * t\n\nwhere V_theoretical is the standard potential (1.5V), I is the current (0.5A), and t is the time in seconds (7200 seconds).\n\nE_theoretical = 1.5V * 0.5A * 7200s = 5400 Joules\n\nNow, we can calculate the efficiency of the electrochemical cell using the formula:\nEfficiency = (E_actual / E_theoretical) * 100%\n\nEfficiency = (4320 Joules / 5400 Joules) * 100% = 0.8 * 100% = 80%\n\nThe efficiency of the electrochemical cell is 80%."
