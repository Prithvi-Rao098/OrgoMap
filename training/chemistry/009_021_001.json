    "message_2": "Radiation therapy, also known as radiotherapy, is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy particles or waves, such as x-rays, gamma rays, electron beams, or protons, to destroy or damage cancer cells. The mechanism of action behind radiation therapy primarily involves the induction of DNA damage in cancer cells, which leads to cell death or the inhibition of cell proliferation.\n\nThe main types of DNA damage caused by radiation therapy are:\n\n1. Direct DNA damage: High-energy radiation directly ionizes the DNA molecule, causing breaks in the DNA strands. This can lead to single-strand breaks (SSBs) or double-strand breaks (DSBs). DSBs are more lethal to cells, as they are harder to repair and can lead to chromosomal aberrations, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis (programmed cell death).\n\n2. Indirect DNA damage: Radiation therapy can also cause the ionization of water molecules within cells, producing highly reactive free radicals, such as hydroxyl radicals (OHâ€¢). These free radicals can react with DNA, causing damage to the DNA structure, including base modifications, cross-linking, and strand breaks.\n\nCancer cells are generally more sensitive to radiation therapy than normal cells due to their rapid proliferation and impaired DNA repair mechanisms. However, normal cells surrounding the tumor can also be affected, leading to side effects.\n\nRadiation therapy differs from other cancer treatments in several ways:\n\n1. Mode of action: While radiation therapy primarily targets DNA damage to kill cancer cells, other treatments like chemotherapy use drugs that interfere with various aspects of cell division and growth. Immunotherapy, on the other hand, harnesses the patient's immune system to target and destroy cancer cells.\n\n2. Localized treatment: Radiation therapy is typically a localized treatment, meaning it is directed at a specific area of the body where the tumor is located. This is in contrast to systemic treatments like chemotherapy and immunotherapy, which circulate throughout the entire body.\n\n3. Combination with other treatments: Radiation therapy can be used alone or in combination with other treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy. The choice of treatment depends on the type, stage, and location of the cancer, as well as the patient's overall health.\n\n4. Treatment schedule: Radiation therapy is usually administered in multiple sessions over several weeks, allowing for the recovery of normal cells between treatments. Chemotherapy and immunotherapy may have different treatment schedules, depending on the specific drugs and protocols used.\n\nIn summary, radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that primarily works by inducing DNA damage in cancer cells, leading to cell death or inhibition of cell proliferation. It differs from other cancer treatments in its mode of action, localization, combination with other treatments, and treatment schedule."
