    "message_2": "Sodium chloride (NaCl) has ionic bonding, diamond (C) has covalent bonding, and copper (Cu) has metallic bonding. The differences in their physical properties are due to the nature of these bonds.\n\n1. Ionic bonding in Sodium chloride (NaCl):\nIn NaCl, the bonding occurs between a metal (sodium) and a non-metal (chlorine). Sodium loses an electron to become a positively charged ion (Na+), while chlorine gains an electron to become a negatively charged ion (Cl-). The electrostatic attraction between these oppositely charged ions forms an ionic bond. Due to the strong ionic bonds, NaCl has a high melting and boiling point, is hard and brittle in its solid form, and dissolves easily in water. It also conducts electricity when dissolved in water or in a molten state, as the ions are free to move and carry charge.\n\n2. Covalent bonding in Diamond (C):\nIn diamond, each carbon atom is bonded to four other carbon atoms through covalent bonds, forming a tetrahedral structure. Covalent bonds involve the sharing of electrons between atoms, in this case, between carbon atoms. This strong covalent bonding results in a rigid, three-dimensional lattice structure, making diamond extremely hard and giving it a very high melting and boiling point. Diamond does not conduct electricity, as there are no free electrons or ions available to carry charge. It is also insoluble in water and most solvents due to its strong covalent network.\n\n3. Metallic bonding in Copper (Cu):\nIn copper, the bonding occurs between metal atoms. Metallic bonding involves the sharing of free electrons among a lattice of positively charged metal ions. The electrons are delocalized and can move freely throughout the metal lattice, forming a \"sea of electrons.\" This type of bonding gives copper its characteristic properties, such as high electrical and thermal conductivity, malleability, and ductility. Copper has a relatively high melting and boiling point due to the strong metallic bonds, but it is lower than that of diamond or NaCl. Copper is also insoluble in water and most solvents."
