    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic moment of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) at room temperature, we can use the formula:\n\nMagnetic moment (μ) = √(n(n+2)) × BM (Bohr magneton)\n\nwhere n is the number of unpaired electrons and BM is the Bohr magneton (9.274 × 10^-24 J/T).\n\nFirst, we need to determine the number of unpaired electrons in Fe2O3. Iron(III) has an oxidation state of +3, meaning it has lost 3 electrons from its 3d and 4s orbitals. The electronic configuration of Fe is [Ar] 3d^6 4s^2, and for Fe(III), it is [Ar] 3d^5. There are 5 unpaired electrons in the 3d orbital.\n\nNow, we can use the formula to calculate the magnetic moment:\n\nμ = √(5(5+2)) × BM\nμ = √(5(7)) × (9.274 × 10^-24 J/T)\nμ = √(35) × (9.274 × 10^-24 J/T)\nμ = 5.92 × (9.274 × 10^-24 J/T)\nμ = 5.48 × 10^-23 J/T\n\nHowever, this is the magnetic moment per iron atom. Since there are two iron atoms in the Fe2O3 molecule, we need to multiply the magnetic moment by 2:\n\nMagnetic moment of Fe2O3 = 2 × 5.48 × 10^-23 J/T\nMagnetic moment of Fe2O3 = 1.096 × 10^-22 J/T\n\nSo, the calculated magnetic moment of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) at room temperature using an experimental molar susceptibility of 5.48 × 10^-6 cm^3/mol is approximately 1.096 × 10^-22 J/T."
