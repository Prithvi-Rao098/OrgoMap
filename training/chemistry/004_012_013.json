    "message_2": "To determine the percentage composition of iron in an iron oxide compound, we need to know the specific compound's formula and its molar mass. Iron oxide compounds can have different formulas, such as FeO (iron (II) oxide), Fe2O3 (iron (III) oxide), or Fe3O4 (magnetite).\n\nLet's assume you are working with Fe2O3 (iron (III) oxide) as an example. First, we need to calculate the molar mass of Fe2O3:\n\nMolar mass of Fe = 55.845 g/mol (from the periodic table)\nMolar mass of O = 16.00 g/mol (from the periodic table)\n\nFe2O3 = (2 × 55.845) + (3 × 16.00) = 111.69 + 48.00 = 159.69 g/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the percentage composition of iron (Fe) in Fe2O3:\n\n% Fe = (mass of Fe in the compound / molar mass of the compound) × 100\n% Fe = (111.69 g/mol / 159.69 g/mol) × 100 = 69.94%\n\nSo, the percentage composition of iron in the iron (III) oxide compound (Fe2O3) is approximately 69.94%."
