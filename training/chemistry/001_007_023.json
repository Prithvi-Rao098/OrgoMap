    "message_2": "The major product formed when benzene is treated with a mixture of sulfuric and nitric acid in the presence of concentrated sulfuric acid as a catalyst is nitrobenzene. This reaction is known as nitration of benzene.\n\nThe reaction mechanism occurs in the following steps:\n\n1. Formation of nitronium ion (NO2+): Concentrated sulfuric acid protonates nitric acid (HNO3) to form nitronium ion (NO2+) and bisulfate ion (HSO4-).\nHNO3 + H2SO4 -> NO2+ + HSO4- + H2O\n\n2. Electrophilic attack on benzene: The nitronium ion (NO2+) acts as an electrophile and attacks the benzene ring, which is rich in electron density due to the delocalized Ï€ electrons. This attack forms a resonance-stabilized carbocation called the sigma complex or arenium ion.\n\n3. Deprotonation: A proton from the sigma complex is removed by the bisulfate ion (HSO4-), which acts as a base, to regenerate the aromaticity of the benzene ring. This step forms nitrobenzene as the major product and sulfuric acid.\n\nOverall, the reaction can be summarized as:\nBenzene + HNO3 -> Nitrobenzene + H2O\n\nThis nitration reaction is an example of electrophilic aromatic substitution, where the nitro group (NO2) substitutes a hydrogen atom on the benzene ring."
