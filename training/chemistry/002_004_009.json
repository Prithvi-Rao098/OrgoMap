    "message_2": "To find the pH of the solution, we first need to determine the concentration of H+ ions after the reaction between HCl and NaOH. HCl is a strong acid and NaOH is a strong base, so they will react in a 1:1 ratio to form water and NaCl.\n\nHCl + NaOH → H2O + NaCl\n\nSince there is 0.1 M HCl and 0.05 M NaOH, the limiting reactant is NaOH. Therefore, 0.05 moles of HCl will react with 0.05 moles of NaOH, leaving 0.05 moles of HCl unreacted.\n\nThe concentration of H+ ions in the solution will be equal to the concentration of unreacted HCl, which is 0.05 M.\n\nNow we can use the pH formula:\n\npH = -log10[H+]\n\npH = -log10(0.05)\n\npH ≈ 1.3\n\nThe pH of the solution is approximately 1.3."
