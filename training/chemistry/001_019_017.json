    "message_2": "When methyl bromide (CH3Br) reacts with aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a nucleophilic substitution reaction occurs. Specifically, it is an SN2 reaction (substitution nucleophilic bimolecular). In this reaction, the hydroxide ion (OH-) from sodium hydroxide acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon in methyl bromide, replacing the bromide ion (Br-).\n\nThe products formed in this reaction are methanol (CH3OH) and sodium bromide (NaBr). The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nCH3Br + NaOH â†’ CH3OH + NaBr"
