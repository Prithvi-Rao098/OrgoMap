    "message_2": "To find the empirical formula, we need to convert the percentages to grams and then to moles.\n\nAssume we have a 100 g sample of the compound. This means we have:\n53.38 g of sulfur (S)\n12.09 g of hydrogen (H)\n34.53 g of oxygen (O)\n\nNow, we'll convert these masses to moles using the molar masses of each element:\nMolar mass of S = 32.07 g/mol\nMolar mass of H = 1.01 g/mol\nMolar mass of O = 16.00 g/mol\n\nMoles of S = 53.38 g / 32.07 g/mol = 1.665 mol\nMoles of H = 12.09 g / 1.01 g/mol = 11.97 mol\nMoles of O = 34.53 g / 16.00 g/mol = 2.158 mol\n\nNow, we'll divide each of these values by the smallest number of moles to get the mole ratio:\nMole ratio of S = 1.665 / 1.665 = 1\nMole ratio of H = 11.97 / 1.665 ≈ 7.2 ≈ 7 (rounded to the nearest whole number)\nMole ratio of O = 2.158 / 1.665 ≈ 1.3 ≈ 1 (rounded to the nearest whole number)\n\nSo, the empirical formula is SH₇O.\n\nNow, let's find the molecular formula. First, we need to determine the molar mass of the empirical formula:\nMolar mass of SH₇O = 32.07 (S) + 7 * 1.01 (H) + 16.00 (O) = 48.14 g/mol\n\nNext, we'll divide the given molar mass of the compound (84.14 g/mol) by the molar mass of the empirical formula (48.14 g/mol) to find the ratio between them:\nRatio = 84.14 g/mol / 48.14 g/mol ≈ 1.75 ≈ 2 (rounded to the nearest whole number)\n\nFinally, we'll multiply the empirical formula by this ratio to get the molecular formula:\nMolecular formula = 2(SH₇O) = S₂H₁₄O₂"
