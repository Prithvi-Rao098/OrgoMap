    "message_2": "A compound that exhibits a characteristic NMR signal at 1.2 ppm with an integration of 3 and a splitting pattern of a quartet is likely to be an ethyl group (CH2CH3) attached to a carbon atom. The 1.2 ppm signal corresponds to the methylene protons (CH2) of the ethyl group. The integration of 3 indicates that there are three equivalent protons contributing to the signal, which is consistent with a methylene group. The splitting pattern of a quartet suggests that the methylene protons are adjacent to a carbon atom with three protons (CH3), which is the methyl group of the ethyl group.\n\nThe chemical structure of this compound could be a simple ethyl group attached to a carbon atom, such as in ethanol (CH3CH2OH), ethyl acetate (CH3COOCH2CH3), or other compounds containing an ethyl group. However, without more information about the compound's other NMR signals or its chemical formula, it is not possible to determine the exact chemical structure."
