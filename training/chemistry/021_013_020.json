    "message_2": "The Lewis structure of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) can be drawn as follows:\n\n1. First, count the total number of valence electrons. Carbon has 4 valence electrons and each chlorine atom has 7 valence electrons. Since there are 4 chlorine atoms, the total number of valence electrons is 4 + (4 × 7) = 4 + 28 = 32.\n\n2. Place the central atom (carbon) in the center and arrange the 4 chlorine atoms around it.\n\n3. Connect the central atom to each surrounding atom with a single bond. This will use up 8 valence electrons (4 single bonds × 2 electrons per bond = 8 electrons).\n\n4. Distribute the remaining valence electrons (32 - 8 = 24) as lone pairs around the surrounding atoms (chlorine) to satisfy the octet rule. Each chlorine atom needs 6 more electrons to complete its octet, so each chlorine will have 3 lone pairs.\n\nThe Lewis structure of CCl4 is:\n\n         Cl\n          |\n    Cl - C - Cl\n          |\n         Cl\n\nEach chlorine atom is single-bonded to the central carbon atom, and each chlorine atom has 3 lone pairs of electrons. The central carbon atom has no lone pairs and is surrounded by 4 single bonds."
