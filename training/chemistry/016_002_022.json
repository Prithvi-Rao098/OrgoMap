    "message_2": "To use Hess's Law, we need to manipulate the given reactions so that they add up to the combustion reaction of methane gas (CH₄). The target reaction is:\n\nCH₄ (g) + 2O₂ (g) → CO₂ (g) + 2H₂O (l)\n\nReaction 1 is already the target reaction, so we don't need to manipulate it. The enthalpy change for the combustion reaction of methane gas is the same as the enthalpy change for Reaction 1:\n\n∆H = -891 kJ/mol"
