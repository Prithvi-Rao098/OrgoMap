    "message_2": "In methane gas (CH4), the primary type of intermolecular force present is London dispersion forces, also known as van der Waals forces. These are weak, temporary attractive forces that occur between nonpolar molecules due to the random movement of electrons, which can create temporary dipoles. Methane is a nonpolar molecule, so it does not exhibit stronger intermolecular forces like hydrogen bonding or dipole-dipole interactions."
