    "message_1": "What is the energy released during the fission of one atom of uranium-235 and how does this energy compare to the energy released during the combustion of one molecule of methane?",
    "message_2": "The energy released during the fission of one atom of uranium-235 is approximately 200 MeV (million electron volts), which is equal to 3.2 x 10^-11 Joules. This energy is released in the form of kinetic energy of the fission fragments, as well as the energy of emitted neutrons and gamma rays.\n\nThe energy released during the combustion of one molecule of methane (CH4) can be calculated using the enthalpy of combustion. The enthalpy of combustion of methane is approximately -890 kJ/mol. Since there are 6.022 x 10^23 molecules in one mole, the energy released by the combustion of one molecule of methane can be calculated as follows:\n\nEnergy per molecule = (-890 kJ/mol) / (6.022 x 10^23 molecules/mol) = -1.48 x 10^-20 Joules\n\nComparing the energy released during the fission of one atom of uranium-235 and the combustion of one molecule of methane:\n\nUranium-235 fission energy: 3.2 x 10^-11 Joules\nMethane combustion energy: -1.48 x 10^-20 Joules\n\nThe energy released during the fission of one atom of uranium-235 is significantly greater than the energy released during the combustion of one molecule of methane. In fact, the energy released from uranium-235 fission is roughly 2 million times greater than the energy released from methane combustion. This is why nuclear reactions, such as fission, can produce much more energy than chemical reactions, like combustion."
