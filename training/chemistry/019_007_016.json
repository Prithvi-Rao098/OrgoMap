    "message_1": "What is the reaction quotient (Q) for the following reaction at 298K, if the partial pressures of reactants and products are as follows:\n\n2NO2(g) ⇌ 2NO(g) + O2(g)\n\n[NO2] = 0.5 atm, [NO] = 0.3 atm, and [O2] = 0.7 atm.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the reaction quotient (Q) for the given reaction, we need to use the expression for Q based on the partial pressures of the reactants and products:\n\nQ = ([NO]^2 * [O2]) / [NO2]^2\n\nGiven the partial pressures of the reactants and products:\n\n[NO2] = 0.5 atm\n[NO] = 0.3 atm\n[O2] = 0.7 atm\n\nPlug these values into the Q expression:\n\nQ = (0.3^2 * 0.7) / (0.5^2)\n\nQ = (0.09 * 0.7) / 0.25\n\nQ = 0.063 / 0.25\n\nQ ≈ 0.252\n\nThe reaction quotient (Q) for the given reaction at 298K is approximately 0.252."
