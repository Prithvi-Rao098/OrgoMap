    "message_2": "To determine the concentration of lead in a given water sample using voltammetry and a standard lead solution as the reference, follow these steps:\n\n1. Prepare the standard lead solution: Dissolve a known amount of lead salt (e.g., lead nitrate) in a known volume of water to create a standard solution with a known concentration of lead ions. This will be used as the reference for comparison.\n\n2. Calibrate the voltammetric instrument: Perform a voltammetric analysis on the standard lead solution to obtain a calibration curve. This curve will show the relationship between the current response and the concentration of lead ions in the solution. Make sure to perform the analysis under the same conditions (temperature, pH, etc.) as the water sample.\n\n3. Prepare the water sample: Filter the water sample to remove any particulate matter that may interfere with the voltammetric analysis. If necessary, adjust the pH of the sample to match the pH of the standard lead solution.\n\n4. Perform voltammetric analysis on the water sample: Using the same voltammetric technique and settings as in step 2, analyze the water sample. Record the current response obtained from the analysis.\n\n5. Determine the concentration of lead in the water sample: Using the calibration curve obtained in step 2, find the corresponding concentration of lead ions for the current response obtained in step 4. This will give you the concentration of lead in the water sample.\n\n6. Report the result: Express the concentration of lead in the water sample in the appropriate units (e.g., mg/L or ppb)."
