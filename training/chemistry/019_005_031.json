    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the formation of 2 moles of water molecules from hydrogen gas and oxygen gas at standard conditions, we need to use the following equation:\n\nΔG = ΔH - TΔS\n\nwhere ΔH is the change in enthalpy, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ΔS is the change in entropy.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the formation of water is:\n\n2H₂(g) + O₂(g) → 2H₂O(l)\n\nThe standard enthalpy change (ΔH) for this reaction is -285.8 kJ/mol for the formation of 1 mole of water. Since we are considering the formation of 2 moles of water, the ΔH for this reaction will be:\n\nΔH = -285.8 kJ/mol × 2 = -571.6 kJ\n\nThe standard entropy change (ΔS) for this reaction can be calculated using the standard molar entropies of the reactants and products:\n\nΔS = ΣS(products) - ΣS(reactants)\n\nThe standard molar entropies for the substances involved in the reaction are:\n\nS(H₂) = 130.6 J/mol·K\nS(O₂) = 205.1 J/mol·K\nS(H₂O) = 69.9 J/mol·K\n\nNow, we can calculate the ΔS for the reaction:\n\nΔS = 2 × S(H₂O) - (2 × S(H₂) + S(O₂))\nΔS = 2 × 69.9 J/mol·K - (2 × 130.6 J/mol·K + 205.1 J/mol·K)\nΔS = 139.8 J/mol·K - (261.2 J/mol·K + 205.1 J/mol·K)\nΔS = -326.5 J/mol·K\n\nNow, we can calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) using the equation:\n\nΔG = ΔH - TΔS\n\nAt standard conditions, the temperature (T) is 298 K. So, we have:\n\nΔG = -571.6 kJ - (298 K × -326.5 J/mol·K × 1 kJ/1000 J)\nΔG = -571.6 kJ + 97.3 kJ\nΔG = -474.3 kJ\n\nSince we are considering the formation of 2 moles of water, the Gibbs free energy change per mole of water is:\n\nΔG per mole = -474.3 kJ / 2 = -237.15 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the Gibbs free energy change for the formation of 2 moles of water molecules from hydrogen gas and oxygen gas at standard conditions (298 K and 1 atm pressure) is -237.15 kJ/mol."
