    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat required to vaporize 200 g of water at its boiling point, we need to use the formula:\n\nq = n * ΔHvap\n\nwhere q is the heat required, n is the number of moles of water, and ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of water (n). The molar mass of water (H₂O) is 18.015 g/mol.\n\nn = mass / molar mass\nn = 200 g / 18.015 g/mol\nn ≈ 11.106 moles\n\nNow we can calculate the heat required (q) using the enthalpy of vaporization (ΔHvap) of water, which is 40.7 kJ/mol.\n\nq = n * ΔHvap\nq = 11.106 moles * 40.7 kJ/mol\nq ≈ 452.1 kJ\n\nTherefore, the amount of heat required to completely vaporize 200 g of water at its boiling point of 100°C is approximately 452.1 kJ."
