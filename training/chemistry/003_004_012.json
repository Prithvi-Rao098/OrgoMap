    "message_2": "To calculate the standard potential of a silver electrode in a 0.1 M silver nitrate solution at 25°C, we can use the Nernst equation:\n\nE = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\n\nWhere:\nE = the potential of the electrode\nE° = the standard reduction potential of the half-reaction\nR = the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\nT = the temperature in Kelvin (25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K)\nn = the number of electrons transferred in the half-reaction (1 for Ag⁺)\nF = Faraday's constant (96,485 C/mol)\nQ = the reaction quotient, which is the ratio of the concentrations of the products to the reactants\n\nFor the given half-reaction, Ag⁺(aq) + e⁻ → Ag(s), the standard reduction potential (E°) of silver is +0.7996 V.\n\nThe reaction quotient (Q) can be calculated as follows:\n\nQ = [Ag(s)] / [Ag⁺(aq)]\n\nSince the concentration of a solid (Ag) is considered to be constant and equal to 1, the reaction quotient becomes:\n\nQ = 1 / [Ag⁺(aq)]\n\nGiven that the silver nitrate solution is 0.1 M, the concentration of Ag⁺ ions is also 0.1 M:\n\nQ = 1 / 0.1 = 10\n\nNow, we can plug all the values into the Nernst equation:\n\nE = 0.7996 - (8.314 * 298.15 / (1 * 96,485)) * ln(10)\nE = 0.7996 - (0.0257) * ln(10)\nE = 0.7996 - (0.0257) * 2.303\nE ≈ 0.7996 - 0.0592\nE ≈ 0.7404 V\n\nTherefore, the standard potential of a silver electrode in a 0.1 M silver nitrate solution at 25°C is approximately 0.7404 V."
