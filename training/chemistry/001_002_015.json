    "message_2": "For a compound with the molecular formula C5H12, there are three possible chain isomers:\n\n1. n-Pentane: a straight chain of five carbon atoms\n2. Isopentane (2-methylbutane): a four-carbon chain with a methyl group attached to the second carbon\n3. Neopentane (2,2-dimethylpropane): a three-carbon chain with two methyl groups attached to the second carbon\n\nSo, there are 3 possible chain isomers for C5H12."
