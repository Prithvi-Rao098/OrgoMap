    "message_2": "It seems there is a misunderstanding in the question. Pyrite is an iron sulfide mineral with the chemical formula FeS2, and it does not contain copper (Cu). To calculate the percentage composition by mass of iron (Fe) and sulfur (S) in pyrite, we will use the molar masses of these elements.\n\nThe molar mass of iron (Fe) is 55.845 g/mol, and the molar mass of sulfur (S) is 32.066 g/mol. The molecular formula of pyrite is FeS2, so the molar mass of pyrite is:\n\nMolar mass of pyrite = Molar mass of Fe + 2 * Molar mass of S\nMolar mass of pyrite = 55.845 g/mol + 2 * 32.066 g/mol = 119.977 g/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the percentage composition by mass of iron (Fe) and sulfur (S) in pyrite:\n\nPercentage of Fe = (Molar mass of Fe / Molar mass of pyrite) * 100\nPercentage of Fe = (55.845 g/mol / 119.977 g/mol) * 100 = 46.55%\n\nPercentage of S = (2 * Molar mass of S / Molar mass of pyrite) * 100\nPercentage of S = (2 * 32.066 g/mol / 119.977 g/mol) * 100 = 53.45%\n\nSo, the percentage composition of iron (Fe) in pyrite is 46.55%, and the percentage composition of sulfur (S) is 53.45%. There is no copper (Cu) in pyrite."
