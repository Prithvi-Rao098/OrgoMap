    "message_2": "The type of inorganic solid present in a compound with the chemical formula NaCl (sodium chloride) is an ionic solid. Sodium chloride forms a crystalline lattice structure where sodium ions (Na+) and chloride ions (Cl-) are held together by strong electrostatic forces (ionic bonds) between the positively charged sodium ions and the negatively charged chloride ions."
