    "message_1": "What is the change in pH when 100 mL of 0.2 M NaOH is added to a 500 mL buffer solution containing 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH) and 0.1 M sodium acetate (CH3COONa)? (Given: Ka for acetic acid = 1.8 x 10^-5)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log ([A-]/[HA])\n\nwhere pH is the pH of the solution, pKa is the negative logarithm of the acid dissociation constant (Ka), [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base, and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the pKa of acetic acid:\n\npKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.8 x 10^-5) = 4.74\n\nNow, let's find the initial moles of acetic acid and sodium acetate in the buffer solution:\n\nmoles of CH3COOH = 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles\nmoles of CH3COONa = 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles\n\nNext, let's find the moles of NaOH added:\n\nmoles of NaOH = 0.2 M * 0.1 L = 0.02 moles\n\nWhen NaOH is added to the buffer solution, it reacts with the acetic acid to form sodium acetate and water:\n\nCH3COOH + NaOH â†’ CH3COONa + H2O\n\nSince 0.02 moles of NaOH are added, 0.02 moles of acetic acid will react and form 0.02 moles of sodium acetate. Let's update the moles of acetic acid and sodium acetate:\n\nmoles of CH3COOH (after reaction) = 0.05 - 0.02 = 0.03 moles\nmoles of CH3COONa (after reaction) = 0.05 + 0.02 = 0.07 moles\n\nThe total volume of the solution after adding NaOH is 500 mL + 100 mL = 600 mL or 0.6 L. Now, let's find the new concentrations of acetic acid and sodium acetate:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.03 moles / 0.6 L = 0.05 M\n[CH3COONa] = 0.07 moles / 0.6 L = 0.1167 M\n\nNow, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the new pH:\n\npH = pKa + log ([A-]/[HA]) = 4.74 + log (0.1167/0.05) = 4.74 + 0.87 = 5.61\n\nTo find the change in pH, subtract the initial pH from the final pH:\n\nInitial pH = 4.74 (since the buffer solution is initially at its pKa)\nChange in pH = 5.61 - 4.74 = 0.87\n\nSo, the change in pH when 100 mL of 0.2 M NaOH is added to the buffer solution is 0.87."
