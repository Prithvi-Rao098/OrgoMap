    "message_2": "To determine the potential difference between a half-cell containing a magnesium electrode and a half-cell containing a silver electrode at standard conditions, we need to look at their standard reduction potentials.\n\nThe standard reduction potential for magnesium (Mg) is:\nMg²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Mg; E° = -2.37 V\n\nThe standard reduction potential for silver (Ag) is:\nAg⁺ + e⁻ → Ag; E° = +0.80 V\n\nTo find the potential difference between the two half-cells, we need to subtract the reduction potential of the anode (the electrode that undergoes oxidation) from the reduction potential of the cathode (the electrode that undergoes reduction). In this case, magnesium has a more negative reduction potential, so it will act as the anode and undergo oxidation. Silver will act as the cathode and undergo reduction.\n\nPotential difference (E°cell) = E°cathode - E°anode\nE°cell = (+0.80 V) - (-2.37 V)\nE°cell = +3.17 V\n\nThe potential difference between the magnesium and silver half-cells is +3.17 V.\n\nNow, let's find the net cell reaction. The half-cell reactions are:\n\nAnode (Mg): Mg → Mg²⁺ + 2e⁻ (oxidation)\nCathode (Ag): Ag⁺ + e⁻ → Ag (reduction)\n\nTo balance the electrons, we need to multiply the cathode reaction by 2:\n\nAnode (Mg): Mg → Mg²⁺ + 2e⁻\nCathode (Ag): 2Ag⁺ + 2e⁻ → 2Ag\n\nNow, we can add the two half-cell reactions to find the net cell reaction:\n\nMg + 2Ag⁺ → Mg²⁺ + 2Ag\n\nSo, the net cell reaction when the magnesium and silver half-cells are connected is Mg + 2Ag⁺ → Mg²⁺ + 2Ag, and the potential difference between the half-cells is +3.17 V."
