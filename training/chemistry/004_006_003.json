    "message_2": "To determine the purity percentage of an unknown substance based on its melting point, you will need to compare it to the known melting point of a pure standard of the same substance. Impurities in a substance typically lower its melting point and broaden the melting point range. Here's how to calculate the purity percentage:\n\n1. Determine the melting point of the pure standard substance.\n2. Determine the melting point of the unknown substance.\n3. Calculate the difference between the two melting points.\n4. Use the difference to estimate the purity percentage.\n\nPlease note that this method provides an estimation of the purity percentage and may not be entirely accurate. For a more accurate determination of purity, other analytical techniques such as chromatography or spectroscopy should be employed.\n\nIf you can provide the melting points of the unknown substance and the pure standard, I can help you estimate the purity percentage."
