    "message_2": "To modify the chemical structure of a potential new skin disease treatment in order to increase its efficacy and reduce its toxicity for human consumption, several strategies can be employed. These strategies are based on the principles of medicinal chemistry and drug design. Some of these strategies include:\n\n1. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies: Analyze the relationship between the chemical structure of the compound and its biological activity. This can help identify the key functional groups and structural features responsible for the compound's therapeutic effect and toxicity. Modifications can then be made to enhance the desired properties and minimize the undesired ones.\n\n2. Prodrugs: Design a prodrug, which is an inactive or less toxic form of the active compound that is converted into the active form in the body. This can help reduce toxicity and improve the pharmacokinetic properties of the compound, such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion.\n\n3. Bioisosteres: Replace a functional group in the compound with a bioisostere, which is a group that has similar physicochemical properties but may have different biological activities. This can help maintain or improve the compound's therapeutic effect while reducing its toxicity.\n\n4. Stereochemistry: Modify the stereochemistry of the compound, such as changing the configuration of chiral centers or introducing new chiral centers. Stereoisomers can have different biological activities, and one isomer may be more potent and less toxic than the other.\n\n5. Conformational restriction: Introduce conformational restrictions to the compound by adding or modifying functional groups or incorporating cyclic structures. This can help improve the compound's selectivity for its target, which may result in increased efficacy and reduced toxicity.\n\n6. Fragment-based drug design: Identify smaller fragments of the compound that retain the desired biological activity and then optimize these fragments to improve their potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic properties.\n\n7. Computational methods: Use computational methods, such as molecular modeling, docking, and virtual screening, to predict the biological activity and toxicity of the compound and guide the design of new analogs with improved properties.\n\n8. Targeted drug delivery: Develop targeted drug delivery systems that can selectively deliver the compound to the site of action, such as the skin, while minimizing exposure to other tissues. This can help reduce systemic toxicity and improve the compound's therapeutic effect.\n\nIt is important to note that these strategies are not mutually exclusive and can be combined to optimize the chemical structure of a potential new skin disease treatment. Additionally, extensive in vitro and in vivo testing will be required to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the modified compound before it can be considered for human consumption."
