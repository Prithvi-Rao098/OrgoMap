    "message_2": "In molecular orbital theory, the bond order is calculated as the difference between the number of electrons in bonding orbitals and the number of electrons in antibonding orbitals, divided by 2.\n\nFor O2 molecule:\nOxygen has 8 electrons, so O2 has a total of 16 electrons. The molecular orbital configuration for O2 is:\n\n1s²(σ) 1s²(σ*) 2s²(σ) 2s²(σ*) 2p²(π) 2p²(π) 2p²(π) 2p²(π*)\n\nBonding electrons: 2 (in 2p²(π)) + 2 (in 2p²(π))\nAntibonding electrons: 2 (in 2p²(π*))\n\nBond order of O2 = (Bonding electrons - Antibonding electrons) / 2\nBond order of O2 = (4 - 2) / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1\n\nFor N2 molecule:\nNitrogen has 7 electrons, so N2 has a total of 14 electrons. The molecular orbital configuration for N2 is:\n\n1s²(σ) 1s²(σ*) 2s²(σ) 2s²(σ*) 2p²(π) 2p²(π) 2p²(π)\n\nBonding electrons: 2 (in 2p²(π)) + 2 (in 2p²(π))\nAntibonding electrons: 0\n\nBond order of N2 = (Bonding electrons - Antibonding electrons) / 2\nBond order of N2 = (4 - 0) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2\n\nComparing the bond orders:\nThe bond order of O2 is 1, while the bond order of N2 is 2. This means that the N2 molecule has a stronger and more stable bond compared to the O2 molecule."
