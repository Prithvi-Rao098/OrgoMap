    "message_2": "The radioisotope commonly used in nuclear medicine for imaging and diagnosis is Technetium-99m (Tc-99m). It is produced by irradiating a target material, usually Molybdenum-98 (Mo-98), with neutrons in a nuclear reactor. The Mo-98 absorbs a neutron and becomes Molybdenum-99 (Mo-99), which then decays through beta decay into Technetium-99m. The Tc-99m is then extracted from the irradiated target material using a generator system, which is often called a \"moly cow\" or \"technetium cow.\" The Tc-99m can then be used as a radiotracer in various imaging procedures, such as single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)."
