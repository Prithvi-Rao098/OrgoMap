    "message_2": "The reaction between ethanoic anhydride (CH3CO)2O and water (H2O) to form ethanoic acid (CH3COOH) is a hydrolysis reaction. The mechanism for this reaction can be explained in the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Nucleophilic attack\nWater, which acts as a nucleophile, attacks the carbonyl carbon of one of the acyl groups in ethanoic anhydride. This leads to the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate. The oxygen atom in water donates a pair of electrons to the carbonyl carbon, while the carbonyl double bond's π electrons shift to the carbonyl oxygen, creating a negative charge on the oxygen atom.\n\nStep 2: Proton transfer\nThe negatively charged oxygen atom in the tetrahedral intermediate abstracts a proton (H+) from the water molecule, which acts as a proton donor. This results in the formation of a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n\nStep 3: Reforming the carbonyl group\nThe negatively charged oxygen atom donates its electron pair back to form a double bond with the carbonyl carbon. At the same time, the electrons from the oxygen-carbon bond in the adjacent acyl group shift to the oxygen atom, breaking the bond between the two acyl groups.\n\nStep 4: Formation of ethanoic acid\nThe negatively charged oxygen atom in the leaving acyl group abstracts a proton (H+) from the hydroxide ion (OH-) formed in step 2. This results in the formation of ethanoic acid (CH3COOH).\n\nOverall, the reaction can be summarized as follows:\n\n(CH3CO)2O + H2O → 2 CH3COOH\n\nIn this reaction, ethanoic anhydride is hydrolyzed by water to form two molecules of ethanoic acid. The mechanism involves nucleophilic attack, proton transfer, and the breaking and reforming of bonds."
