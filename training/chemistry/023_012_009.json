    "message_2": "To determine the amount of toluene and nitric acid needed to prepare 100 grams of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), we need to use stoichiometry and the balanced chemical equation for the synthesis of TNT.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the synthesis of TNT is:\n\nC7H8 (toluene) + 3 HNO3 (nitric acid) → C7H5N3O6 (TNT) + 3 H2O (water)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the molar masses of the reactants and product:\n\nToluene (C7H8): (7 × 12.01 g/mol C) + (8 × 1.01 g/mol H) = 92.14 g/mol\nNitric acid (HNO3): (1 × 1.01 g/mol H) + (1 × 14.01 g/mol N) + (3 × 16.00 g/mol O) = 63.02 g/mol\nTNT (C7H5N3O6): (7 × 12.01 g/mol C) + (5 × 1.01 g/mol H) + (3 × 14.01 g/mol N) + (6 × 16.00 g/mol O) = 227.13 g/mol\n\nNow, we can use stoichiometry to determine the amounts of toluene and nitric acid needed:\n\n1. Calculate the moles of TNT needed:\n100 g TNT × (1 mol TNT / 227.13 g TNT) = 0.440 mol TNT\n\n2. Calculate the moles of toluene and nitric acid needed:\n0.440 mol TNT × (1 mol C7H8 / 1 mol TNT) = 0.440 mol C7H8 (toluene)\n0.440 mol TNT × (3 mol HNO3 / 1 mol TNT) = 1.320 mol HNO3 (nitric acid)\n\n3. Calculate the mass of toluene and nitric acid needed:\n0.440 mol C7H8 × (92.14 g/mol C7H8) = 40.54 g toluene\n1.320 mol HNO3 × (63.02 g/mol HNO3) = 83.19 g nitric acid\n\nSo, to prepare 100 grams of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene with a 100% yield, you would need 40.54 grams of toluene and 83.19 grams of nitric acid."
