    "message_2": "To determine the yield of 4-bromoacetanilide, we first need to find the theoretical yield based on the stoichiometry of the reaction and then consider the actual yield based on the efficiency of the purification and recrystallization process.\n\n1. Calculate the moles of acetanilide:\nThe molecular weight of acetanilide (C8H9NO) is 135.17 g/mol.\nmoles of acetanilide = (5 g) / (135.17 g/mol) = 0.0370 mol\n\n2. Determine the stoichiometry of the reaction:\nThe balanced equation for the bromination of acetanilide is:\nC8H9NO + Br2 â†’ C8H8BrNO + HBr\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of acetanilide reacts with 1 mole of bromine to produce 1 mole of 4-bromoacetanilide.\n\n3. Calculate the theoretical yield of 4-bromoacetanilide:\nThe molecular weight of 4-bromoacetanilide (C8H8BrNO) is 214.06 g/mol.\ntheoretical yield = (0.0370 mol) * (214.06 g/mol) = 7.916 g\n\n4. Consider the actual yield based on the efficiency of the purification and recrystallization process:\nThe actual yield of 4-bromoacetanilide will be lower than the theoretical yield due to losses during the purification and recrystallization process. The efficiency of these processes can vary depending on the specific laboratory techniques used. \n\nAssuming an efficiency of 80% (a reasonable estimate for a well-performed reaction and purification):\nactual yield = (theoretical yield) * (efficiency) = (7.916 g) * (0.80) = 6.333 g\n\nThus, the yield of 4-bromoacetanilide obtained when 5 grams of acetanilide is reacted with excess bromine and the resulting mixture is purified and recrystallized using standard laboratory techniques is approximately 6.333 grams."
