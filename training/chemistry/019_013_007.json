    "message_2": "The standard enthalpy change for the neutralization reaction of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) at 25°C and 1 atm pressure can be determined using the standard enthalpy of formation values for the reactants and products.\n\nThe balanced equation for the reaction is: HCl (aq) + NaOH (aq) → NaCl (aq) + H2O (l)\n\nUsing the standard enthalpy of formation values (ΔHf°) at 25°C:\n\nΔHf° (HCl, aq) = -167.2 kJ/mol\nΔHf° (NaOH, aq) = -469.15 kJ/mol\nΔHf° (NaCl, aq) = -407.27 kJ/mol\nΔHf° (H2O, l) = -285.83 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the reaction (ΔH°) can be calculated using Hess's law:\n\nΔH° = Σ [ΔHf° (products)] - Σ [ΔHf° (reactants)]\n\nΔH° = [(-407.27 kJ/mol) + (-285.83 kJ/mol)] - [(-167.2 kJ/mol) + (-469.15 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH° = (-693.1 kJ/mol) - (-636.35 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH° = -56.75 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the neutralization reaction of HCl and NaOH at 25°C and 1 atm pressure is -56.75 kJ/mol."
