    "message_2": "To calculate the cell potential for the given electrochemical reaction, we can use the Nernst equation. However, since we are given standard reduction potentials and the temperature is 25°C, we can simplify the calculation by using the following equation:\n\nE°(cell) = E°(cathode) - E°(anode)\n\nFirst, we need to identify the cathode and anode half-reactions. The cathode is where reduction occurs, and the anode is where oxidation occurs. In this case:\n\nOxidation (anode): Zn(s) → Zn²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻, E°(Zn²⁺/Zn) = −0.76 V\nReduction (cathode): 2Ag⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → 2Ag(s), E°(Ag⁺/Ag) = +0.80 V\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nE°(cell) = E°(cathode) - E°(anode)\nE°(cell) = (+0.80 V) - (−0.76 V)\nE°(cell) = 0.80 V + 0.76 V\nE°(cell) = 1.56 V\n\nThe cell potential for the given electrochemical reaction at 25°C is 1.56 V."
