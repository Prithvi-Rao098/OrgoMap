    "message_2": "To calculate the formal charge on the nitrogen atom in the nitrate ion (NO3⁻), we can use the following formula:\n\nFormal charge = (Valence electrons of the atom) - (Non-bonding electrons) - 1/2 (Bonding electrons)\n\nFor nitrogen (N) in NO3⁻:\n1. Valence electrons of nitrogen = 5 (since nitrogen is in Group 15)\n2. Non-bonding electrons = 0 (since all electrons are involved in bonding)\n3. Bonding electrons = 6 (since there are three single bonds to the three oxygen atoms, and each bond has 2 electrons)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nFormal charge = 5 - 0 - 1/2 (6)\nFormal charge = 5 - 3\nFormal charge = +2\n\nHowever, we need to consider the resonance structures of the nitrate ion. In reality, the nitrate ion has three equivalent resonance structures, each with one double bond and two single bonds. So, we can distribute the +2 charge over the three N-O bonds:\n\nFormal charge on N (averaged over resonance structures) = +2 / 3 ≈ +0.67\n\nSo, the formal charge on the nitrogen atom in the nitrate ion (NO3⁻) is approximately +0.67 when considering resonance structures."
