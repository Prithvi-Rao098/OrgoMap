    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction at 25°C, we can use the expression:\n\nKc = [CH4][H2O] / ([CO][H2]^3)\n\nGiven the equilibrium concentrations:\n[CO] = 0.10 M\n[H2] = 0.20 M\n[CH4] = 0.015 M\n[H2O] = 0.035 M\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Kc expression:\n\nKc = (0.015)(0.035) / ((0.10)(0.20)^3)\n\nKc = (0.015)(0.035) / ((0.10)(0.008))\n\nKc = 0.000525 / 0.0008\n\nKc ≈ 0.656\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction at 25°C is approximately 0.656."
