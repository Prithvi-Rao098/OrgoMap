    "message_2": "In the compound [Co(NH3)6]Br3, the central metal atom is cobalt (Co). To determine its oxidation state, we need to consider the charges of the ligands and counterions.\n\nNH3 is a neutral ligand, meaning it does not contribute any charge to the complex. The complex has a charge of +3 due to the three bromide ions (Br-) acting as counterions. Since there are no other charges within the complex, the oxidation state of cobalt must be +3 to balance the overall charge.\n\nSo, the oxidation state of the central metal atom (cobalt) in the compound [Co(NH3)6]Br3 is +3."
