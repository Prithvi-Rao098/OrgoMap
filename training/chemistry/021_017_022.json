    "message_2": "In a sample of water at room temperature, the primary type of intermolecular forces present are hydrogen bonds. These are strong dipole-dipole interactions that occur between the partially positive hydrogen atoms of one water molecule and the partially negative oxygen atoms of another water molecule. Additionally, there are also weaker London dispersion forces (also known as van der Waals forces) present in the sample."
