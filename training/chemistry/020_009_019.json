    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g), we can use the expression:\n\nKc = [NH3]^2 / ([N2] * [H2]^3)\n\nwhere [NH3], [N2], and [H2] represent the equilibrium partial pressures of the respective gases.\n\nGiven the partial pressures of N2, H2, and NH3 as 0.5 atm, 0.7 atm, and 0.8 atm respectively, we can plug these values into the Kc expression:\n\nKc = (0.8)^2 / (0.5 * (0.7)^3)\n\nKc = 0.64 / (0.5 * 0.3429)\n\nKc = 0.64 / 0.17145\n\nKc ≈ 3.73\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction at the given conditions is approximately 3.73."
