    "message_2": "To calculate the lattice energy of sodium chloride (NaCl), we can use the Born-Landé equation:\n\nLattice Energy (U) = - (N * A * Z^+ * Z^-) / r0\n\nwhere:\nN = Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23 mol^-1)\nA = Madelung constant (for NaCl, A = 1.748)\nZ^+ = charge on the cation (for Na^+, Z^+ = 1)\nZ^- = charge on the anion (for Cl^-, Z^- = 1)\nr0 = distance between the ions (given as 2.82 Å, which should be converted to nm: 0.282 nm)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nU = - (6.022 x 10^23 mol^-1 * 1.748 * 1 * 1) / 0.282 nm\n\nU = - (1.052 x 10^24) / 0.282 nm\n\nU = - 3.73 x 10^24 J/nm\n\nSince we need the lattice energy per mole, we can divide by Avogadro's number:\n\nU = - 3.73 x 10^24 J/nm / 6.022 x 10^23 mol^-1\n\nU = - 619.5 kJ/mol\n\nThe lattice energy of sodium chloride (NaCl) is approximately -619.5 kJ/mol."
