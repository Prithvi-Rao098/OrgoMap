    "message_1": "How much mass of silver (Ag) will be deposited onto a cathode during the electrolysis of a silver nitrate (AgNO3) solution using a current of 2.5 A for 20 minutes? The molar mass of silver is 107.868 g/mol and the Faraday constant is 96,485 C/mol.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the mass of silver deposited onto the cathode, we can use Faraday's law of electrolysis. First, we need to find the total charge passed through the solution.\n\nTotal charge (Q) = Current (I) × Time (t)\nTime needs to be converted to seconds: 20 minutes × 60 seconds/minute = 1200 seconds\n\nQ = 2.5 A × 1200 s = 3000 C\n\nNow, we need to find the number of moles of electrons (n) transferred during the electrolysis process.\n\nn = Q / Faraday constant\nn = 3000 C / 96,485 C/mol = 0.0311 mol\n\nSince the reaction for the deposition of silver is Ag+ + e- → Ag, one mole of electrons deposits one mole of silver. Therefore, the number of moles of silver deposited is equal to the number of moles of electrons transferred.\n\nMoles of silver deposited = 0.0311 mol\n\nNow, we can find the mass of silver deposited using the molar mass of silver.\n\nMass of silver deposited = Moles of silver deposited × Molar mass of silver\nMass of silver deposited = 0.0311 mol × 107.868 g/mol = 3.355 g\n\nSo, 3.355 grams of silver will be deposited onto the cathode during the electrolysis of the silver nitrate solution using a current of 2.5 A for 20 minutes."
