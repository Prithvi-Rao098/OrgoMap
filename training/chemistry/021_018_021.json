    "message_2": "A substance with both London dispersion forces and hydrogen bonding will generally have a higher boiling point compared to a substance with only London dispersion forces, given that both substances have a similar molar mass and molecular size.\n\nLondon dispersion forces are weak intermolecular forces that arise due to temporary fluctuations in electron distribution, leading to temporary dipoles. These forces are present in all molecules, regardless of their polarity.\n\nHydrogen bonding is a stronger intermolecular force that occurs between a hydrogen atom bonded to a highly electronegative atom (such as nitrogen, oxygen, or fluorine) and a lone pair of electrons on another electronegative atom. Hydrogen bonding is a specific type of dipole-dipole interaction.\n\nSince hydrogen bonding is stronger than London dispersion forces, a substance with both types of intermolecular forces will require more energy to break these interactions, resulting in a higher boiling point compared to a substance with only London dispersion forces."
