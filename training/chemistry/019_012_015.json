    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the dissolution of 2.5 moles of sodium chloride in water, we need to know the enthalpy change of the dissolution process. Unfortunately, the given information is not sufficient to directly calculate the enthalpy change for the dissolution of NaCl.\n\nHowever, I can guide you on how to approach the problem if you have the necessary information.\n\nThe dissolution of sodium chloride in water can be represented by the following equation:\n\nNaCl (s) → Na⁺ (aq) + Cl⁻ (aq)\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for this process (ΔH_dissolution) can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nΔH_dissolution = ΔH_f (products) - ΔH_f (reactants)\n\nWhere ΔH_f (products) is the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of the products, and ΔH_f (reactants) is the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of the reactants.\n\nIn this case, you are given the standard enthalpy of formation of NaCl (-411.1 kJ/mol), but you need the standard enthalpies of formation for Na⁺ (aq) and Cl⁻ (aq) to complete the calculation.\n\nOnce you have the standard enthalpy change for the dissolution of NaCl, you can calculate the enthalpy change for dissolving 2.5 moles of NaCl using the following equation:\n\nΔH_total = ΔH_dissolution * moles of NaCl\n\nΔH_total = ΔH_dissolution * 2.5\n\nThis will give you the standard enthalpy change for the dissolution of 2.5 moles of sodium chloride in water at 25°C."
