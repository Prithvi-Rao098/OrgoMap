    "message_2": "To calculate the bond dissociation energy of the carbon-hydrogen bond in methane (CH4), we first need to consider the balanced combustion reaction of methane:\n\nCH4 + 2O2 â†’ CO2 + 2H2O\n\nFrom the given information, the combustion of 1 mole of methane releases 890.4 kJ of heat. In the reaction, there are 4 carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds in methane that are broken and new bonds are formed in the products.\n\nThe heat released in the reaction is the difference between the energy of the bonds broken and the energy of the bonds formed. To find the bond dissociation energy of a single C-H bond, we need to divide the total energy released by the number of C-H bonds in methane.\n\nBond dissociation energy of C-H bond = (Total energy released) / (Number of C-H bonds)\n\nBond dissociation energy of C-H bond = 890.4 kJ / 4\n\nBond dissociation energy of C-H bond = 222.6 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the bond dissociation energy of the carbon-hydrogen bond in methane (CH4) is approximately 222.6 kJ/mol."
