    "message_2": "The pH of a solution is calculated using the formula:\n\npH = -log10[H+]\n\nwhere [H+] is the hydrogen ion concentration.\n\nGiven the hydrogen ion concentration of 1.5 x 10^-6 M, we can calculate the pH as follows:\n\npH = -log10(1.5 x 10^-6)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\npH â‰ˆ 5.82\n\nSo, the pH value of the solution is approximately 5.82."
