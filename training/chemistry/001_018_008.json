    "message_2": "To find the pKa value of acetic acid, we can use the formula:\n\npKa = -log(Ka)\n\nGiven the Ka value for acetic acid is 1.8 × 10⁻⁵, we can calculate the pKa as follows:\n\npKa = -log(1.8 × 10⁻⁵)\npKa ≈ 4.74\n\nNow, to find the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid, we can use the formula for weak acids:\n\nKa = [H+][A-]/[HA]\n\nWhere [H+] is the concentration of hydrogen ions, [A-] is the concentration of acetate ions, and [HA] is the concentration of acetic acid. Since acetic acid is a weak acid, we can assume that the concentration of hydrogen ions [H+] is equal to the concentration of acetate ions [A-]. Let x be the concentration of [H+] and [A-]. Then, the equation becomes:\n\n1.8 × 10⁻⁵ = x²/(0.1 - x)\n\nSince x is much smaller than 0.1, we can approximate the equation as:\n\n1.8 × 10⁻⁵ ≈ x²/0.1\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nx² ≈ 1.8 × 10⁻⁵ × 0.1\nx² ≈ 1.8 × 10⁻⁶\nx ≈ √(1.8 × 10⁻⁶)\nx ≈ 1.34 × 10⁻³\n\nNow that we have the concentration of hydrogen ions [H+], we can find the pH using the formula:\n\npH = -log[H+]\n\npH = -log(1.34 × 10⁻³)\npH ≈ 2.87\n\nSo, the pKa value of acetic acid is approximately 4.74, and the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid is approximately 2.87."
