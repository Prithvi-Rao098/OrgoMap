    "message_2": "To calculate the corrosion current density, we can use the mixed potential theory and the Butler-Volmer equation. The anodic and cathodic reactions can be represented as follows:\n\nAnodic reaction: Cu → Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻\nCathodic reaction: 2H⁺ + 2e⁻ → H₂\n\nFirst, we need to determine the exchange current densities for both the anodic and cathodic reactions. The exchange current density (i₀) can be calculated using the Tafel equation:\n\nη = b * log(i / i₀)\n\nwhere η is the overpotential, b is the Tafel constant, and i is the current density. We can rearrange the equation to solve for i₀:\n\ni₀ = i / 10^(η / b)\n\nFor the anodic reaction, we have:\n\nη_anodic = E_corr - E_anodic = -0.35 V - 0 V = -0.35 V\nb_anodic = 120 mV/dec = 0.12 V/dec\n\nFor the cathodic reaction, we have:\n\nη_cathodic = E_corr - E_cathodic = -0.35 V - (-0.35 V) = 0 V\nb_cathodic = 60 mV/dec = 0.06 V/dec\n\nNow, we can use the Butler-Volmer equation to calculate the current densities for both reactions:\n\ni_anodic = i₀_anodic * (10^(η_anodic / b_anodic) - 1)\ni_cathodic = i₀_cathodic * (10^(η_cathodic / b_cathodic) - 1)\n\nSince the corrosion potential is the point where the anodic and cathodic current densities are equal (i_anodic = i_cathodic), we can set the two equations equal to each other:\n\ni₀_anodic * (10^(-0.35 / 0.12) - 1) = i₀_cathodic * (10^(0 / 0.06) - 1)\n\nSolving for the ratio of exchange current densities:\n\ni₀_anodic / i₀_cathodic = (10^(0 / 0.06) - 1) / (10^(-0.35 / 0.12) - 1)\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the exchange current density ratio is equal to the concentration ratio raised to the power of the number of electrons transferred in the reaction:\n\n(i₀_anodic / i₀_cathodic) = (c_Cu²⁺ / c_H⁺)²\n\nSince the concentration of Cu²⁺ is negligible compared to the concentration of H⁺, we can assume that c_Cu²⁺ ≈ 0 and c_H⁺ = 3 M:\n\n(i₀_anodic / i₀_cathodic) = (0 / 3)² = 0\n\nThis means that the anodic exchange current density is negligible compared to the cathodic exchange current density. Therefore, the corrosion current density is approximately equal to the cathodic current density:\n\ni_corr ≈ i_cathodic = i₀_cathodic * (10^(0 / 0.06) - 1)\n\nSince the overpotential for the cathodic reaction is 0, the corrosion current density is equal to the cathodic exchange current density:\n\ni_corr ≈ i₀_cathodic\n\nUnfortunately, without more information about the system, we cannot determine the exact value of the exchange current density and, therefore, the corrosion current density. However, we have shown that the corrosion current density is approximately equal to the cathodic exchange current density in this system."
