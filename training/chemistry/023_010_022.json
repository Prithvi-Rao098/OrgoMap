    "message_2": "To calculate the yield of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, we first need to determine the limiting reactant and the theoretical yield.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nN2H4 + C6H3Cl(NO2)2 → C6H3(NO2)2N2H3 + HCl\n\nMolar mass of hydrazine (N2H4) = (2 × 14.01) + (4 × 1.01) = 32.05 g/mol\nMolar mass of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (C6H3Cl(NO2)2) = 12.01 × 6 + 1.01 × 3 + 35.45 + 14.01 × 2 + 16.00 × 4 = 202.56 g/mol\nMolar mass of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (C6H3(NO2)2N2H3) = 12.01 × 6 + 1.01 × 3 + 14.01 × 2 + 1.01 × 3 + 16.00 × 4 = 198.14 g/mol\n\nMoles of hydrazine = 5 g / 32.05 g/mol = 0.156 moles\nMoles of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene = 7 g / 202.56 g/mol = 0.0345 moles\n\nThe stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, so we can determine the limiting reactant by comparing the mole ratios:\n\n0.156 moles N2H4 / 1 = 0.156\n0.0345 moles C6H3Cl(NO2)2 / 1 = 0.0345\n\nSince 0.0345 is smaller than 0.156, 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow we can calculate the theoretical yield:\n\n0.0345 moles C6H3Cl(NO2)2 × (1 mol C6H3(NO2)2N2H3 / 1 mol C6H3Cl(NO2)2) × 198.14 g/mol = 6.83 g\n\nFinally, we can calculate the percentage yield:\n\n(Actual yield / Theoretical yield) × 100 = (4.5 g / 6.83 g) × 100 = 65.89%\n\nThe yield of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine is 65.89%."
