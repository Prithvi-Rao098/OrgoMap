    "message_2": "The balanced chemical equation for the synthesis of nylon-6,6 from adipic acid and hexamethylenediamine is:\n\nC6H10O4 (adipic acid) + C6H16N2 (hexamethylenediamine) â†’ [-OC(CH2)4CO-NH(CH2)6NH-]n (nylon-6,6) + 2H2O (water)\n\nTo calculate the theoretical yield of nylon-6,6, you need to know the amount (in moles) of adipic acid and hexamethylenediamine you have. The reaction is a 1:1 ratio, meaning that one mole of adipic acid reacts with one mole of hexamethylenediamine to produce one mole of nylon-6,6.\n\nFirst, find the limiting reagent. This is the reagent that will be completely consumed in the reaction and will determine the maximum amount of product that can be formed. To do this, divide the moles of each reagent by their respective stoichiometric coefficients (both are 1 in this case) and find the smallest value.\n\nNext, use the limiting reagent to calculate the theoretical yield of nylon-6,6. Multiply the moles of the limiting reagent by the stoichiometric coefficient of nylon-6,6 (1) and the molar mass of nylon-6,6. The molar mass of nylon-6,6 is difficult to determine precisely, as it is a polymer with a variable chain length (n). However, you can calculate the theoretical yield based on the repeating unit:\n\nRepeating unit of nylon-6,6: [-OC(CH2)4CO-NH(CH2)6NH-]\nMolar mass of the repeating unit: (12.01*8) + (1.01*2) + (16.00*2) + (14.01*2) + (1.01*4) = 226.32 g/mol\n\nTheoretical yield (in grams) = moles of limiting reagent * molar mass of the repeating unit of nylon-6,6\n\nThis will give you the theoretical yield of nylon-6,6 in grams that can be produced from the given amount of starting materials."
