    "message_2": "The Lewis structure for carbon dioxide (CO2) is:\n\nO = C = O\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how to draw the Lewis structure:\n\n1. Count the total number of valence electrons: Carbon (C) has 4 valence electrons, and each oxygen (O) atom has 6 valence electrons. So, the total number of valence electrons is 4 + 6(2) = 16.\n\n2. Place the least electronegative atom in the center: In CO2, carbon is the least electronegative atom, so it will be in the center.\n\n3. Connect the central atom to the surrounding atoms with single bonds: Connect the carbon atom to each oxygen atom with a single bond. This uses up 4 valence electrons (2 for each bond).\n\n4. Distribute the remaining valence electrons to satisfy the octet rule: There are 12 valence electrons left (16 - 4). Each oxygen atom needs 6 more electrons to complete its octet. So, distribute the remaining electrons in pairs to each oxygen atom. Now, each oxygen atom has 8 electrons (2 from the bond and 6 non-bonding electrons).\n\n5. Check if the central atom has a complete octet: The carbon atom has only 4 electrons (2 from each bond). To satisfy the octet rule, it needs 4 more electrons. To achieve this, move two non-bonding electrons from each oxygen atom to form double bonds with the carbon atom.\n\nThe final Lewis structure for CO2 is:\n\nO = C = O"
