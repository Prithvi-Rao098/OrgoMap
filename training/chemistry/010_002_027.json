    "message_2": "To determine the oxidation state of nitrogen in the compound nitric acid (HNO3), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the oxidation states of the other elements in the compound.\n2. Use the oxidation state rules to determine the oxidation state of nitrogen.\n3. Verify the sum of the oxidation states equals the overall charge of the compound.\n\nStep 1: Identify the oxidation states of the other elements in the compound.\nIn HNO3, we have hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N), and oxygen (O). The oxidation state of hydrogen is typically +1, and the oxidation state of oxygen is typically -2.\n\nStep 2: Use the oxidation state rules to determine the oxidation state of nitrogen.\nLet the oxidation state of nitrogen be x. The compound HNO3 is neutral, so the sum of the oxidation states of all the elements in the compound should equal zero.\n\nWe can set up the following equation:\n(+1) + x + 3(-2) = 0\n\nStep 3: Verify the sum of the oxidation states equals the overall charge of the compound.\nSolve the equation for x:\n(+1) + x - 6 = 0\nx - 5 = 0\nx = +5\n\nTherefore, the oxidation state of nitrogen in the compound nitric acid (HNO3) is +5."
