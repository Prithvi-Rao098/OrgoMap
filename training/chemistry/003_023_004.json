    "message_2": "To find the amount of heat absorbed or released during the combustion of 25 grams of methane gas, we can use the following equation:\n\nq = n * ∆H\n\nwhere q is the heat absorbed or released, n is the number of moles of methane, and ∆H is the enthalpy change for the reaction.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of methane (n):\n\nMethane (CH4) has a molar mass of 12.01 g/mol (C) + 4 * 1.01 g/mol (H) = 16.05 g/mol.\n\nn = mass / molar mass\nn = 25 g / 16.05 g/mol\nn = 1.557 moles\n\nNext, we need to find the enthalpy change for the reaction (∆H):\n\n∆H = ∆Hf(products) - ∆Hf(reactants)\n\nFor the products:\n1 mol CO2: -393.51 kJ/mol\n2 mol H2O: 2 * -285.83 kJ/mol = -571.66 kJ/mol\n\nFor the reactants:\n1 mol CH4: -74.81 kJ/mol\n2 mol O2: 2 * 0 kJ/mol = 0 kJ/mol\n\n∆H = (-393.51 + -571.66) - (-74.81 + 0)\n∆H = -965.17 + 74.81\n∆H = -890.36 kJ/mol\n\nNow we can find the heat absorbed or released (q):\n\nq = n * ∆H\nq = 1.557 moles * -890.36 kJ/mol\nq = -1385.94 kJ\n\nThe combustion of 25 grams of methane gas releases approximately 1385.94 kJ of heat."
