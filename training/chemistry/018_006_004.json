    "message_2": "The addition of a catalyst, such as catalase, significantly increases the rate of decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). A catalyst is a substance that speeds up a chemical reaction without being consumed or altered in the process. In the case of hydrogen peroxide decomposition, catalase lowers the activation energy required for the reaction to occur, allowing it to proceed at a much faster rate.\n\nHydrogen peroxide naturally decomposes into water (H2O) and oxygen (O2) over time, but this process is relatively slow. The reaction can be represented by the following equation:\n\n2 H2O2 â†’ 2 H2O + O2\n\nWhen catalase is introduced, it acts as a catalyst and accelerates the decomposition process. Catalase is an enzyme found in many living organisms, including humans, and it plays a crucial role in breaking down hydrogen peroxide into less harmful substances (water and oxygen) within cells.\n\nThe mechanism by which catalase increases the rate of hydrogen peroxide decomposition involves the formation of an enzyme-substrate complex. The catalase binds to the hydrogen peroxide molecules, facilitating the breakdown into water and oxygen. Once the reaction is complete, the catalase is released and can bind to another hydrogen peroxide molecule, repeating the process.\n\nIn summary, the addition of a catalyst like catalase greatly increases the rate of hydrogen peroxide decomposition by lowering the activation energy required for the reaction. This allows the reaction to proceed more quickly and efficiently, resulting in the rapid production of water and oxygen."
