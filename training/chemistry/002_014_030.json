    "message_2": "To determine the formal charge on the nitrogen atom in the ammonium ion (NH4+), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the number of valence electrons for nitrogen.\n2. Calculate the number of electrons assigned to nitrogen in the ammonium ion.\n3. Subtract the assigned electrons from the valence electrons to get the formal charge.\n\nStep 1: Determine the number of valence electrons for nitrogen.\nNitrogen is in group 15 (or group 5A) of the periodic table, so it has 5 valence electrons.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of electrons assigned to nitrogen in the ammonium ion.\nIn the ammonium ion, nitrogen is bonded to four hydrogen atoms. Each bond consists of two electrons, one from nitrogen and one from hydrogen. Since nitrogen is more electronegative than hydrogen, it will \"own\" the electron pair in each bond. Therefore, nitrogen will have 4 electron pairs, which equals 8 electrons assigned to it.\n\nStep 3: Subtract the assigned electrons from the valence electrons to get the formal charge.\nFormal charge = Valence electrons - Assigned electrons\nFormal charge = 5 - 8\nFormal charge = -3\n\nHowever, we need to consider the positive charge of the ammonium ion (NH4+). Since the overall charge of the ion is +1, we need to add this charge to the formal charge calculated above.\n\nAdjusted formal charge = -3 + 1\nAdjusted formal charge = -2\n\nSo, the formal charge on the nitrogen atom in the ammonium ion (NH4+) is -2."
