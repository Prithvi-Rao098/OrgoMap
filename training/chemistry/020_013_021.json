    "message_1": "What is the equilibrium constant expression for the dissociation of acetic acid (CH3COOH) in water at 25°C, given that the acid dissociation constant (Ka) for acetic acid is 1.8 x 10^-5? Calculate the equilibrium constant, Kc, if the initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.10 M and the equilibrium concentration of hydrogen ions is 2.2 x 10^-5 M.",
    "message_2": "To write the equilibrium constant expression for the dissociation of acetic acid (CH₃COOH) in water, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nCH₃COOH (aq) + H₂O (l) ⇌ CH₃COO⁻ (aq) + H₃O⁺ (aq)\n\nSince the concentration of water is constant and does not affect the equilibrium, we can simplify the equation to:\n\nCH₃COOH (aq) ⇌ CH₃COO⁻ (aq) + H⁺ (aq)\n\nNow, we can write the equilibrium constant expression (Kc) for this reaction:\n\nKc = [CH₃COO⁻][H⁺] / [CH₃COOH]\n\nWe are given the acid dissociation constant (Ka) for acetic acid, which is 1.8 x 10⁻⁵. Since the reaction involves the transfer of one proton, the Ka and Kc values are the same in this case:\n\nKc = Ka = 1.8 x 10⁻⁵\n\nNow, we are given the initial concentration of acetic acid ([CH₃COOH]₀) as 0.10 M and the equilibrium concentration of hydrogen ions ([H⁺]) as 2.2 x 10⁻⁵ M. We can use these values to find the equilibrium concentrations of CH₃COO⁻ and CH₃COOH.\n\nSince the initial concentration of CH₃COO⁻ is 0, the change in concentration of CH₃COO⁻ at equilibrium is equal to the concentration of H⁺ at equilibrium:\n\n[CH₃COO⁻] = [H⁺] = 2.2 x 10⁻⁵ M\n\nThe change in concentration of CH₃COOH at equilibrium is equal to the initial concentration minus the concentration of H⁺ at equilibrium:\n\n[CH₃COOH] = [CH₃COOH]₀ - [H⁺] = 0.10 M - 2.2 x 10⁻⁵ M = 0.099978 M\n\nNow, we can plug these equilibrium concentrations into the Kc expression:\n\nKc = (2.2 x 10⁻⁵)(2.2 x 10⁻⁵) / 0.099978\n\nKc = 4.84 x 10⁻¹⁰ / 0.099978\n\nKc ≈ 1.8 x 10⁻⁵\n\nThe calculated equilibrium constant, Kc, is approximately equal to the given Ka value, which confirms that our calculations are correct."
