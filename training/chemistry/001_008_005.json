    "message_2": "The two most common methods to prepare primary alcohols from aldehydes are:\n\n1. Reduction using metal hydrides, such as sodium borohydride (NaBH4) or lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4).\n2. Catalytic hydrogenation using a metal catalyst, such as palladium on carbon (Pd/C) or platinum on carbon (Pt/C), and hydrogen gas (H2).\n\nI will describe the reaction mechanism for the reduction using sodium borohydride (NaBH4):\n\n1. Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is a reducing agent that can donate hydride ions (H-) to the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde. The boron atom in NaBH4 has a negative charge and is bonded to four hydrogen atoms. This makes it a good source of hydride ions.\n\n2. In the first step of the reaction mechanism, the hydride ion (H-) from NaBH4 attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde. This results in the formation of a new carbon-hydrogen bond and the breaking of the carbon-oxygen double bond (Ï€ bond).\n\n3. Simultaneously, the electrons from the carbon-oxygen double bond move to the oxygen atom, creating a negatively charged alkoxide intermediate.\n\n4. In the final step, the alkoxide intermediate abstracts a proton (H+) from a solvent molecule (usually water or an alcohol), which leads to the formation of the primary alcohol product.\n\nOverall, the reduction of an aldehyde using sodium borohydride results in the formation of a primary alcohol, with the carbonyl carbon being converted to an alcohol functional group."
