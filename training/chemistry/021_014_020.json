    "message_2": "The VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) geometry and molecular geometry of the carbon dioxide (CO2) molecule are both linear. In CO2, the central carbon atom is double-bonded to two oxygen atoms, and there are no lone pairs on the central atom. This arrangement results in a linear geometry with a bond angle of 180 degrees."
