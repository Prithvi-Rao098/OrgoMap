    "message_2": "To calculate the standard free energy change (ΔG°) for the redox reaction, we first need to determine the standard cell potential (E°) for the reaction. The equation to relate ΔG° and E° is:\n\nΔG° = -nFE°\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the reaction, F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol), and E° is the standard cell potential.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard reduction potentials for the half-reactions:\n\nFe^3+(aq) + e^- → Fe^2+(aq)  E° = +0.77 V\nCl2(g) + 2e^- → 2 Cl^-(aq)  E° = +1.36 V\n\nNow, we need to reverse the first half-reaction to make it an oxidation reaction:\n\nFe^2+(aq) → Fe^3+(aq) + e^-  E° = -0.77 V\n\nNow, we can add the two half-reactions to get the overall redox reaction:\n\n2 Fe^2+(aq) + Cl2(g) → 2 Fe^3+(aq) + 2 Cl^-(aq)\n\nThe overall standard cell potential (E°) is the sum of the standard potentials of the two half-reactions:\n\nE° = (-0.77 V) + (+1.36 V) = +0.59 V\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard free energy change (ΔG°):\n\nΔG° = -nFE°\n\nIn this reaction, n = 2 moles of electrons are transferred. Therefore,\n\nΔG° = -(2 mol)(96,485 C/mol)(0.59 V) = -113,932 J/mol\n\nWe can convert this to kJ/mol:\n\nΔG° = -113.932 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard free energy change for the redox reaction of 2 Fe^2+(aq) + Cl2(g) → 2 Fe^3+(aq) + 2 Cl^-(aq) at 298 K is -113.932 kJ/mol."
