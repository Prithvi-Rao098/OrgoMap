    "message_2": "In ethanol (C2H5OH), the carbon atom in the alcohol functional group (-OH) has an oxidation state of -1. This is because the oxygen atom is more electronegative than carbon and attracts the bonding electrons more strongly, resulting in a partial negative charge on the oxygen atom and a partial positive charge on the carbon atom.\n\nWhen ethanol undergoes oxidation, it can form either acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) or acetic acid (CH3COOH), depending on the reaction conditions and the oxidizing agent used.\n\nIn acetaldehyde, the carbon atom in the carbonyl group (C=O) has an oxidation state of +1. This is because the oxygen atom is more electronegative than carbon and attracts the bonding electrons more strongly, resulting in a partial negative charge on the oxygen atom and a partial positive charge on the carbon atom.\n\nIn acetic acid, the carbon atom in the carboxyl group (COOH) has an oxidation state of +3. This is because the oxygen atoms are more electronegative than carbon and attract the bonding electrons more strongly, resulting in partial negative charges on the oxygen atoms and a partial positive charge on the carbon atom.\n\nSo, the oxidation state of the carbon atom in ethanol before undergoing oxidation is -1, and after undergoing oxidation, it can be either +1 (in acetaldehyde) or +3 (in acetic acid)."
