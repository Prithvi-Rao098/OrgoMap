    "message_2": "The reaction quotient (Q) is calculated using the concentrations of the reactants and products raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients in the balanced chemical equation. For the given reaction:\n\n2NO (g) + O2 (g) ⇌ 2NO2 (g)\n\nThe formula for Q is:\n\nQ = ([NO2]^2) / ([NO]^2 * [O2])\n\nGiven the concentrations:\n\n[NO] = 0.50 M\n[O2] = 0.25 M\n[NO2] = 0.75 M\n\nPlug the values into the formula:\n\nQ = (0.75^2) / (0.50^2 * 0.25)\nQ = (0.5625) / (0.25 * 0.25)\nQ = 0.5625 / 0.0625\nQ = 9\n\nThe reaction quotient (Q) for the given reaction at 298K is 9."
