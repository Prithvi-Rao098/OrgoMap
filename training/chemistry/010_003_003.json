    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the electrochemical reaction involving the oxidation of copper to copper (II) ions, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG = -nFE\n\nwhere:\n- n is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the reaction (for the oxidation of Cu to Cu2+, n = 2)\n- F is the Faraday's constant (F = 96,485 C/mol)\n- E is the cell potential (E = 0.78 V)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate ΔG:\n\nΔG = -(2 mol)(96,485 C/mol)(0.78 V)\nΔG = -150,676.2 J/mol\n\nThe Gibbs free energy change for the electrochemical reaction involving the oxidation of copper to copper (II) ions in a solution of CuSO4 with a potential of 0.78 V at 25°C is approximately -150.7 kJ/mol."
