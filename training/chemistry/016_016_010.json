    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the formula:\n\nΔH_reaction = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH_f is the standard enthalpy of formation.\n\nFor the reactants, we have:\n1 mole of Fe2O3 with ΔH_f = -824 kJ/mol\n3 moles of H2 with ΔH_f = 0 kJ/mol (since H2 is in its standard state)\n\nFor the products, we have:\n2 moles of Fe with ΔH_f = 0 kJ/mol (since Fe is in its standard state)\n3 moles of H2O with ΔH_f = -286 kJ/mol\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nΔH_reaction = [(2 × 0) + (3 × -286)] - [(1 × -824) + (3 × 0)]\nΔH_reaction = [-858] - [-824]\nΔH_reaction = -34 kJ\n\nSo, the enthalpy change when 2 moles of Fe2O3 are reduced to form 4 moles of Fe is -34 kJ."
