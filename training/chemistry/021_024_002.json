    "message_2": "To calculate the bond order of N2+ using molecular orbital theory, we need to first determine the number of valence electrons in the molecule. Nitrogen has 5 valence electrons, and since there are two nitrogen atoms in N2, the total number of valence electrons is 10. However, since N2+ has lost one electron, we need to consider 9 valence electrons.\n\nNow, let's fill the molecular orbitals according to the aufbau principle and the energy levels of the molecular orbitals. For diatomic molecules like N2, the energy levels of molecular orbitals are as follows:\n\n1. σ1s\n2. σ*1s\n3. σ2s\n4. σ*2s\n5. π2p (degenerate orbitals)\n6. π*2p (degenerate orbitals)\n7. σ2p\n\nNow, let's fill the 9 valence electrons in the molecular orbitals:\n\n1. σ1s: 2 electrons\n2. σ*1s: 2 electrons\n3. σ2s: 2 electrons\n4. σ*2s: 2 electrons\n5. π2p: 1 electron (we fill one of the degenerate orbitals)\n\nNow, we can calculate the bond order using the formula:\n\nBond order = (number of electrons in bonding orbitals - number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\n\nBond order = (2 + 2 + 1 - 2 - 2) / 2 = (3) / 2 = 1.5\n\nSo, the bond order of N2+ is 1.5."
