    "message_2": "To calculate the entropy change (∆S) for this process, we can use the formula for the entropy change of an ideal gas during an isothermal expansion:\n\n∆S = n * R * ln(V2/V1)\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of the gas, R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), V1 is the initial volume, and V2 is the final volume.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nn = 1.0 mol\nR = 8.314 J/mol·K\nV1 = 1.0 L\nV2 = 2.0 L\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n∆S = (1.0 mol) * (8.314 J/mol·K) * ln(2.0 L / 1.0 L)\n\n∆S = (1.0 mol) * (8.314 J/mol·K) * ln(2)\n\n∆S ≈ 5.76 J/K\n\nSo the entropy change for this process is approximately 5.76 J/K."
