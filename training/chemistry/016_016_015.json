    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change of the reaction, we need to use the following equation:\n\nΔH° = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH° is the standard enthalpy change of the reaction, and ΔHf° is the standard enthalpy of formation of the respective substances.\n\nWe are given the standard enthalpy of formation of FeO (-272.0 kJ/mol) and Fe (0 kJ/mol). We also need the standard enthalpy of formation of H2O(l), which is -285.8 kJ/mol, and H2(g), which is 0 kJ/mol.\n\nNow we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔH° = [ΔHf°(Fe) + ΔHf°(H2O)] - [ΔHf°(FeO) + ΔHf°(H2)]\nΔH° = [(0 kJ/mol) + (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [(-272.0 kJ/mol) + (0 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH° = -285.8 kJ/mol + 272.0 kJ/mol\nΔH° = -13.8 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change of the reduction reaction is -13.8 kJ/mol."
