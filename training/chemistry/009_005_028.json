    "message_2": "To find the nuclear binding energy of a helium-4 nucleus, we first need to determine the mass defect. The mass defect is the difference between the total mass of the individual protons and neutrons and the actual mass of the helium-4 nucleus.\n\nA helium-4 nucleus contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons. Using the given masses for protons and neutrons:\n\nMass of 2 protons = 2 * 1.0073 atomic mass units = 2.0146 atomic mass units\nMass of 2 neutrons = 2 * 1.0087 atomic mass units = 2.0174 atomic mass units\nTotal mass of protons and neutrons = 2.0146 + 2.0174 = 4.0320 atomic mass units\n\nNow, we can find the mass defect:\n\nMass defect = Total mass of protons and neutrons - Actual mass of helium-4 nucleus\nMass defect = 4.0320 - 4.0026 = 0.0294 atomic mass units\n\nTo convert the mass defect to energy, we can use Einstein's famous equation, E=mc^2, where E is energy, m is mass, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3.0 x 10^8 meters per second). However, we need to convert the mass defect from atomic mass units to kilograms first.\n\n1 atomic mass unit = 1.66054 x 10^-27 kg\nMass defect in kg = 0.0294 atomic mass units * (1.66054 x 10^-27 kg/atomic mass unit) = 4.880 x 10^-29 kg\n\nNow, we can find the nuclear binding energy:\n\nE = mc^2\nE = (4.880 x 10^-29 kg) * (3.0 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nE = 4.392 x 10^-12 Joules\n\nTo convert the energy to electron volts (eV), we can use the conversion factor 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 Joules:\n\nNuclear binding energy = (4.392 x 10^-12 Joules) * (1 eV / 1.602 x 10^-19 Joules) = 2.74 x 10^7 eV\n\nTherefore, the nuclear binding energy of a helium-4 nucleus is approximately 2.74 x 10^7 electron volts (eV)."
