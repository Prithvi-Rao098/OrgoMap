    "message_2": "To find the new equilibrium concentration of the complex ion [Fe(CN)6]4-, we can use the reaction quotient (Q) and the equilibrium constant (Kf) for the formation of the complex ion.\n\nThe reaction for the formation of the complex ion is:\n\nFe3+ + 6CN- ⇌ [Fe(CN)6]4-\n\nLet x be the equilibrium concentration of [Fe(CN)6]4-. Then, the change in concentration of Fe3+ and CN- will be -x and -6x, respectively.\n\nAt equilibrium, the concentrations will be:\n\n[Fe3+] = 0.1 - x\n[CN-] = 0.3 - 6x\n[Fe(CN)6]4- = x\n\nNow, we can write the expression for the reaction quotient (Q):\n\nQ = [Fe(CN)6]4- / ([Fe3+] [CN-]^6)\n\nSince Q = Kf at equilibrium, we can set Q equal to the given Kf value:\n\n5 x 10^5 = x / ((0.1 - x)(0.3 - 6x)^6)\n\nNow, we need to solve this equation for x, the equilibrium concentration of [Fe(CN)6]4-. Since this equation is quite complex, we can make an assumption that x is very small compared to 0.1 and 0.3. This allows us to simplify the equation:\n\n5 x 10^5 = x / (0.1 * 0.3^6)\n\nx ≈ 5 x 10^5 * 0.1 * 0.3^6\nx ≈ 0.000729\n\nTherefore, the new equilibrium concentration of the complex ion [Fe(CN)6]4- is approximately 7.29 x 10^-4 M."
