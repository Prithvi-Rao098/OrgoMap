    "message_1": "Suppose you are given 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid and 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer solution. You add 2 mL of 1 M hydrochloric acid to the buffer solution. Calculate the new pH of the solution and explain how the buffer system resists changes in pH.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the new pH of the solution, we first need to determine the moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH), sodium acetate (CH3COONa), and hydrochloric acid (HCl) present in the solution.\n\nInitial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) = 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles\nInitial moles of sodium acetate (CH3COONa) = 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles\nMoles of hydrochloric acid (HCl) added = 1 M * 0.002 L = 0.002 moles\n\nWhen HCl is added to the buffer solution, it reacts with the sodium acetate to form acetic acid and sodium chloride (NaCl):\n\nCH3COONa + HCl → CH3COOH + NaCl\n\nThe moles of sodium acetate and HCl will decrease by 0.002 moles, while the moles of acetic acid will increase by 0.002 moles:\n\nFinal moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) = 0.05 moles + 0.002 moles = 0.052 moles\nFinal moles of sodium acetate (CH3COONa) = 0.05 moles - 0.002 moles = 0.048 moles\n\nNow, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to calculate the new pH of the solution:\n\npH = pKa + log ([A-]/[HA])\n\nThe pKa of acetic acid is 4.74. The concentrations of acetic acid and sodium acetate can be calculated by dividing the moles by the total volume of the solution (500 mL + 2 mL = 502 mL = 0.502 L):\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.052 moles / 0.502 L = 0.1036 M\n[CH3COONa] = 0.048 moles / 0.502 L = 0.0956 M\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = 4.74 + log (0.0956 / 0.1036)\npH ≈ 4.74 - 0.036\npH ≈ 4.704\n\nThe new pH of the solution is approximately 4.704.\n\nThe buffer system resists changes in pH because it contains both a weak acid (acetic acid) and its conjugate base (sodium acetate). When a strong acid like HCl is added, it reacts with the conjugate base (sodium acetate) to form more of the weak acid (acetic acid), which has a limited ability to donate protons and lower the pH. This reaction helps to neutralize the added acid and minimize the change in pH. Similarly, if a strong base were added, it would react with the weak acid to form more of the conjugate base, again minimizing the change in pH."
