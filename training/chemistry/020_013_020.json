    "message_1": "What is the equilibrium constant, Kc, for the dissociation of the weak acid HA in water, given that the initial concentration of HA is 0.10 M, the final concentration of H+ is 4.2 × 10^-4 M, and the final concentration of A- is 8.4 × 10^-5 M?",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the dissociation of the weak acid HA in water, we need to first write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nHA (aq) ⇌ H+ (aq) + A- (aq)\n\nNow, we can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations of each species:\n\n          | HA  | H+  | A-\nInitial   | 0.10 | 0   | 0\nChange    | -x  | +x  | +x\nEquilibrium | 0.10-x | x  | x\n\nGiven the final concentrations of H+ and A-, we can determine the change in concentration (x):\n\nFinal concentration of H+ = 4.2 × 10^-4 M = x\nFinal concentration of A- = 8.4 × 10^-5 M = x\n\nSince the final concentration of A- is half of the final concentration of H+, we can write:\n\nx = 8.4 × 10^-5 M\n2x = 4.2 × 10^-4 M\n\nNow we can find the equilibrium concentration of HA:\n\nInitial concentration of HA - x = 0.10 M - 8.4 × 10^-5 M = 0.099916 M\n\nNow we can calculate the equilibrium constant, Kc, using the equilibrium concentrations:\n\nKc = [H+][A-] / [HA]\nKc = (4.2 × 10^-4 M)(8.4 × 10^-5 M) / (0.099916 M)\n\nKc ≈ 3.53 × 10^-5\n\nThe equilibrium constant, Kc, for the dissociation of the weak acid HA in water is approximately 3.53 × 10^-5."
