    "message_2": "To calculate the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) for the given electrochemical reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG° = -nFE°cell\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of electrons transferred, F is the Faraday constant (96,500 C/mol), and E°cell is the standard cell potential.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the number of moles of electrons transferred (n) in the balanced reaction:\n\nCu(s) + 2Ag⁺(aq) → Cu²⁺(aq) + 2Ag(s)\n\nIn this reaction, 2 moles of electrons are transferred from Cu to 2Ag⁺. Therefore, n = 2.\n\nNow we can plug the values into the equation:\n\nΔG° = -nFE°cell\nΔG° = -(2 mol)(96,500 C/mol)(0.46 V)\n\nΔG° = -88,760 J/mol\n\nSince 1 kJ = 1,000 J, we can convert the result to kJ/mol:\n\nΔG° = -88.76 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard Gibbs free energy change for the given electrochemical reaction at 25°C is -88.76 kJ/mol."
