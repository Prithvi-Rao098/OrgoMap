    "message_2": "To calculate the theoretical yield of CO2, we first need to determine the number of moles of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) in the 10 grams given.\n\nThe molar mass of NaHCO3 is:\nNa = 23 g/mol\nH = 1 g/mol\nC = 12 g/mol\nO = 16 g/mol (x3 for three oxygen atoms)\n\nMolar mass of NaHCO3 = 23 + 1 + 12 + (16 x 3) = 84 g/mol\n\nNow, we can determine the moles of NaHCO3:\nmoles of NaHCO3 = mass / molar mass = 10 g / 84 g/mol = 0.119 moles\n\nThe balanced chemical equation shows that 1 mole of NaHCO3 reacts to produce 1 mole of CO2. Therefore, the moles of CO2 produced will be equal to the moles of NaHCO3.\n\nmoles of CO2 = 0.119 moles\n\nNow, we can calculate the mass of CO2 produced using the molar mass of CO2:\nC = 12 g/mol\nO = 16 g/mol (x2 for two oxygen atoms)\n\nMolar mass of CO2 = 12 + (16 x 2) = 44 g/mol\n\nMass of CO2 = moles of CO2 x molar mass of CO2 = 0.119 moles x 44 g/mol = 5.24 g\n\nThe theoretical yield of carbon dioxide gas is 5.24 grams."
