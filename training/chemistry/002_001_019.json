    "message_2": "To balance the chemical equation for the reaction between calcium chloride (CaCl2) and sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) to form calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and sodium chloride (NaCl), we need to ensure that the number of atoms of each element is equal on both sides of the equation.\n\nHere's the unbalanced equation:\n\nCaCl2 + Na2CO3 → CaCO3 + NaCl\n\nNow, let's balance the equation step by step:\n\n1. Balance the calcium (Ca) atoms:\nCaCl2 + Na2CO3 → CaCO3 + NaCl\n(1 Ca on both sides, no changes needed)\n\n2. Balance the chlorine (Cl) atoms:\nCaCl2 + Na2CO3 → CaCO3 + 2NaCl\n(2 Cl on both sides, added a 2 in front of NaCl)\n\n3. Balance the sodium (Na) atoms:\nCaCl2 + Na2CO3 → CaCO3 + 2NaCl\n(2 Na on both sides, no changes needed)\n\n4. Balance the carbon (C) atoms:\nCaCl2 + Na2CO3 → CaCO3 + 2NaCl\n(1 C on both sides, no changes needed)\n\n5. Balance the oxygen (O) atoms:\nCaCl2 + Na2CO3 → CaCO3 + 2NaCl\n(3 O on both sides, no changes needed)\n\nThe balanced chemical equation is:\n\nCaCl2 + Na2CO3 → CaCO3 + 2NaCl"
