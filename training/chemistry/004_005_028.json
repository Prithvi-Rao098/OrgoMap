    "message_2": "To calculate the pH of a solution with a hydrogen ion concentration of 3.5 x 10^-5 M, you can use the pH formula:\n\npH = -log10[H+]\n\nwhere [H+] is the hydrogen ion concentration.\n\nIn this case, [H+] = 3.5 x 10^-5 M.\n\npH = -log10(3.5 x 10^-5)\npH â‰ˆ 4.46\n\nThe pH of the solution is approximately 4.46."
