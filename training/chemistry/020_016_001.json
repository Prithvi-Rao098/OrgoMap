    "message_1": "What is the change in solubility of silver chloride when the concentration of calcium chloride solution is increased from 0.01 M to 0.1 M? Calculate the new solubility of silver chloride at this concentration.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the common ion effect, which states that the solubility of a sparingly soluble salt is decreased in the presence of a common ion. In this case, the common ion is chloride (Cl⁻).\n\nSilver chloride (AgCl) has a solubility product constant (Ksp) of 1.77 x 10⁻¹⁰. It dissociates into silver ions (Ag⁺) and chloride ions (Cl⁻) in water:\n\nAgCl(s) ⇌ Ag⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq)\n\nInitially, the concentration of calcium chloride (CaCl₂) is 0.01 M. Since each CaCl₂ molecule dissociates into one Ca²⁺ ion and two Cl⁻ ions, the initial concentration of Cl⁻ ions is 0.02 M.\n\nWhen the concentration of CaCl₂ is increased to 0.1 M, the concentration of Cl⁻ ions increases to 0.2 M.\n\nNow, we need to find the new solubility of AgCl in the presence of this increased concentration of Cl⁻ ions. Let x be the solubility of AgCl in moles per liter:\n\nAgCl(s) ⇌ Ag⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq)\nx (mol/L) ⇌ x (mol/L) + 0.2 (mol/L)\n\nThe solubility product constant (Ksp) expression for AgCl is:\n\nKsp = [Ag⁺][Cl⁻]\n\nSince Ksp for AgCl is 1.77 x 10⁻¹⁰:\n\n1.77 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x + 0.2)\n\nWe can assume that x is very small compared to 0.2, so we can approximate:\n\n1.77 x 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ (x)(0.2)\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nx ≈ (1.77 x 10⁻¹⁰) / 0.2\nx ≈ 8.85 x 10⁻¹²\n\nSo, the new solubility of silver chloride in the presence of 0.1 M calcium chloride is approximately 8.85 x 10⁻¹² mol/L."
