    "message_2": "Carbon monoxide (CO) is a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, meaning it consists of two different atoms. In this case, carbon (C) and oxygen (O). To calculate the molecular orbital energy diagram and electronic configuration, we will use the Molecular Orbital Theory (MOT) for heteronuclear diatomic molecules.\n\nThe atomic orbitals of carbon (C) are 1s², 2s², and 2p², while the atomic orbitals of oxygen (O) are 1s², 2s², and 2p⁴. In the formation of CO, we will focus on the valence orbitals, which are the 2s and 2p orbitals.\n\nThe molecular orbitals formed from the combination of 2s orbitals are σ(2s) and σ*(2s). The molecular orbitals formed from the combination of 2p orbitals are σ(2pz), π(2px), π(2py), σ*(2pz), π*(2px), and π*(2py).\n\nThe molecular orbital energy diagram for CO is as follows:\n\n1. σ(2s)\n2. σ*(2s)\n3. σ(2pz)\n4. π(2px) and π(2py)\n5. σ*(2pz)\n6. π*(2px) and π*(2py)\n\nNow, we will fill the molecular orbitals with the 10 valence electrons from carbon and oxygen (4 from C and 6 from O):\n\n1. σ(2s) - 2 electrons\n2. σ*(2s) - 2 electrons\n3. σ(2pz) - 2 electrons\n4. π(2px) and π(2py) - 4 electrons (2 in each orbital)\n5. σ*(2pz) - 0 electrons\n6. π*(2px) and π*(2py) - 0 electrons\n\nThe electronic configuration of CO is: σ(2s)², σ*(2s)², σ(2pz)², π(2px)², π(2py)².\n\nTo calculate the bond order, use the formula:\n\nBond order = (number of electrons in bonding orbitals - number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\n\nBond order = (8 - 2) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3\n\nThe bond order of CO is 3, indicating a strong triple bond between the carbon and oxygen atoms.\n\nAs for the magnetic behavior, all the molecular orbitals are filled with paired electrons, so CO is diamagnetic, meaning it does not have unpaired electrons and is not attracted to a magnetic field."
