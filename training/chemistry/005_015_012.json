    "message_2": "The net yield of ATP, NADH, and FADH2 molecules produced by the Citric Acid Cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle) and Oxidative Phosphorylation is as follows:\n\nFor each turn of the Citric Acid Cycle:\n- 1 ATP is produced through substrate-level phosphorylation\n- 3 NADH molecules are produced\n- 1 FADH2 molecule is produced\n\nSince the Citric Acid Cycle occurs twice per glucose molecule (once for each pyruvate), the total yield is:\n- 2 ATP\n- 6 NADH\n- 2 FADH2\n\nIn Oxidative Phosphorylation, the electrons from NADH and FADH2 are transferred through the electron transport chain (ETC) to generate a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This proton gradient drives the synthesis of ATP through the enzyme ATP synthase.\n\nThe number of ATP molecules produced per NADH and FADH2 varies depending on the efficiency of the ETC and the specific organism. However, in eukaryotes, it is generally accepted that:\n- 1 NADH molecule generates approximately 2.5 ATP molecules\n- 1 FADH2 molecule generates approximately 1.5 ATP molecules\n\nConsidering the NADH and FADH2 molecules produced in the Citric Acid Cycle, the total ATP yield through Oxidative Phosphorylation is:\n- 6 NADH x 2.5 ATP/NADH = 15 ATP\n- 2 FADH2 x 1.5 ATP/FADH2 = 3 ATP\n\nThus, the combined net yield of ATP from the Citric Acid Cycle and Oxidative Phosphorylation is:\n2 ATP (from Citric Acid Cycle) + 15 ATP (from NADH) + 3 ATP (from FADH2) = 20 ATP\n\nNote that this does not include the ATP produced during glycolysis or the conversion of pyruvate to Acetyl-CoA."
