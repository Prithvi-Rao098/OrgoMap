H2O - Covalent (formed by the sharing of electrons between two non-metals, hydrogen and oxygen)\n3. Cu - Metallic (copper is a metal and its bonding is characterized by a sea of delocalized electrons)\n4. Fe2O3 - Ionic (formed by the transfer of electrons between a metal, iron, and a non-metal, oxygen)\n5. CO2 - Covalent (formed by the sharing of electrons between two non-metals, carbon and oxygen)"
