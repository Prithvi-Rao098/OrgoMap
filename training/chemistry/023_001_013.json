    "message_2": "The synthesis of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) from salicylic acid and acetic anhydride follows a simple stoichiometric reaction:\n\nC7H6O3 (salicylic acid) + C4H6O3 (acetic anhydride) â†’ C9H8O4 (aspirin) + C2H4O2 (acetic acid)\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that the optimal molar ratio of salicylic acid to acetic anhydride is 1:1. This means that one mole of salicylic acid reacts with one mole of acetic anhydride to produce one mole of aspirin and one mole of acetic acid.\n\nIn practice, a slight excess of acetic anhydride is often used to ensure the complete conversion of salicylic acid to aspirin. However, the optimal theoretical ratio for the highest yield remains 1:1."
