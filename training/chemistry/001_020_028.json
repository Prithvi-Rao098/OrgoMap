    "message_2": "The product of the electrophilic addition reaction between propene and hydrogen bromide in the presence of a peroxide initiator is 1-bromopropane. \n\nThe presence of a peroxide initiator leads to a radical mechanism, known as the anti-Markovnikov addition. In this case, the bromine atom adds to the less substituted carbon (the terminal carbon) of the propene molecule, resulting in 1-bromopropane as the major product."
