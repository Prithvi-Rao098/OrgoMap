    "message_2": "Using the VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) theory, the predicted molecular geometry of H2O (water) is bent or V-shaped. This is because the central oxygen atom has two bonding pairs of electrons (with the two hydrogen atoms) and two lone pairs of electrons. The electron pairs repel each other and arrange themselves to minimize repulsion, resulting in a bent molecular geometry.\n\nThe bond angle between the two O-H bonds in H2O is approximately 104.5 degrees. This is smaller than the typical tetrahedral angle of 109.5 degrees because the lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen atom repel the bonding pairs more strongly, pushing the hydrogen atoms closer together."
