    "message_2": "To calculate the corrosion rate of the steel bar, we will use the following formula:\n\nCorrosion Rate (CR) = (Weight Loss × K) / (Surface Area × Time × Density)\n\nWhere:\nWeight Loss = 2.1 grams\nK = Constant (3.45 x 10^6 for the units we are using)\nSurface Area = 50 cm²\nTime = 24 hours\nDensity of steel = 7.85 g/cm³ (approximate value, as it can vary depending on the specific steel alloy)\n\nFirst, let's convert the time from hours to seconds, as the constant K is given for seconds:\n\nTime = 24 hours × 3600 seconds/hour = 86400 seconds\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nCR = (2.1 g × 3.45 x 10^6) / (50 cm² × 86400 s × 7.85 g/cm³)\nCR = (7.245 x 10^6) / (34680000)\nCR = 0.2089 mm/year\n\nThe corrosion rate of the steel bar in a 1 M solution of sulfuric acid at 25°C is approximately 0.2089 mm/year."
