The heat capacity of the calorimeter is 50 J/°C and the density of each solution is 1 g/mL. Assume that the heat capacity and density of the mixture is the same as that of water, and that the volumes of the solutions are additive.",
    "message_2": "To find the heat of mixing, we first need to determine the amount of heat released during the reaction. The reaction between HCl and NaOH is an acid-base neutralization reaction, which can be represented by the following equation:\n\nHCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H2O(l)\n\nThe enthalpy change for this reaction, ΔH, is approximately -57.1 kJ/mol.\n\nNext, we need to determine the limiting reactant. To do this, we'll calculate the moles of each reactant:\n\nmoles of HCl = volume (L) × concentration (M)\nmoles of HCl = 0.050 L × 0.1 M = 0.005 mol\n\nmoles of NaOH = volume (L) × concentration (M)\nmoles of NaOH = 0.100 L × 0.2 M = 0.020 mol\n\nSince there are fewer moles of HCl, it is the limiting reactant. The reaction will consume all 0.005 mol of HCl and produce 0.005 mol of NaCl and H2O.\n\nNow we can calculate the heat released during the reaction:\n\nq = moles of limiting reactant × ΔH\nq = 0.005 mol × (-57.1 kJ/mol) = -0.2855 kJ\n\nSince the heat released is negative, the reaction is exothermic.\n\nNow we need to find the temperature change of the mixture. The total volume of the mixture is 50 mL + 100 mL = 150 mL. Since the density of the mixture is 1 g/mL, the mass of the mixture is 150 g. The specific heat capacity of water is 4.18 J/g°C.\n\nWe can use the heat capacity of the calorimeter (Ccal) and the heat released (q) to find the temperature change (ΔT):\n\nq = (mass × specific heat capacity × ΔT) + (Ccal × ΔT)\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for ΔT:\n\nΔT = q / (mass × specific heat capacity + Ccal)\n\nΔT = -0.2855 kJ / [(150 g × 4.18 J/g°C) + 50 J/°C]\nΔT = -285.5 J / [627 J/°C] ≈ -0.455°C\n\nSince the temperature change is negative, the temperature of the mixture decreases.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the heat of mixing per mole of limiting reactant:\n\nHeat of mixing = q / moles of limiting reactant\nHeat of mixing = -0.2855 kJ / 0.005 mol ≈ -57.1 kJ/mol\n\nThe heat of mixing when 50 mL of 0.1 M HCl solution is mixed with 100 mL of 0.2 M NaOH solution at 25°C is approximately -57.1 kJ/mol."
