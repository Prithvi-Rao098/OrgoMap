    "message_2": "The bond strength of a molecule is typically measured in terms of bond dissociation energy, which is the energy required to break a bond and separate the atoms. In the case of H2O (water) and CO2 (carbon dioxide), we can compare their bond strengths by looking at their bond dissociation energies.\n\nThe bond dissociation energy for the O-H bond in H2O is approximately 460 kJ/mol. Water has two O-H bonds, but we will consider the energy of a single bond for comparison purposes.\n\nThe bond dissociation energy for the C=O bond in CO2 is approximately 750 kJ/mol. Carbon dioxide has two C=O bonds, which are double bonds.\n\nBased on these values, the bond strength of CO2 is stronger than that of H2O. The stronger bond strength in CO2 can be attributed to the double bond between carbon and oxygen, which involves the sharing of more electrons compared to the single bond in H2O. Additionally, the difference in electronegativity between carbon and oxygen is smaller than that between hydrogen and oxygen, leading to a more stable bond in CO2.\n\nIn summary, the bond strength of CO2 is stronger than that of H2O due to the presence of double bonds and a smaller difference in electronegativity between the bonded atoms."
