    "message_2": "The Langmuir adsorption isotherm equation is given by:\n\nθ = (K * C) / (1 + K * C)\n\nwhere θ is the fractional surface coverage, K is the Langmuir constant, and C is the concentration of adsorbate.\n\nIn this case, the maximum adsorption capacity occurs when the surface is fully covered, i.e., θ = 1. We can rearrange the equation to solve for the concentration of adsorbate (C) when θ = 1:\n\n1 = (K * C) / (1 + K * C)\n\n1 + K * C = K * C\n\n1 = K * C\n\nC = 1 / K\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values for K:\n\nC = 1 / 0.05 cm³/mg = 20 mg/mL\n\nSince the concentration of adsorbate in the solution is 0.1 mg/mL, which is less than the calculated C value of 20 mg/mL, the surface will not be fully covered. Therefore, we need to calculate the fractional surface coverage (θ) using the given concentration of adsorbate:\n\nθ = (0.05 cm³/mg * 0.1 mg/mL) / (1 + 0.05 cm³/mg * 0.1 mg/mL) = 0.005 / 1.005 ≈ 0.004975\n\nNow, we can calculate the maximum adsorption capacity (Q) using the fractional surface coverage and the surface area:\n\nQ = θ * Surface Area = 0.004975 * 100 cm² ≈ 0.4975 cm²\n\nThe maximum adsorption capacity of the surface at the given temperature is approximately 0.4975 cm²."
