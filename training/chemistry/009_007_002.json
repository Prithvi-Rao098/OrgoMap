    "message_2": "A radioactive isotope with a neutron-to-proton ratio of 1.8 has more neutrons than protons. In this case, the mode of decay is likely to be beta decay (specifically, beta-minus decay). \n\nIn beta-minus decay, a neutron in the nucleus is converted into a proton, an electron (called a beta particle), and an electron antineutrino. This process helps to decrease the neutron-to-proton ratio, making the nucleus more stable."
