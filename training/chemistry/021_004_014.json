    "message_2": "In the molecule CH3COOH (acetic acid), the central atom is the carbon atom in the carboxyl group (COOH). To determine the hybridization of this carbon atom, we need to consider its electron domains.\n\nThe central carbon atom in the COOH group is bonded to three other atoms: one oxygen atom in a double bond, one oxygen atom in a single bond, and one hydrogen atom in a single bond. This gives the central carbon atom a total of three electron domains.\n\nAccording to the VSEPR theory, three electron domains correspond to sp2 hybridization. Therefore, the hybridization of the central carbon atom in the molecule CH3COOH is sp2."
