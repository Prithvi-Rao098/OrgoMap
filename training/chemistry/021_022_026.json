    "message_2": "Benzoic acid (C6H5COOH) is an organic compound containing a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) attached to a benzene ring. The carboxylic acid functional group is known to be acidic due to the presence of a hydrogen atom bonded to an electronegative oxygen atom. This hydrogen atom can be easily lost as a proton (H+) in an aqueous solution, resulting in the formation of a carboxylate anion (C6H5COO-).\n\nBased on its chemical structure and functional groups, benzoic acid is predicted to be acidic."
