    "message_2": "When additional product is added to an equilibrium system, the concentration of the reactants and products will change in order to re-establish equilibrium. This can be explained using Le Chatelier's principle, which states that if a change is made to a system in equilibrium, the system will adjust itself to counteract the change and restore equilibrium.\n\nConsider the following balanced chemical equation:\n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) â‡Œ 2NH3(g)\n\nIn this reaction, nitrogen gas (N2) and hydrogen gas (H2) react to form ammonia gas (NH3). If we were to add more ammonia (NH3) to the system, the equilibrium would be disturbed, and the system would no longer be in equilibrium.\n\nAccording to Le Chatelier's principle, the system will adjust itself to counteract the increase in ammonia concentration. In this case, the reaction will shift to the left, meaning that more N2 and H2 will be produced, and the concentration of NH3 will decrease. This shift will continue until the system reaches a new equilibrium state.\n\nIn summary, when additional product is added to an equilibrium system, the reaction will shift in the direction that consumes the added product (in this case, towards the reactants) in order to re-establish equilibrium. This will result in an increase in the concentration of the reactants and a decrease in the concentration of the products."
