    "message_1": "\"When equal moles of nitrogen dioxide and dinitrogen tetroxide are present in a sealed container at a certain temperature, the color of the mixture is brown. When some dinitrogen tetroxide is added, the color of the mixture fades. Explain the changes occurring in terms of Le Chatelier's principle.\"",
    "message_2": "The brown color in the mixture is due to the presence of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which is a brown gas. Dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4) is a colorless gas. The two gases are in equilibrium with each other according to the following reaction:\n\n2 NO2 (g) â‡Œ N2O4 (g)\n\nThis equilibrium can be affected by changes in concentration, temperature, or pressure, as described by Le Chatelier's principle. Le Chatelier's principle states that if a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change, the system will adjust itself to counteract the change and restore a new equilibrium.\n\nIn this case, when more dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4) is added to the sealed container, the equilibrium is disturbed. According to Le Chatelier's principle, the system will try to counteract this change by shifting the equilibrium to the left, converting some of the added N2O4 back into NO2. This shift reduces the concentration of N2O4 and increases the concentration of NO2.\n\nHowever, since N2O4 is colorless and NO2 is brown, the overall effect of this shift is to reduce the intensity of the brown color in the mixture, causing it to fade. This fading of the color is a visual indication that the equilibrium has shifted in response to the addition of more N2O4, as predicted by Le Chatelier's principle."
