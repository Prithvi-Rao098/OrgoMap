    "message_2": "In the molecule SF6 (sulfur hexafluoride), the central atom is sulfur. To determine the hybridization of the central atom, we need to consider the number of electron domains around it.\n\nSulfur has 6 valence electrons, and each fluorine atom contributes 1 electron, making a total of 12 electrons around the sulfur atom. These 12 electrons form 6 electron domains (6 single bonds with the 6 fluorine atoms).\n\nAccording to the VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) theory, the hybridization that would accommodate 6 electron domains is sp3d2. Therefore, the hybridization of the central atom (sulfur) in the molecule SF6 is sp3d2."
