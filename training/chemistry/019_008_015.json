    "message_2": "To calculate the standard electrode potential (E°) for the redox reaction, we first need to balance the half-reactions and then combine them. \n\nThe balanced half-reactions are:\nCu2+(aq) + 2e- → Cu(s) E° = +0.34 V\n2(Fe3+(aq) + e- → Fe2+(aq)) E° = +0.77 V\n\nNow, multiply the second half-reaction by 2 to balance the number of electrons:\n2Fe3+(aq) + 2e- → 2Fe2+(aq) E° = +0.77 V\n\nNext, combine the half-reactions:\nCu2+(aq) + 2Fe2+(aq) → Cu(s) + 2Fe3+(aq)\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard electrode potential (E°) for the redox reaction using the Nernst equation:\n\nE°(cell) = E°(cathode) - E°(anode)\n\nIn this case, the Cu2+/Cu half-reaction is the cathode (reduction) and the Fe3+/Fe2+ half-reaction is the anode (oxidation). Therefore:\n\nE°(cell) = (+0.34 V) - (+0.77 V) = -0.43 V\n\nThe standard electrode potential for the redox reaction is -0.43 V."
