    "message_2": "To calculate the pH of a 0.1 M solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl), we need to find the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in the solution. Since HCl is a strong acid, it will completely dissociate in water, meaning that the concentration of H+ ions will be equal to the concentration of HCl.\n\nHCl â†’ H+ + Cl-\n\n[H+] = 0.1 M\n\nNow, we can use the pH formula:\n\npH = -log10([H+])\n\npH = -log10(0.1)\n\npH = 1\n\nSince the pH of the solution is 1, which is less than 7, the solution is acidic."
