    "message_2": "If SCN- replaces one of the water molecules in the coordination complex [Fe(H2O)6]2+, the resulting complex would be [Fe(H2O)5(SCN)]2+. The coordination number would remain the same, which is 6, as there are still six ligands surrounding the central Fe2+ ion (five water molecules and one SCN- ion). The name of the resulting complex would be penta-aqua-thiocyanato-iron(II) or penta-aqua-thiocyanato-ferrate(II)."
