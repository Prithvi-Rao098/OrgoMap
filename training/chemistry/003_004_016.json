    "message_2": "The standard reduction potential of Fe3+ to Fe2+ is +0.77 V. This value is found in standard reduction potential tables and represents the potential difference when one mole of Fe3+ ions gains one mole of electrons to form one mole of Fe2+ ions under standard conditions (1 M concentration, 25°C, and 1 atm pressure).\n\nTo determine the voltage output of a standard electrochemical cell with an iron anode and a copper cathode, we need to consider the half-reactions involved:\n\n1. Oxidation half-reaction at the anode (Iron):\nFe(s) → Fe2+(aq) + 2e⁻\nThe standard reduction potential for this reaction is -0.44 V. However, since it is an oxidation reaction, we need to reverse the sign, making it +0.44 V.\n\n2. Reduction half-reaction at the cathode (Copper):\nCu2+(aq) + 2e⁻ → Cu(s)\nThe standard reduction potential for this reaction is +0.34 V.\n\nNow, we can calculate the overall cell potential (E_cell) using the Nernst equation:\n\nE_cell = E_cathode - E_anode\n\nE_cell = (+0.34 V) - (+0.44 V) = -0.10 V\n\nThe voltage output of the standard electrochemical cell with an iron anode and a copper cathode is -0.10 V. The negative sign indicates that the reaction is not spontaneous under standard conditions."
