    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for this phase transition, we need to consider three steps:\n\n1. Heating the ice from -10.0 °C to 0 °C\n2. Melting the ice at 0 °C\n3. Heating the liquid water from 0 °C to 10.0 °C\n\nStep 1: Heating the ice from -10.0 °C to 0 °C\nq1 = mass x specific heat capacity of ice x temperature change\nq1 = 100.0 g x 2.09 J/g·°C x (0 - (-10.0 °C))\nq1 = 100.0 g x 2.09 J/g·°C x 10.0 °C\nq1 = 2090 J\n\nStep 2: Melting the ice at 0 °C\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of water:\nMolar mass of water (H2O) = 18.02 g/mol\nmoles = mass / molar mass\nmoles = 100.0 g / 18.02 g/mol\nmoles = 5.55 mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change for melting the ice:\nq2 = moles x enthalpy of fusion\nq2 = 5.55 mol x 6.01 kJ/mol\nq2 = 33.36 kJ\nConvert to J: q2 = 33.36 kJ x 1000 J/kJ = 33360 J\n\nStep 3: Heating the liquid water from 0 °C to 10.0 °C\nq3 = mass x specific heat capacity of water x temperature change\nq3 = 100.0 g x 4.18 J/g·°C x (10.0 °C - 0 °C)\nq3 = 100.0 g x 4.18 J/g·°C x 10.0 °C\nq3 = 4180 J\n\nNow, we can find the total enthalpy change for the entire process by adding the enthalpy changes for each step:\nTotal enthalpy change = q1 + q2 + q3\nTotal enthalpy change = 2090 J + 33360 J + 4180 J\nTotal enthalpy change = 39630 J\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the phase transition reaction is 39,630 J or 39.63 kJ."
