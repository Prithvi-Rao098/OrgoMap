    "message_2": "The electronegativity of an element is a measure of its ability to attract electrons in a chemical bond. In the case of NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), we can find the electronegativity difference between oxygen and nitrogen atoms by referring to the Pauling electronegativity scale.\n\nAccording to the Pauling scale, the electronegativity of nitrogen (N) is 3.04, and the electronegativity of oxygen (O) is 3.44. To find the electronegativity difference between these two elements, we can simply subtract the electronegativity of nitrogen from that of oxygen:\n\nElectronegativity difference = Electronegativity of oxygen - Electronegativity of nitrogen\nElectronegativity difference = 3.44 - 3.04\nElectronegativity difference = 0.40\n\nSo, the electronegativity difference between oxygen and nitrogen atoms in a molecule of NO2 is 0.40."
