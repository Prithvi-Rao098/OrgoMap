(Hint: The standard electrode potentials for Fe3+/Fe2+ = 0.771 V)",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (K) for the redox reaction, we can use the Nernst equation:\n\nE = E° - (RT/nF) * lnQ\n\nWhere:\nE = the cell potential at equilibrium (0 V, since it's at equilibrium)\nE° = the standard electrode potential (0.771 V)\nR = the gas constant (8.314 J/mol*K)\nT = the temperature (298 K)\nn = the number of electrons transferred (1, since it's a one-electron redox reaction)\nF = Faraday's constant (96,485 C/mol)\nQ = the reaction quotient, which is equal to [Fe2+]/[Fe3+] at equilibrium\n\nFirst, we need to find the concentration of Fe3+ at equilibrium. Since the initial concentration of Fe3+ was 0.02 M and the final concentration of Fe2+ is 0.014 M, the change in concentration is 0.006 M. Therefore, the equilibrium concentration of Fe3+ is 0.02 - 0.006 = 0.014 M.\n\nNow we can find Q:\n\nQ = [Fe2+]/[Fe3+] = 0.014/0.014 = 1\n\nNow we can use the Nernst equation to find the equilibrium constant:\n\n0 = 0.771 - (8.314 * 298 / (1 * 96,485)) * ln(1)\n\nSince ln(1) = 0, the equation simplifies to:\n\n0 = 0.771 - 0\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium constant (K) for the redox reaction is:\n\nK = 10^(n*E°/0.0591) = 10^(1*0.771/0.0591) = 10^13.04 ≈ 1.1 x 10^13"
