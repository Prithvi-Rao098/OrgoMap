    "message_2": "Primary, secondary, and tertiary amines are organic compounds containing nitrogen atoms with different numbers of carbon atoms bonded to them. The classification is based on the number of carbon atoms directly bonded to the nitrogen atom.\n\n1. Primary Amines (1°): In primary amines, the nitrogen atom is bonded to one carbon atom and two hydrogen atoms. The general formula for primary amines is RNH2, where R is an alkyl or aryl group. An example of a primary amine is methylamine (CH3NH2).\n\n2. Secondary Amines (2°): In secondary amines, the nitrogen atom is bonded to two carbon atoms and one hydrogen atom. The general formula for secondary amines is R2NH, where R can be the same or different alkyl or aryl groups. An example of a secondary amine is dimethylamine [(CH3)2NH].\n\n3. Tertiary Amines (3°): In tertiary amines, the nitrogen atom is bonded to three carbon atoms and no hydrogen atoms. The general formula for tertiary amines is R3N, where R can be the same or different alkyl or aryl groups. An example of a tertiary amine is trimethylamine [(CH3)3N].\n\nPhysical and Chemical Properties:\n\n1. Boiling Points: Primary amines have higher boiling points than secondary amines, which in turn have higher boiling points than tertiary amines. This is due to the presence of intermolecular hydrogen bonding in primary and secondary amines, which is absent in tertiary amines. The more hydrogen bonding, the higher the boiling point.\n\n2. Solubility: Primary and secondary amines with small alkyl groups are soluble in water due to hydrogen bonding with water molecules. Tertiary amines are less soluble in water as they cannot form hydrogen bonds with water molecules.\n\n3. Basicity: Amines are basic in nature due to the presence of a lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom. The basicity of amines decreases in the order: primary > secondary > tertiary. This is because the electron-donating alkyl groups in secondary and tertiary amines increase the electron density around the nitrogen atom, making it less available for accepting a proton.\n\n4. Reactivity: Primary amines are more reactive than secondary and tertiary amines due to the presence of two hydrogen atoms bonded to the nitrogen atom. They can undergo reactions such as alkylation, acylation, and nucleophilic substitution more readily than secondary and tertiary amines.\n\nIn summary, primary, secondary, and tertiary amines differ in the number of carbon atoms bonded to the nitrogen atom, which affects their physical and chemical properties such as boiling points, solubility, basicity, and reactivity."
