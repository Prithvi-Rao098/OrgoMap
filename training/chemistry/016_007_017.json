    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy of formation of methane (CH4), we need to consider the balanced chemical equation for the formation of methane from its elements in their standard states:\n\nC (graphite) + 2 H2 (g) → CH4 (g)\n\nHowever, the given heat of formation values are not directly related to this equation. Instead, we can use the heat of formation values for CO2 and H2O to find the heat of combustion of methane and then use Hess's Law to find the standard enthalpy of formation of methane.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane is:\n\nCH4 (g) + 2 O2 (g) → CO2 (g) + 2 H2O (l)\n\nUsing the given heat of formation values, we can calculate the heat of combustion (ΔHc°) of methane:\n\nΔHc° = [ΔHf°(CO2) + 2 * ΔHf°(H2O)] - [ΔHf°(CH4) + 2 * ΔHf°(O2)]\n\nSince ΔHf°(O2) = 0 kJ/mol, the equation becomes:\n\nΔHc° = [-393.5 + 2 * (-285.8)] - ΔHf°(CH4)\n\nΔHc° = -965.1 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can use Hess's Law to find the standard enthalpy of formation of methane. The balanced chemical equation for the formation of methane is:\n\nC (graphite) + 2 H2 (g) → CH4 (g)\n\nWe can reverse the combustion equation and divide it by the stoichiometric coefficient of methane (which is 1):\n\nCO2 (g) + 2 H2O (l) → CH4 (g) + 2 O2 (g)\n\nThe reverse reaction has the opposite sign for the heat of combustion:\n\nΔHf°(CH4) = 965.1 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy of formation of methane (CH4) at 25°C and 1 atm pressure is 965.1 kJ/mol."
