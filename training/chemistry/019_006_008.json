    "message_1": "What is the equilibrium constant, Kc, for the following chemical reaction at 25°C? \n\n2NO2(g) ⇌ N2O4(g)\n\nIf the concentration of NO2 at equilibrium is 0.0050 mol/L and the concentration of N2O4 is 0.0100 mol/L, what is the value of Kc for this reaction?",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction, we can use the expression:\n\nKc = [N2O4] / [NO2]^2\n\nGiven the concentrations at equilibrium:\n[NO2] = 0.0050 mol/L\n[N2O4] = 0.0100 mol/L\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Kc expression:\n\nKc = (0.0100) / (0.0050)^2\n\nKc = 0.0100 / 0.000025\n\nKc = 400\n\nSo, the value of Kc for this reaction at 25°C is 400."
