    "message_1": "What is the equilibrium concentration of each species present in a reaction mixture when 1.0 mol of nitrogen gas and 3.0 mol of hydrogen gas are placed in a 2.0 L container and allowed to react to form ammonia gas, assuming that the equilibrium constant for the reaction at that temperature is Kc = 4.34 x 10^-3 ?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table and the equilibrium constant expression. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g)\n\nLet's set up the ICE table:\n\nInitial (M):\n[N2] = 1.0 mol / 2.0 L = 0.5 M\n[H2] = 3.0 mol / 2.0 L = 1.5 M\n[NH3] = 0 M\n\nChange (M):\n[N2] = -x\n[H2] = -3x\n[NH3] = +2x\n\nEquilibrium (M):\n[N2] = 0.5 - x\n[H2] = 1.5 - 3x\n[NH3] = 2x\n\nNow, we can write the equilibrium constant expression:\n\nKc = [NH3]^2 / ([N2] * [H2]^3) = 4.34 x 10^-3\n\nSubstitute the equilibrium concentrations:\n\n4.34 x 10^-3 = (2x)^2 / ((0.5 - x) * (1.5 - 3x)^3)\n\nThis equation is a bit complex to solve algebraically, so we can use an approximation. Since Kc is quite small, we can assume that x is also small, and therefore, the change in concentrations of N2 and H2 is negligible. This means we can approximate the equation as:\n\n4.34 x 10^-3 ≈ (2x)^2 / (0.5 * 1.5^3)\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n4.34 x 10^-3 ≈ (4x^2) / 1.6875\nx^2 ≈ 4.34 x 10^-3 * 1.6875 / 4\nx^2 ≈ 1.834 x 10^-3\nx ≈ √(1.834 x 10^-3)\nx ≈ 0.0428\n\nNow we can find the equilibrium concentrations:\n\n[N2] = 0.5 - x ≈ 0.5 - 0.0428 ≈ 0.4572 M\n[H2] = 1.5 - 3x ≈ 1.5 - 3(0.0428) ≈ 1.3716 M\n[NH3] = 2x ≈ 2(0.0428) ≈ 0.0856 M\n\nSo, the equilibrium concentrations are approximately [N2] = 0.4572 M, [H2] = 1.3716 M, and [NH3] = 0.0856 M."
