    "message_2": "Aspirin, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen are all analgesic and antipyretic drugs, meaning they help relieve pain and reduce fever. However, their mechanisms of action and structural features differ, which contributes to their varying efficacy in treating pain and inflammation.\n\n1. Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid):\nMechanism of action: Aspirin works by irreversibly inhibiting the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, COX-1 and COX-2. These enzymes are responsible for the production of prostaglandins, which are involved in pain, inflammation, and fever. By inhibiting COX enzymes, aspirin reduces the production of prostaglandins, thereby alleviating pain and inflammation.\n\nStructural features: Aspirin has an acetyl group attached to a salicylic acid molecule. The acetyl group is responsible for the acetylation of the COX enzymes, leading to their irreversible inhibition.\n\n2. Ibuprofen:\nMechanism of action: Ibuprofen is a non-selective COX inhibitor, meaning it inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. Like aspirin, this inhibition reduces the production of prostaglandins, which helps alleviate pain and inflammation. However, unlike aspirin, ibuprofen's inhibition of COX enzymes is reversible.\n\nStructural features: Ibuprofen has a propionic acid backbone with a phenyl ring and an isobutyl group. The presence of the phenyl ring and the propionic acid group contribute to its ability to bind to the active site of the COX enzymes, leading to their inhibition.\n\n3. Acetaminophen (paracetamol):\nMechanism of action: The exact mechanism of action of acetaminophen is not fully understood. It is believed to have a weak inhibitory effect on COX enzymes, particularly in the central nervous system, which contributes to its analgesic and antipyretic effects. However, it has little to no anti-inflammatory activity, making it less effective in treating inflammation compared to aspirin and ibuprofen.\n\nStructural features: Acetaminophen has an amide functional group attached to a phenol ring. The presence of the amide group is thought to contribute to its weak COX inhibition, while the phenol group is responsible for its antioxidant properties.\n\nIn summary, aspirin, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen all have analgesic and antipyretic effects, but their mechanisms of action and structural features differ. Aspirin and ibuprofen are more effective in treating inflammation due to their COX enzyme inhibition, while acetaminophen is less effective in this regard but still provides pain relief and fever reduction."
