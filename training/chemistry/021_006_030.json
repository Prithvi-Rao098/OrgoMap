    "message_2": "The dipole moment of a molecule is a measure of its polarity, which is the separation of charge within the molecule. It is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction. To calculate the dipole moment, we need to consider the individual bond dipoles and their directions.\n\nCHCl3, or chloroform, is a tetrahedral molecule with a central carbon atom bonded to one hydrogen atom and three chlorine atoms. The electronegativity difference between carbon (2.55) and hydrogen (2.20) is small, so the C-H bond is considered to be nonpolar. However, the electronegativity difference between carbon and chlorine (3.16) is significant, making the C-Cl bonds polar.\n\nThe three C-Cl bond dipoles are arranged symmetrically around the central carbon atom, and their vector sum determines the overall dipole moment of the molecule. Since the C-Cl bond dipoles are stronger than the C-H bond dipole, the overall dipole moment points towards the center of the three chlorine atoms.\n\nTo calculate the magnitude of the dipole moment, we can use the equation:\n\nμ = Q * d\n\nwhere μ is the dipole moment, Q is the charge difference between the atoms, and d is the distance between the atoms.\n\nHowever, the exact value of the dipole moment for chloroform is determined experimentally, and it is found to be approximately 1.04 D (Debye), where 1 D = 3.336 × 10^(-30) C·m.\n\nIn summary, the dipole moment of CHCl3 is approximately 1.04 D and points towards the center of the three chlorine atoms."
