    "message_2": "To calculate the specific heat capacity of the metal, we can use the formula:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the heat transferred, m is the mass, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nWhen the metal reaches thermal equilibrium with the water, the heat lost by the water is equal to the heat gained by the metal. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\nQ_water = Q_metal\n\nFor water, we know the specific heat capacity (c_water) is 4.18 J/g°C, and the mass of water is 50 grams (since 1 mL of water has a mass of approximately 1 gram). The change in temperature for water (ΔT_water) is the initial temperature (80°C) minus the final temperature (30°C), which is 50°C.\n\nFor the metal, we have the mass (m_metal) as 15 grams, and we need to find the specific heat capacity (c_metal). The change in temperature for the metal (ΔT_metal) is the final temperature (30°C) minus the initial temperature (25°C), which is 5°C.\n\nNow we can set up the equation:\n\nm_water * c_water * ΔT_water = m_metal * c_metal * ΔT_metal\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n50 g * 4.18 J/g°C * 50°C = 15 g * c_metal * 5°C\n\nSolving for c_metal:\n\n(50 * 4.18 * 50) / (15 * 5) = c_metal\n\nc_metal ≈ 0.558 J/g°C\n\nSo, the specific heat capacity of the metal is approximately 0.558 J/g°C."
