    "message_2": "In the compound KMnO4, the oxidation state of manganese can be determined by considering the oxidation states of the other elements in the compound. Potassium (K) has an oxidation state of +1, and oxygen (O) typically has an oxidation state of -2.\n\nThe overall charge of the compound is neutral, so the sum of the oxidation states of all the elements in the compound must equal zero.\n\nLet x be the oxidation state of manganese (Mn). Then, the equation for the sum of the oxidation states is:\n\n(+1) + x + 4(-2) = 0\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx - 7 = 0\n\nx = +7\n\nSo, the oxidation state of manganese in KMnO4 is +7."
