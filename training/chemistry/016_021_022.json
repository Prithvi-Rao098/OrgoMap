    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the polymerization of propylene to polypropylene, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH = Σ ΔH(products) - Σ ΔH(reactants)\n\nIn this case, the reactant is propylene and the product is polypropylene. The enthalpy of formation of propylene is given as -103.8 kJ/mol, and the enthalpy of formation of polypropylene is given as -45.4 kJ/mol.\n\nSince the reaction involves the conversion of one mole of propylene to one mole of polypropylene, the equation becomes:\n\nΔH = (-45.4 kJ/mol) - (-103.8 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH = 58.4 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy change for the polymerization of propylene to polypropylene is 58.4 kJ/mol."
