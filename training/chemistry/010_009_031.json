    "message_2": "To find the resistance of the electrochemical cell, we need to use the Nernst equation, which relates the cell potential to the concentrations of the species involved in the redox reaction. The Nernst equation is:\n\nE_cell = E°_cell - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\n\nwhere E_cell is the cell potential, E°_cell is the standard cell potential, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin (25°C = 298 K), n is the number of electrons transferred in the redox reaction, F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol), and Q is the reaction quotient.\n\nFor the given voltaic cell, the redox reaction is:\n\nCu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Cu(s)\n\nThe standard cell potential (E°_cell) for this reaction is the difference between the standard reduction potentials of the two half-reactions:\n\nE°_cell = E°(Cu²⁺/Cu) - E°(H⁺/H₂) = 0.34 V - 0 V = 0.34 V\n\nThe number of electrons transferred (n) in the redox reaction is 2. The reaction quotient (Q) for this reaction is:\n\nQ = [Cu²⁺]/[H⁺]²\n\nSince the standard hydrogen electrode has a concentration of 1 M for H⁺ ions, and the concentration of Cu²⁺ is given as 0.1 M:\n\nQ = (0.1)/(1)² = 0.1\n\nNow we can plug these values into the Nernst equation:\n\n0.78 V = 0.34 V - (8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K / (2 * 96,485 C/mol)) * ln(0.1)\n\nSolving for the resistance (R) in the equation:\n\nR = ((0.34 V - 0.78 V) * 2 * 96,485 C/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K * ln(0.1))\n\nR ≈ -0.44 * 192,970 C/mol / (2,464.972 J/mol * ln(0.1))\n\nR ≈ -86,179.8 C/mol / (-10,791.7 J/mol)\n\nR ≈ 7.98 Ω\n\nThe resistance of the electrochemical cell is approximately 7.98 ohms."
