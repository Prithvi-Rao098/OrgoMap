    "message_2": "The coordination number of a compound is the number of ligands (atoms, ions, or molecules) that are directly bonded to the central metal atom or ion. In the given compound, [Fe(H2O)6]3+, the central metal atom is Fe (iron), and it is surrounded by six H2O (water) molecules acting as ligands.\n\nTherefore, the coordination number of the compound [Fe(H2O)6]3+ is 6.\n\nThe geometry of a complex with a coordination number of 6 is typically octahedral. In an octahedral geometry, the central metal atom/ion is surrounded by six ligands at equal distances, with 90-degree angles between them. So, the geometry of the complex [Fe(H2O)6]3+ is octahedral."
