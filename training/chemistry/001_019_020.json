    "message_2": "When ethyl bromide (C2H5Br) reacts with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in an ethanol solution, the product formed is ethanol (C2H5OH) and sodium bromide (NaBr). The chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nC2H5Br + NaOH â†’ C2H5OH + NaBr\n\nThis reaction follows an S_N2 (Substitution Nucleophilic Bimolecular) mechanism. In this mechanism, the nucleophile (OH-) attacks the substrate (ethyl bromide) from the backside, leading to the formation of a transition state. The bond between the carbon and the bromine atom weakens, and the bond between the carbon and the oxygen atom of the hydroxide ion strengthens. Finally, the bromide ion (Br-) leaves as a leaving group, and the product ethanol is formed.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of the mechanism:\n\n1. The hydroxide ion (OH-) acts as a nucleophile and approaches the ethyl bromide molecule from the backside, opposite to the bromine atom.\n\n2. A transition state is formed, where the bond between the carbon and the oxygen atom of the hydroxide ion is partially formed, and the bond between the carbon and the bromine atom is partially broken.\n\n3. The bromide ion (Br-) leaves as a leaving group, and the bond between the carbon and the oxygen atom of the hydroxide ion is fully formed.\n\n4. The product, ethanol (C2H5OH), is formed along with sodium bromide (NaBr)."
