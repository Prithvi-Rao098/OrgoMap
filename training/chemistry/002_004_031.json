    "message_1": "What is the pH of a solution containing 0.10 M hydrochloric acid (HCl) and 0.20 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) at 25°C?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to first determine the concentrations of H+ and OH- ions in the solution.\n\nSince hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a strong acid, it will dissociate completely in water, releasing H+ ions. The concentration of H+ ions will be equal to the concentration of HCl, which is 0.10 M.\n\nHCl → H+ + Cl-\n\n[H+] = 0.10 M\n\nSodium hydroxide (NaOH) is a strong base, and it will also dissociate completely in water, releasing OH- ions. The concentration of OH- ions will be equal to the concentration of NaOH, which is 0.20 M.\n\nNaOH → Na+ + OH-\n\n[OH-] = 0.20 M\n\nNow, we need to determine the net concentrations of H+ and OH- ions in the solution. Since there are more OH- ions than H+ ions, the solution will be basic. We can calculate the net concentration of OH- ions by subtracting the concentration of H+ ions from the concentration of OH- ions.\n\n[OH-]net = [OH-] - [H+]\n[OH-]net = 0.20 M - 0.10 M\n[OH-]net = 0.10 M\n\nNow, we can use the ion product of water (Kw) to find the concentration of H+ ions in the solution. At 25°C, Kw = 1.0 x 10^-14.\n\nKw = [H+] x [OH-]\n\nWe can rearrange the equation to solve for [H+]:\n\n[H+] = Kw / [OH-]\n\nSubstitute the values:\n\n[H+] = (1.0 x 10^-14) / (0.10 M)\n[H+] = 1.0 x 10^-13 M\n\nNow that we have the concentration of H+ ions, we can calculate the pH of the solution using the pH formula:\n\npH = -log10[H+]\n\npH = -log10(1.0 x 10^-13)\npH = 13\n\nSo, the pH of the solution is 13, which indicates that it is a strongly basic solution."
