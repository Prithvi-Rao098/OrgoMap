    "message_2": "For C5H12, there are a total of 3 unique isomers considering both alkane and cycloalkane families.\n\n1. Alkane isomers:\nC5H12 is an alkane with the general formula CnH2n+2. There are 3 isomers in the alkane family:\n\na) n-Pentane (straight-chain): CH3-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3\nb) Isopentane (branched): CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3\nc) Neopentane (branched): CH3-C(CH3)3\n\n2. Cycloalkane isomers:\nCycloalkanes have the general formula CnH2n. However, for C5H12, there are no cycloalkane isomers possible because the smallest cycloalkane is cyclopropane (C3H6), and a 5-carbon cycloalkane would have the formula C5H10, not C5H12.\n\nSo, there are a total of 3 unique isomers for C5H12 in the alkane and cycloalkane families."
