    "message_1": "What is the equilibrium constant for the reaction:\n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) â‡Œ 2NH3(g)\n\nif at a certain temperature and pressure, the concentration of N2 is 0.25 M, the concentration of H2 is 0.40 M, and the concentration of NH3 is 1.20 M?",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction, we can use the expression:\n\nKc = [NH3]^2 / ([N2] * [H2]^3)\n\nAt the given temperature and pressure, the concentrations are as follows:\n\n[N2] = 0.25 M\n[H2] = 0.40 M\n[NH3] = 1.20 M\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Kc expression:\n\nKc = (1.20)^2 / (0.25 * (0.40)^3)\n\nKc = 1.44 / (0.25 * 0.064)\n\nKc = 1.44 / 0.016\n\nKc = 90\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction is 90."
