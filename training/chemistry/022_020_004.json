    "message_2": "To determine the activation energy (Ea) for the reaction, we can use the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk = Ae^(-Ea/RT)\n\nwhere k is the rate constant, A is the pre-exponential factor, Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nWe have two sets of data: k1 = 4.5 x 10^-3 M/s at T1 = 300 K and k2 = 9.5 x 10^-3 M/s at T2 = 320 K. We can set up two equations using the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk1 = Ae^(-Ea/RT1)\nk2 = Ae^(-Ea/RT2)\n\nNow, we can divide the first equation by the second equation to eliminate the pre-exponential factor (A):\n\nk1/k2 = e^(-Ea/RT1) / e^(-Ea/RT2)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nk1/k2 = e^(Ea/RT2 - Ea/RT1)\n\nNow, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(k1/k2) = Ea/RT2 - Ea/RT1\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for Ea:\n\nEa = R(T2 - T1) / (ln(k1) - ln(k2))\n\nNow, plug in the given values:\n\nEa = (8.314 J/mol·K)(320 K - 300 K) / (ln(4.5 x 10^-3 M/s) - ln(9.5 x 10^-3 M/s))\n\nEa ≈ (8.314 J/mol·K)(20 K) / (-1.051)\n\nEa ≈ 157.8 J/mol\n\nThe activation energy for the reaction between hydrogen gas and oxygen gas to form water vapor is approximately 157.8 J/mol."
