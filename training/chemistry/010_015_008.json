    "message_1": "A student is studying the overpotential in an electrochemical reaction in a laboratory experiment. The student measures a current of 2.1 A at an electrode potential of -0.6 V, and 1.95 A at -0.5 V. What is the overpotential of the reaction?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the overpotential, we first need to determine the equilibrium potential (E°) of the electrochemical reaction. However, the information provided is not sufficient to determine the equilibrium potential directly. \n\nIn general, overpotential (η) is the difference between the electrode potential (E) and the equilibrium potential (E°):\n\nη = E - E°\n\nGiven the information provided, we can only determine the difference in overpotential between the two measurements:\n\nΔη = (E1 - E°) - (E2 - E°) = E1 - E2\n\nΔη = (-0.6 V) - (-0.5 V) = -0.1 V\n\nThis means that the overpotential has changed by 0.1 V between the two measurements, but we cannot determine the exact overpotential for the reaction without knowing the equilibrium potential (E°). The student would need to provide more information about the electrochemical reaction to determine the overpotential accurately."
