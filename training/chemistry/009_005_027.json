    "message_2": "To find the nuclear binding energy of a helium-4 nucleus, we first need to determine the mass defect. The mass defect is the difference between the mass of the individual nucleons (protons and neutrons) and the mass of the helium-4 nucleus.\n\nMass defect = (Mass of 2 protons and 2 neutrons) - (Mass of helium-4 nucleus)\nMass defect = 4.03188 amu - 4.00150 amu\nMass defect = 0.03038 amu\n\nNow, we need to convert the mass defect from atomic mass units (amu) to energy using Einstein's famous equation, E=mc², where E is the energy, m is the mass, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum (approximately 3.00 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass defect from amu to kilograms. 1 amu is equal to 1.66054 x 10^-27 kg.\n\nMass defect (in kg) = 0.03038 amu * (1.66054 x 10^-27 kg/amu)\nMass defect (in kg) = 5.045 x 10^-29 kg\n\nNow, we can use the E=mc² equation to find the binding energy.\n\nE = (5.045 x 10^-29 kg) * (3.00 x 10^8 m/s)²\nE = 5.045 x 10^-29 kg * 9.00 x 10^16 m²/s²\nE = 4.540 x 10^-12 kg m²/s²\n\nSince 1 Joule is equal to 1 kg m²/s², the binding energy is:\n\nE = 4.540 x 10^-12 Joules\n\nHowever, it is more common to express nuclear binding energies in units of mega-electron volts (MeV). To convert Joules to MeV, we use the conversion factor 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J.\n\nE = (4.540 x 10^-12 J) / (1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV)\nE = 2.834 x 10^7 eV\n\nNow, we convert eV to MeV by dividing by 1,000,000 (since 1 MeV = 1,000,000 eV).\n\nE = 2.834 x 10^7 eV / 1,000,000\nE = 28.34 MeV\n\nSo, the nuclear binding energy of a helium-4 nucleus is approximately 28.34 MeV."
