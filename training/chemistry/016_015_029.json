    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat released when 25 g of NaCl is crystallized, we can use the formula:\n\nq = m × ΔH\n\nwhere q is the heat released, m is the mass of NaCl, and ΔH is the heat of crystallization.\n\nGiven:\nm = 25 g (mass of NaCl)\nΔH = -788 J/g (heat of crystallization of NaCl)\n\nNow, plug in the values:\n\nq = 25 g × (-788 J/g)\n\nq = -19700 J\n\nThe amount of heat released when 25 g of NaCl is crystallized from a solution at its saturation point is -19,700 J. The negative sign indicates that the heat is released (exothermic process)."
