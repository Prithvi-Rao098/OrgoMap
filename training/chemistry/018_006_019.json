    "message_2": "The addition of a catalyst to the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide significantly increases the rate of the reaction. A catalyst is a substance that speeds up a chemical reaction without being consumed or permanently altered in the process. In the case of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) decomposition, the reaction can be slow at room temperature. However, when a catalyst is added, the reaction rate increases dramatically.\n\nOne common catalyst used for this reaction is manganese dioxide (MnO2). When added to hydrogen peroxide, it lowers the activation energy required for the decomposition reaction to occur. This allows the reaction to proceed at a much faster rate, producing oxygen gas (O2) and water (H2O) as products.\n\nThe overall reaction can be represented as:\n\n2H2O2 (aq) â†’ 2H2O (l) + O2 (g)\n\nIn the presence of a catalyst, the hydrogen peroxide molecules are more likely to collide with the catalyst's surface, where the decomposition reaction can occur more easily. This increased likelihood of successful collisions leads to a faster reaction rate.\n\nIt is important to note that the catalyst does not change the overall thermodynamics of the reaction, meaning that the products and reactants remain the same. The catalyst simply provides an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy, allowing the reaction to proceed more quickly."
