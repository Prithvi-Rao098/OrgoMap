    "message_2": "To find the heat capacity of the water, we can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat energy absorbed (in joules), m is the mass of the water (in grams), c is the specific heat capacity of water (4.18 J/g°C), and ΔT is the change in temperature (in °C).\n\nWe are given the mass of water (m = 10 g), the initial temperature (20°C), the final temperature (30°C), and the heat energy absorbed (q = 500 J). We can find the change in temperature (ΔT) by subtracting the initial temperature from the final temperature:\n\nΔT = 30°C - 20°C = 10°C\n\nNow we can plug the values into the formula and solve for the specific heat capacity (c):\n\n500 J = (10 g) * c * (10°C)\n\n500 J = 100 g°C * c\n\nc = 500 J / 100 g°C\n\nc = 5 J/g°C\n\nThe heat capacity of the 10 grams of water is 5 J/g°C. However, this value is not consistent with the known specific heat capacity of water, which is 4.18 J/g°C. There might be an error in the given information or the water might not be pure."
