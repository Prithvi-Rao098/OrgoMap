    "message_1": "What volume of hydrogen gas will be produced at STP when reacting 3.5 grams of aluminum with excess hydrochloric acid according to the balanced chemical equation: 2Al(s) + 6HCl(aq) → 2AlCl3(aq) + 3H2(g) ?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the mass of aluminum (Al) to moles using its molar mass.\n2. Determine the mole ratio between aluminum and hydrogen gas (H2) from the balanced chemical equation.\n3. Calculate the moles of hydrogen gas produced.\n4. Convert the moles of hydrogen gas to volume at STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure).\n\nStep 1: Convert the mass of aluminum to moles\nMolar mass of Al = 26.98 g/mol\nMass of Al = 3.5 g\n\nMoles of Al = mass of Al / molar mass of Al\nMoles of Al = 3.5 g / 26.98 g/mol = 0.1297 mol\n\nStep 2: Determine the mole ratio between Al and H2\nFrom the balanced chemical equation, the mole ratio between Al and H2 is 2:3.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the moles of hydrogen gas produced\nUsing the mole ratio, we can determine the moles of H2 produced:\n\nMoles of H2 = (moles of Al × mole ratio of H2) / mole ratio of Al\nMoles of H2 = (0.1297 mol × 3) / 2 = 0.1946 mol\n\nStep 4: Convert the moles of hydrogen gas to volume at STP\nAt STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure: 0°C and 1 atm), 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n\nVolume of H2 = moles of H2 × volume per mole at STP\nVolume of H2 = 0.1946 mol × 22.4 L/mol = 4.36 L\n\nTherefore, 4.36 liters of hydrogen gas will be produced when 3.5 grams of aluminum reacts with excess hydrochloric acid at STP."
