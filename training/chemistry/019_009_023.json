    "message_2": "To calculate the standard free energy change (ΔG°) for the redox reaction, we first need to determine the overall cell potential (E°) for the reaction. The cell potential is the difference between the standard reduction potentials of the two half-reactions.\n\nThe given reaction can be divided into two half-reactions:\n\n1. Ag⁺(aq) + e⁻ → Ag(s) (Reduction half-reaction)\n2. Cu(s) → Cu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ (Oxidation half-reaction)\n\nThe standard reduction potential (E°) for the reduction half-reaction is given as +0.80 V, and the standard reduction potential for the oxidation half-reaction is given as +0.34 V. However, we need to reverse the oxidation half-reaction to find its standard oxidation potential:\n\nCu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Cu(s)\n\nThe standard oxidation potential for the reversed reaction is -0.34 V.\n\nNow, we can calculate the overall cell potential (E°) for the redox reaction:\n\nE° = E°(reduction) - E°(oxidation)\nE° = (+0.80 V) - (-0.34 V)\nE° = +1.14 V\n\nNext, we can use the relationship between the standard free energy change (ΔG°) and the cell potential (E°) to calculate ΔG°:\n\nΔG° = -nFE°\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the reaction, F is Faraday's constant (96,485 C/mol), and E° is the cell potential.\n\nIn this reaction, 2 moles of electrons are transferred (from Cu to Ag⁺). Therefore, n = 2.\n\nΔG° = -(2 mol)(96,485 C/mol)(1.14 V)\nΔG° = -219,664.6 J/mol\n\nSince the standard free energy change is typically expressed in kJ/mol, we can convert the value:\n\nΔG° = -219.7 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard free energy change (ΔG°) for the given redox reaction is -219.7 kJ/mol."
