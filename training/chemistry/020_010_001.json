    "message_1": "What is the effect on the equilibrium position of a solution containing 0.1 M of acetic acid and 0.2 M of sodium acetate if an additional 0.1 M of sodium acetate is added to the solution? Calculate the new pH of the solution after this addition. (Assume that the dissociation constant of acetic acid is 1.8 x 10^-5)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n\nwhere pH is the pH of the solution, pKa is the negative logarithm of the dissociation constant (Ka) of the weak acid, [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base, and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid.\n\nFirst, we need to find the pKa of acetic acid:\n\npKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.8 x 10^-5) ≈ 4.74\n\nNow, we need to find the new concentrations of the acetic acid and its conjugate base after the addition of 0.1 M of sodium acetate. Since sodium acetate is a strong electrolyte, it will dissociate completely in the solution, increasing the concentration of the acetate ion (A-) by 0.1 M:\n\nInitial concentrations:\n[HA] = 0.1 M (acetic acid)\n[A-] = 0.2 M (sodium acetate)\n\nAfter adding 0.1 M of sodium acetate:\n[HA] = 0.1 M (acetic acid)\n[A-] = 0.2 M + 0.1 M = 0.3 M (sodium acetate)\n\nNow we can plug these values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = 4.74 + log(0.3/0.1) = 4.74 + log(3) ≈ 4.74 + 0.48 ≈ 5.22\n\nSo, after adding 0.1 M of sodium acetate to the solution, the new pH of the solution is approximately 5.22. The equilibrium position has shifted towards the right, favoring the formation of more acetic acid and hydroxide ions."
