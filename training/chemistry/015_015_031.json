    "message_2": "The absorption of light by a molecule leads to photochemical reactions and influences its photophysical properties through a series of processes that involve the promotion of electrons to higher energy levels and the subsequent relaxation of these excited states. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the process:\n\n1. Absorption of light: When a molecule absorbs a photon of light, its energy increases, and one of its electrons is promoted from the ground state to a higher-energy excited state. This process is called electronic excitation. The energy of the absorbed photon must match the energy difference between the ground state and the excited state for the transition to occur.\n\n2. Excited states: The excited state of a molecule is generally less stable than the ground state. The molecule can exist in various excited states, depending on the energy of the absorbed photon. These states are often represented as singlet or triplet states, depending on the spin multiplicity of the excited electron.\n\n3. Relaxation processes: Once the molecule is in an excited state, it can undergo several relaxation processes to return to the ground state. These processes include:\n\n   a. Internal conversion: The molecule can undergo vibrational relaxation, where the excess energy is dissipated as heat through molecular vibrations. This process is non-radiative and does not involve the emission of light.\n\n   b. Fluorescence: The molecule can return to the ground state by emitting a photon of lower energy than the absorbed photon. This process is called fluorescence and is a radiative process. The emitted light typically has a longer wavelength than the absorbed light, resulting in a phenomenon called the Stokes shift.\n\n   c. Intersystem crossing: The molecule can undergo a spin-flip transition, converting from a singlet excited state to a triplet excited state. This process is non-radiative and involves a change in the electron's spin multiplicity.\n\n   d. Phosphorescence: The molecule in the triplet excited state can return to the ground state by emitting a photon. This process is called phosphorescence and is a radiative process. Phosphorescence typically occurs at even longer wavelengths than fluorescence and has a longer lifetime.\n\n4. Photochemical reactions: In some cases, the excited state of a molecule can undergo chemical reactions that are not possible in the ground state. These reactions are called photochemical reactions and can lead to the formation of new products or the rearrangement of the molecular structure. Examples of photochemical reactions include photosynthesis, photodegradation, and photoisomerization.\n\nIn summary, the absorption of light by a molecule leads to electronic excitation and the formation of excited states. The relaxation of these excited states through various processes influences the photophysical properties of the molecule, such as its fluorescence and phosphorescence. Additionally, the excited states can undergo photochemical reactions, leading to new products or changes in the molecular structure."
