    "message_2": "To determine the polarization in the electrochemical cell, we need to calculate the cell potential under non-standard conditions using the Nernst equation. The standard reduction potentials for the half-reactions are:\n\nZn²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Zn(s)  E° = -0.76 V\nCu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu(s)  E° = +0.34 V\n\nThe overall cell reaction is:\nZn(s) + Cu²⁺ → Zn²⁺ + Cu(s)\n\nThe standard cell potential (E°cell) is the difference between the standard reduction potentials of the two half-reactions:\nE°cell = E°(Cu²⁺/Cu) - E°(Zn²⁺/Zn) = 0.34 V - (-0.76 V) = 1.10 V\n\nNow, we can use the Nernst equation to find the cell potential under non-standard conditions:\n\nEcell = E°cell - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\n\nwhere:\nEcell = cell potential under non-standard conditions\nR = gas constant = 8.314 J/(mol·K)\nT = temperature = 25°C = 298.15 K\nn = number of moles of electrons transferred = 2 (since both half-reactions involve 2 electrons)\nF = Faraday's constant = 96485 C/mol\nQ = reaction quotient = [Zn²⁺]/[Cu²⁺]\n\nGiven the concentrations of Zn²⁺ and Cu²⁺ are both 0.1 M, the reaction quotient (Q) is:\n\nQ = [Zn²⁺]/[Cu²⁺] = (0.1)/(0.1) = 1\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Nernst equation:\n\nEcell = 1.10 V - (8.314 J/(mol·K) * 298.15 K / (2 * 96485 C/mol)) * ln(1)\nEcell = 1.10 V - 0\n\nSince ln(1) = 0, the cell potential under non-standard conditions is equal to the standard cell potential:\n\nEcell = 1.10 V\n\nThe polarization in the electrochemical cell is the difference between the standard cell potential and the cell potential under non-standard conditions. In this case, the polarization is:\n\nPolarization = E°cell - Ecell = 1.10 V - 1.10 V = 0 V\n\nTherefore, the polarization in this electrochemical cell is 0 V."
