The reaction is balanced and the standard entropy values for methane, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water vapor are given as -0.242, 205.16, 213.74, and 188.72 J/K/mol, respectively.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the entropy change for the reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔS_reaction = Σn_products * S_products - Σn_reactants * S_reactants\n\nwhere ΔS_reaction is the entropy change for the reaction, n is the number of moles of each substance, and S is the standard entropy value for each substance.\n\nThe balanced reaction is:\n\n2 CH4 (g) + 4 O2 (g) → 2 CO2 (g) + 4 H2O (g)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for the moles and standard entropy values for each substance:\n\nΔS_reaction = [(2 * 213.74) + (4 * 188.72)] - [(2 * (-0.242)) + (4 * 205.16)]\n\nΔS_reaction = [(427.48) + (754.88)] - [(0.484) + (820.64)]\n\nΔS_reaction = 1182.36 - 821.124\n\nΔS_reaction = 361.236 J/K\n\nThe entropy change for the reaction of 2 moles of methane gas reacting with 4 moles of oxygen gas to form carbon dioxide gas and water vapor at a constant temperature of 298 K is 361.236 J/K."
