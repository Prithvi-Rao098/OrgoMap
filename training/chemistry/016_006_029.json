    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of reaction for the combustion of methane gas (CH4), we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nCH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(g)\n\nNext, we will use Hess's Law, which states that the enthalpy change of a reaction is the sum of the enthalpy changes of formation of the products minus the sum of the enthalpy changes of formation of the reactants.\n\nΔH_reaction = [ΔHfº(CO2) + 2 * ΔHfº(H2O)] - [ΔHfº(CH4) + 2 * ΔHfº(O2)]\n\nSince O2 is in its standard state, its enthalpy of formation (ΔHfº) is 0 kJ/mol. Now, we can plug in the given values:\n\nΔH_reaction = [(-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 * (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [(-74.6 kJ/mol) + 2 * (0 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH_reaction = (-393.5 - 571.6 + 74.6) kJ/mol\n\nΔH_reaction = -890.5 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy of reaction for the combustion of methane gas (CH4) is -890.5 kJ/mol."
