    "message_1": "What is the equilibrium constant for the dissociation of the weak acid, acetic acid (CH3COOH), given its concentration is 0.1 M and the concentration of its conjugate base, acetate ion (CH3COO-), is 0.02 M at equilibrium? The dissociation reaction is CH3COOH ⇋ H+ + CH3COO-.",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Ka) for the dissociation of acetic acid, we can use the equilibrium expression:\n\nKa = [H+][CH3COO-] / [CH3COOH]\n\nAt equilibrium, the concentration of acetic acid (CH3COOH) is 0.1 M - 0.02 M = 0.08 M, since 0.02 M of it has dissociated into acetate ions (CH3COO-). The concentration of acetate ions is given as 0.02 M. Since acetic acid is a weak acid, we can assume that the concentration of H+ ions is equal to the concentration of acetate ions, which is also 0.02 M.\n\nNow we can plug these values into the equilibrium expression:\n\nKa = (0.02)(0.02) / 0.08\n\nKa = 0.0004 / 0.08\n\nKa ≈ 0.005\n\nThe equilibrium constant for the dissociation of acetic acid is approximately 0.005."
