    "message_2": "To determine the boiling temperature of the solution, we need to calculate the molality of the solution and then use the boiling point elevation formula. \n\nFirst, let's find the molality of the solution. Molality (m) is defined as the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent.\n\nMolality (m) = (moles of solute) / (mass of solvent in kg)\n\nSince the solvent is water, we know that 1 liter of water has a mass of 1 kg. The total moles of solute are 0.5 moles of glucose + 0.5 moles of sucrose = 1 mole.\n\nMolality (m) = (1 mole) / (1 kg) = 1 mol/kg\n\nNow, we can use the boiling point elevation formula:\n\nΔTb = Kb * m\n\nwhere ΔTb is the change in boiling temperature, Kb is the boiling point elevation constant for water, and m is the molality of the solution.\n\nThe boiling point elevation constant (Kb) for water is 0.512 °C/mol/kg.\n\nΔTb = (0.512 °C/mol/kg) * (1 mol/kg) = 0.512 °C\n\nNow, we need to add this change in boiling temperature to the normal boiling point of water at atmospheric pressure, which is 100 °C.\n\nBoiling temperature of the solution = 100 °C + 0.512 °C = 100.512 °C\n\nTherefore, the boiling temperature of the solution containing 0.5 moles of glucose and 0.5 moles of sucrose in 1 liter of water at atmospheric pressure is approximately 100.512 °C."
