    "message_1": "What will be the effect on the formation of complex ion [Fe(CN)₆]4- when the concentration of cyanide ion is increased in the equilibrium system consisting of Fe3+ and CN- ions? Calculate the equilibrium constant of the reaction if the initial molar concentration of Fe3+ ion and cyanide ion is 0.1M and 0.05M, respectively.",
    "message_2": "When the concentration of cyanide ion (CN-) is increased in the equilibrium system, the formation of the complex ion [Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻ will also increase according to Le Chatelier's principle. This principle states that when a change is applied to a system at equilibrium, the system will adjust itself to counteract the change and restore equilibrium.\n\nThe reaction for the formation of the complex ion [Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻ is:\n\nFe³⁺ + 6CN⁻ ⇌ [Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻\n\nTo calculate the equilibrium constant (K) of the reaction, we can use the initial molar concentrations of Fe³⁺ and CN⁻ ions and the equilibrium concentrations of the species involved in the reaction. However, we do not have enough information to directly calculate the equilibrium concentrations.\n\nInstead, we can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to represent the changes in concentrations during the reaction:\n\n```\n          [Fe³⁺]   [CN⁻]   [[Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻]\nInitial:   0.1      0.05      0\nChange:    -x       -6x       +x\nEquilibrium: 0.1-x   0.05-6x   x\n```\n\nWhere x represents the change in concentration of the species during the reaction. The equilibrium constant K can be expressed as:\n\nK = [ [Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻ ] / ( [Fe³⁺] * [CN⁻]⁶ )\n\nSubstituting the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table:\n\nK = (x) / ((0.1-x) * (0.05-6x)⁶)\n\nUnfortunately, without knowing the value of K or having additional information about the equilibrium concentrations, we cannot solve for x and calculate the equilibrium constant for this reaction."
