    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy of formation of methane (ΔHf° CH4), we can use the balanced combustion reaction and the given information:\n\nCH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l)\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for this reaction (ΔH°) is given as -890.4 kJ/mol. We also know the standard enthalpy of formation for H2O(l) and CO2(g), which are -285.8 kJ/mol and -393.5 kJ/mol, respectively.\n\nUsing Hess's Law, we can write the equation for the standard enthalpy change of the reaction:\n\nΔH° = [ΔHf°(CO2) + 2 * ΔHf°(H2O)] - [ΔHf°(CH4) + 2 * ΔHf°(O2)]\n\nSince the standard enthalpy of formation for an element in its standard state is zero, ΔHf°(O2) = 0. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n-890.4 kJ/mol = [-393.5 kJ/mol + 2 * (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - ΔHf°(CH4)\n\nNow, we can solve for ΔHf°(CH4):\n\n-890.4 kJ/mol = (-393.5 - 571.6) kJ/mol - ΔHf°(CH4)\n-890.4 kJ/mol = -965.1 kJ/mol - ΔHf°(CH4)\n\nΔHf°(CH4) = -965.1 kJ/mol + 890.4 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(CH4) = -74.7 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation of methane, CH4(g), is -74.7 kJ/mol."
