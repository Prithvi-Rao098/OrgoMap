    "message_2": "The molecular geometry of a water molecule (H2O) is bent or V-shaped. This is due to the presence of two lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen atom, which repel the bonding pairs of electrons, causing the molecule to adopt a bent geometry. The bond angle between the hydrogen-oxygen-hydrogen atoms in a water molecule is approximately 104.5 degrees."
