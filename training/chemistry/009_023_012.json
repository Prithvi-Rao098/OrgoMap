    "message_2": "The half-life of technetium-99m used in medical imaging is approximately 6 hours.\n\nTo determine how many days it will take for a sample containing 100 milligrams of technetium-99m to decay to 25 milligrams, we can use the formula:\n\nFinal amount = Initial amount * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, we want to find the time elapsed when the final amount is 25 milligrams and the initial amount is 100 milligrams. So,\n\n25 = 100 * (1/2)^(time elapsed / 6 hours)\n\n0.25 = (1/2)^(time elapsed / 6 hours)\n\nTaking the logarithm of both sides:\n\nlog(0.25) = (time elapsed / 6 hours) * log(1/2)\n\nNow, we can solve for the time elapsed:\n\ntime elapsed = 6 hours * log(0.25) / log(1/2)\ntime elapsed â‰ˆ 12 hours\n\nSo, it will take approximately 12 hours for a sample containing 100 milligrams of technetium-99m to decay to 25 milligrams.\n\nAfter 3 half-lives, the radioactive decay can be calculated using the same formula:\n\nFinal amount = Initial amount * (1/2)^(number of half-lives)\n\nFinal amount = 100 * (1/2)^3\nFinal amount = 100 * (1/8)\nFinal amount = 12.5 milligrams\n\nSo, after 3 half-lives, 12.5 milligrams of the original 100 milligrams of technetium-99m remain, meaning that 87.5 milligrams have undergone radioactive decay."
