    "message_2": "In a single replacement reaction between silver nitrate (AgNO3) solution and copper (Cu) metal, copper will replace silver in the silver nitrate compound, resulting in the formation of copper nitrate (Cu(NO3)2) and silver (Ag) metal.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\n2AgNO3(aq) + Cu(s) â†’ Cu(NO3)2(aq) + 2Ag(s)\n\nThis reaction will occur because copper is more reactive than silver, and it can displace silver from its compound."
