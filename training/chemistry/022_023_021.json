    "message_2": "To find the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid (CH3COOH) with a Ka of 1.8x10^-5, we can use the formula for the ionization constant of a weak acid:\n\nKa = [H+][A-]/[HA]\n\nIn this case, Ka = 1.8x10^-5, and the initial concentration of acetic acid, [HA], is 0.1 M. Since the solution is initially pure acetic acid, the initial concentrations of [H+] and [A-] are both 0.\n\nAs the acetic acid ionizes, the concentrations of [H+] and [A-] will increase by x, while the concentration of [HA] will decrease by x. So, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n1.8x10^-5 = (x)(x)/(0.1 - x)\n\nSince Ka is very small, we can assume that x is much smaller than 0.1, so we can simplify the equation to:\n\n1.8x10^-5 ≈ x^2/0.1\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx^2 = 1.8x10^-5 * 0.1\nx^2 = 1.8x10^-6\nx ≈ 1.34x10^-3\n\nSince x represents the concentration of [H+], we can now calculate the pH using the formula:\n\npH = -log[H+]\npH = -log(1.34x10^-3)\npH ≈ 2.87\n\nSo, the pH of the 0.1 M solution of acetic acid is approximately 2.87."
