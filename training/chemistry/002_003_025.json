    "message_1": "What is the solubility of barium sulfate (BaSO4) in water at room temperature?",
    "message_2": "The solubility of barium sulfate (BaSO4) in water at room temperature (25Â°C) is very low. It is approximately 2.4 mg/L or 2.4 ppm (parts per million). This means that only about 2.4 milligrams of BaSO4 will dissolve in 1 liter of water at room temperature. Barium sulfate is considered to be an insoluble salt due to its extremely low solubility."
