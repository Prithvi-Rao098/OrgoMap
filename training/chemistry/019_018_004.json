    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the phase transition reaction of solid water (ice) at -10°C into liquid water at 25°C, we need to consider three steps:\n\n1. Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C\n2. Melting the ice at 0°C\n3. Heating the liquid water from 0°C to 25°C\n\nFirst, let's calculate the enthalpy change for each step:\n\n1. Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C:\nq1 = mass × specific heat capacity of ice × temperature change\nq1 = m × 2.09 J/g°C × (0 - (-10)) °C\nq1 = 20.9 m J (where m is the mass of water in grams)\n\n2. Melting the ice at 0°C:\nq2 = moles × enthalpy of fusion\nq2 = (m/18.015) mol × 6.01 kJ/mol\nq2 = 0.3335 m kJ\n\n3. Heating the liquid water from 0°C to 25°C:\nq3 = mass × specific heat capacity of liquid water × temperature change\nq3 = m × 4.18 J/g°C × (25 - 0) °C\nq3 = 104.5 m J\n\nNow, let's add the enthalpy changes for all three steps to find the total standard enthalpy change:\n\nTotal enthalpy change = q1 + q2 + q3\nTotal enthalpy change = 20.9 m J + 0.3335 m kJ + 104.5 m J\nTotal enthalpy change = (20.9 + 104.5) m J + 0.3335 m kJ\nTotal enthalpy change = 125.4 m J + 0.3335 m kJ\n\nTo convert the enthalpy change in kJ, divide by 1000:\n\nTotal enthalpy change = 0.1254 m kJ + 0.3335 m kJ\nTotal enthalpy change = 0.4589 m kJ\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change for the phase transition reaction of solid water (ice) at -10°C into liquid water at 25°C is 0.4589 m kJ, where m is the mass of water in grams."
