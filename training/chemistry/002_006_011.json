    "message_2": "To calculate the molar mass of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), we need to add the molar masses of each element present in the compound.\n\nCalcium (Ca): 1 atom × 40.08 g/mol = 40.08 g/mol\nCarbon (C): 1 atom × 12.01 g/mol = 12.01 g/mol\nOxygen (O): 3 atoms × 16.00 g/mol = 48.00 g/mol\n\nNow, add the molar masses of each element:\n\n40.08 g/mol (Ca) + 12.01 g/mol (C) + 48.00 g/mol (O) = 100.09 g/mol\n\nThe molar mass of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) is approximately 100.09 g/mol."
