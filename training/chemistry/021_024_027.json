    "message_2": "To determine the bond order of the oxygen molecule (O2) using molecular orbital theory, we first need to know the electronic configuration of oxygen and then fill the molecular orbitals accordingly.\n\nOxygen has an atomic number of 8, which means it has 8 electrons. In O2, there are two oxygen atoms, so there are a total of 16 electrons. Now, we need to fill these electrons in the molecular orbitals following the Aufbau principle, Pauli exclusion principle, and Hund's rule.\n\nThe order of molecular orbitals for O2 is as follows:\n1. σ1s\n2. σ*1s\n3. σ2s\n4. σ*2s\n5. π2px and π2py (degenerate orbitals)\n6. π*2px and π*2py (degenerate orbitals)\n7. σ2pz\n8. σ*2pz\n\nNow, let's fill the 16 electrons in these orbitals:\n\n1. σ1s: 2 electrons\n2. σ*1s: 2 electrons\n3. σ2s: 2 electrons\n4. σ*2s: 2 electrons\n5. π2px: 2 electrons\n6. π2py: 2 electrons\n7. π*2px: 2 electrons\n8. π*2py: 2 electrons\n\nNow, we can calculate the bond order using the formula:\n\nBond order = (Number of electrons in bonding orbitals - Number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\n\nBonding orbitals: σ1s (2), σ2s (2), π2px (2), π2py (2)\nAntibonding orbitals: σ*1s (2), σ*2s (2), π*2px (2), π*2py (2)\n\nBond order = (2 + 2 + 2 + 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2) / 2\nBond order = (8 - 8) / 2\nBond order = 0 / 2\nBond order = 0\n\nHowever, this result is incorrect, as we know that O2 exists and has a bond order greater than 0. The mistake lies in the fact that we filled the π*2px and π*2py orbitals before the σ2pz orbital. In reality, the σ2pz orbital is lower in energy than the π*2px and π*2py orbitals for O2. So, let's correct the electron filling:\n\n1. σ1s: 2 electrons\n2. σ*1s: 2 electrons\n3. σ2s: 2 electrons\n4. σ*2s: 2 electrons\n5. π2px: 2 electrons\n6. π2py: 2 electrons\n7. σ2pz: 2 electrons\n8. π*2px: 1 electron\n9. π*2py: 1 electron\n\nNow, let's recalculate the bond order:\n\nBond order = (Number of electrons in bonding orbitals - Number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\n\nBonding orbitals: σ1s (2), σ2s (2), π2px (2), π2py (2), σ2pz (2)\nAntibonding orbitals: σ*1s (2), σ*2s (2), π*2px (1), π*2py (1)\n\nBond order = (2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 - 2 - 2 - 1 - 1) / 2\nBond order = (10 - 6) / 2\nBond order = 4 / 2\nBond order = 2\n\nSo, the bond order of the oxygen molecule (O2) using molecular orbital theory is 2. This means that there is a double bond between the two oxygen atoms in O2."
