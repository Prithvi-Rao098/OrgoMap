    "message_2": "Ionic, covalent, and metallic solids are three main types of inorganic solids, each with distinct physical properties and bonding characteristics. Here are the key differences between them:\n\n1. Ionic solids:\n- Bonding: Ionic solids consist of positively charged cations and negatively charged anions held together by strong electrostatic forces (ionic bonds).\n- Structure: They typically form crystalline structures, such as a lattice, where the ions are arranged in a repeating pattern.\n- Physical properties: Ionic solids have high melting and boiling points due to the strong ionic bonds. They are generally hard and brittle. In their solid state, they are poor conductors of electricity, but when dissolved in water or melted, they become good conductors due to the mobility of the ions.\n- Example: Sodium chloride (NaCl) is an ionic solid. It has a high melting point (801°C) and forms a crystalline structure. When dissolved in water, it conducts electricity.\n\n2. Covalent solids:\n- Bonding: Covalent solids consist of atoms bonded together by sharing electrons, forming covalent bonds.\n- Structure: They can be found in two forms: molecular solids and network covalent solids. Molecular solids have discrete molecules held together by weak intermolecular forces, while network covalent solids have an extended network of covalently bonded atoms.\n- Physical properties: Molecular solids have low melting and boiling points due to weak intermolecular forces. They are generally soft and poor conductors of electricity. Network covalent solids, on the other hand, have high melting and boiling points due to the strong covalent bonds. They are hard and poor conductors of electricity.\n- Example: Diamond is a network covalent solid made of carbon atoms covalently bonded in a tetrahedral arrangement. It has a very high melting point (sublimation at 3915°C) and is an excellent insulator.\n\n3. Metallic solids:\n- Bonding: Metallic solids consist of metal atoms bonded together by a \"sea\" of delocalized electrons, forming metallic bonds.\n- Structure: They have a regular arrangement of metal atoms surrounded by the delocalized electrons.\n- Physical properties: Metallic solids have variable melting and boiling points, depending on the strength of the metallic bonds. They are generally malleable, ductile, and good conductors of electricity and heat due to the mobility of the delocalized electrons.\n- Example: Copper (Cu) is a metallic solid. It has a relatively high melting point (1085°C) and is an excellent conductor of electricity and heat.\n\nTo identify the type of inorganic solid a substance belongs to, consider the following:\n\n- If the substance consists of a metal and a non-metal, it is likely an ionic solid.\n- If the substance consists of only non-metals, it could be a covalent solid. Check if it forms discrete molecules (molecular solid) or an extended network (network covalent solid).\n- If the substance consists of only metals, it is likely a metallic solid.\n\nAdditionally, consider the physical properties of the substance, such as melting point, hardness, and electrical conductivity, to further confirm its classification."
