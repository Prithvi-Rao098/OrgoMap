    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic moment of a coordination compound containing cobalt (II) ion with four coordinated chloride ligands in a square planar geometry, we need to consider the electron configuration of the central metal ion and the crystal field splitting.\n\nCobalt (II) ion has an electron configuration of [Ar] 3d7 4s0. In a square planar geometry, the crystal field splitting of the d orbitals results in two groups: the lower energy dxy, dyz, and dxz orbitals (t2g), and the higher energy dx2-y2 and dz2 orbitals (eg).\n\nFor a square planar complex, the ligand field splitting energy is large enough that the electrons will fill the lower energy t2g orbitals before occupying the higher energy eg orbitals. In the case of cobalt (II), there are 7 electrons in the 3d orbitals. The first 5 electrons will fill the t2g orbitals, and the remaining 2 electrons will occupy the eg orbitals.\n\nThe magnetic moment (μ) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nμ = √(n(n+2))\n\nwhere n is the number of unpaired electrons.\n\nIn this case, there are 2 unpaired electrons in the eg orbitals.\n\nμ = √(2(2+2))\nμ = √(2(4))\nμ = √8\nμ ≈ 2.83 Bohr magnetons\n\nSo, the magnetic moment of the coordination compound containing cobalt (II) ion with four coordinated chloride ligands in a square planar geometry is approximately 2.83 Bohr magnetons."
