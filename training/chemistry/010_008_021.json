    "message_1": "What is the current density (in A/cm²) of a zinc half-cell in a copper-zinc electrochemical cell given the following conditions: The copper electrode has a surface area of 20 cm² and a current of 2 A is generated when the cell is operating. The standard reduction potential of Cu²⁺/Cu is 0.34 V and the standard reduction potential of Zn²⁺/Zn is -0.76 V. The concentration of Zn²⁺ is 0.01 M and the concentration of Cu²⁺ is 1 M. Assume the temperature is constant at 25°C.",
    "message_2": "To find the current density of the zinc half-cell, we first need to determine the surface area of the zinc electrode. Since the current generated by the cell is 2 A and the current density is the same for both half-cells, we can use the copper electrode's surface area and current to find the current density.\n\nCurrent density (J) = Current (I) / Surface area (A)\n\nFor the copper electrode:\nJ_Cu = 2 A / 20 cm² = 0.1 A/cm²\n\nSince the current density is the same for both half-cells, the current density of the zinc half-cell is also 0.1 A/cm²."
