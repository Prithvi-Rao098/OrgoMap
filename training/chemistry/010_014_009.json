    "message_1": "What is the mass of copper deposited on a cathode when a current of 2.5 A is passed through a copper (II) sulfate solution for 30 minutes? (Given: The atomic mass of copper is 63.55 g/mol and the charge on 1 mole of electrons is 96,487 C/mol)",
    "message_2": "To find the mass of copper deposited on the cathode, we can use Faraday's law of electrolysis. First, we need to find the total charge passed through the solution.\n\nTotal charge (Q) = Current (I) × Time (t)\nGiven current (I) = 2.5 A and time (t) = 30 minutes = 1800 seconds (since 1 minute = 60 seconds)\n\nQ = 2.5 A × 1800 s = 4500 C\n\nNow, we need to find the number of moles of electrons (n) involved in this process.\n\nn = Total charge (Q) / Charge on 1 mole of electrons\nn = 4500 C / 96,487 C/mol = 0.0466 mol\n\nSince copper (II) sulfate is involved, the copper ion has a charge of +2 (Cu²⁺). Therefore, 1 mole of copper requires 2 moles of electrons for the reduction process:\n\nCu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu\n\nSo, the number of moles of copper deposited (n_Cu) is half the number of moles of electrons:\n\nn_Cu = 0.0466 mol / 2 = 0.0233 mol\n\nNow, we can find the mass of copper deposited (m_Cu) using the atomic mass of copper:\n\nm_Cu = n_Cu × atomic mass of copper\nm_Cu = 0.0233 mol × 63.55 g/mol = 1.48 g\n\nTherefore, the mass of copper deposited on the cathode is approximately 1.48 grams."
