    "message_2": "The student can use the capillary rise method to measure the surface tension of a liquid using simple materials found in a chemistry lab. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. Gather materials: The student will need a thin glass capillary tube (such as a Pasteur pipette), a ruler, a liquid sample, and a stand to hold the capillary tube vertically.\n\n2. Clean the capillary tube: Thoroughly clean the capillary tube with a suitable solvent to remove any contaminants that may affect the surface tension measurement.\n\n3. Fill the capillary tube: Dip the capillary tube into the liquid sample, allowing the liquid to rise inside the tube due to capillary action. Make sure the tube is held vertically.\n\n4. Measure the height of the liquid column: Once the liquid has stopped rising in the capillary tube, measure the height of the liquid column (h) from the surface of the liquid outside the tube to the top of the liquid column inside the tube using a ruler.\n\n5. Determine the radius of the capillary tube: Measure the inner diameter of the capillary tube (d) using a ruler or a micrometer, and then calculate the radius (r) by dividing the diameter by 2.\n\n6. Calculate the surface tension: Use the Jurin's Law formula to calculate the surface tension (γ) of the liquid:\n\nγ = (h * r * ρ * g) / 2\n\nwhere h is the height of the liquid column, r is the radius of the capillary tube, ρ is the density of the liquid, and g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s²).\n\nBy following these steps, the student can measure the surface tension of a liquid using simple materials found in a chemistry lab."
