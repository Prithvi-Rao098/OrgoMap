    "message_2": "Synthesizing pyridine from benzene and ammonia is not a direct process, as these two reactants do not readily combine to form pyridine. However, you can synthesize pyridine from benzene through a series of reactions. One of the most common methods is the Chichibabin pyridine synthesis, which involves the following steps:\n\n1. Nitration of benzene:\nFirst, you need to nitrate the benzene ring. This is done by treating benzene with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) at a low temperature. This reaction forms nitrobenzene.\n\nBenzene + HNO3 → Nitrobenzene + H2O\n\n2. Reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline:\nNext, you need to reduce the nitro group in nitrobenzene to an amino group. This can be done using various reducing agents, such as hydrogen gas (H2) in the presence of a catalyst like palladium on carbon (Pd/C) or iron (Fe) with hydrochloric acid (HCl). This reaction forms aniline.\n\nNitrobenzene + 3H2 → Aniline + 2H2O\n\n3. Formation of the Schiff base:\nAniline reacts with an aldehyde, such as formaldehyde (HCHO), to form a Schiff base (imine). This reaction is carried out in a basic medium, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n\nAniline + HCHO → Schiff base + H2O\n\n4. Chichibabin pyridine synthesis:\nThe Schiff base is then heated with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). This reaction leads to the formation of pyridine through a series of rearrangements and ring closures.\n\nSchiff base + 2NaNH2 → Pyridine + 2NH3 + Na2O\n\nThe mechanism of the Chichibabin pyridine synthesis involves the following steps:\n\n1. Deprotonation of the Schiff base by sodium amide to form an anionic intermediate.\n2. Intramolecular nucleophilic attack of the nitrogen anion on the imine carbon, leading to a ring closure and the formation of a six-membered ring.\n3. Rearrangement of the six-membered ring to form a dihydropyridine intermediate.\n4. A second deprotonation by sodium amide, followed by an intramolecular nucleophilic attack to form a fully aromatic pyridine ring.\n\nAfter synthesizing pyridine, it can be purified by distillation or other purification techniques. Keep in mind that these reactions involve hazardous chemicals and should be performed in a well-equipped laboratory with proper safety precautions."
