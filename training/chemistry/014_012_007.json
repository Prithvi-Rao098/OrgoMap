    "message_2": "Gadolinium-based metallofullerenes are a class of endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs) that consist of a gadolinium (Gd) atom or multiple Gd atoms encapsulated within a fullerene cage, typically made of carbon atoms. The structure and bonding of the metal complexes in these compounds play a crucial role in determining their magnetic properties.\n\nStructure and Bonding:\nThe structure of gadolinium-based metallofullerenes can be described as a gadolinium atom(s) encapsulated within a fullerene cage, such as C60, C70, or higher fullerenes. The fullerene cage is composed of carbon atoms arranged in a combination of pentagonal and hexagonal rings, forming a closed, hollow structure.\n\nThe bonding between the gadolinium atom(s) and the carbon cage is primarily through van der Waals forces and electrostatic interactions. The gadolinium atom(s) is not covalently bonded to the carbon atoms in the cage. Instead, the interaction between the metal and the cage is due to the electron transfer from the metal to the cage, resulting in a positively charged metal ion and a negatively charged cage. This charge transfer creates an attractive force between the metal ion and the cage, stabilizing the structure.\n\nMagnetic Properties:\nThe magnetic properties of gadolinium-based metallofullerenes are mainly determined by the gadolinium atom(s) encapsulated within the fullerene cage. Gadolinium is a rare-earth metal with a 4f electron configuration, which gives rise to its unique magnetic properties. The magnetic moment of a gadolinium atom arises from the unpaired electrons in its 4f orbitals.\n\nIn gadolinium-based metallofullerenes, the magnetic properties are influenced by the interaction between the gadolinium atom(s) and the carbon cage. The encapsulation of the gadolinium atom(s) within the cage can lead to a change in the electronic structure of the metal, which in turn affects its magnetic properties. For example, the magnetic moment of the gadolinium atom(s) can be reduced due to the electron transfer to the carbon cage.\n\nFurthermore, the magnetic properties of gadolinium-based metallofullerenes can be tuned by varying the size and shape of the fullerene cage, as well as the number of gadolinium atoms encapsulated within the cage. For instance, the encapsulation of multiple gadolinium atoms within a single fullerene cage can lead to the formation of gadolinium clusters, which can exhibit different magnetic properties compared to individual gadolinium atoms.\n\nOverall, the structure and bonding of the metal complexes in gadolinium-based metallofullerenes play a crucial role in determining their magnetic properties. The encapsulation of gadolinium atom(s) within a fullerene cage can lead to changes in the electronic structure of the metal, which in turn affects its magnetic properties. Additionally, the magnetic properties can be tuned by varying the size and shape of the fullerene cage and the number of gadolinium atoms encapsulated within the cage."
