    "message_2": "To determine the rate law expression for the reaction between hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and potassium iodide (KI), we need to analyze the experimental data provided and find the order of the reaction with respect to each reactant.\n\nLet's assume the rate law expression has the form: Rate = k[H2O2]^m[KI]^n\n\nWe can use the given data to find the values of m and n:\n\n1. Compare experiments 1 and 2 (keeping [KI] constant and doubling [H2O2]):\n(1.6 x 10^-5) / (8.0 x 10^-6) = (0.04^m / 0.02^m) * (0.01^n / 0.01^n)\n2 = 2^m\nm = 1\n\n2. Compare experiments 1 and 3 (keeping [H2O2] constant and doubling [KI]):\n(1.6 x 10^-5) / (8.0 x 10^-6) = (0.02^m / 0.02^m) * (0.02^n / 0.01^n)\n2 = 2^n\nn = 1\n\nSo, the rate law expression for the reaction between hydrogen peroxide and potassium iodide is:\n\nRate = k[H2O2]^1[KI]^1 or Rate = k[H2O2][KI]"
