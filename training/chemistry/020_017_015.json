    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kf) for the formation of the complex ion Cu(NH3)4 2+, we need to use the reaction and the given concentrations. The reaction is:\n\nCu2+ + 4NH3 ⇌ Cu(NH3)4 2+\n\nLet's assume that x moles of Cu2+ react with 4x moles of NH3 to form x moles of Cu(NH3)4 2+. At equilibrium, the concentrations will be:\n\n[Cu2+] = 0.005 - x\n[NH3] = 0.1 - 4x\n[Cu(NH3)4 2+] = x\n\nNow, we can write the expression for the equilibrium constant Kf:\n\nKf = [Cu(NH3)4 2+] / ([Cu2+] * [NH3]^4)\n\nSubstitute the equilibrium concentrations into the Kf expression:\n\nKf = (x) / ((0.005 - x) * (0.1 - 4x)^4)\n\nSince the complex ion formation is favored, we can assume that x is very small compared to 0.005 and 0.1. Therefore, we can approximate:\n\nKf ≈ (x) / (0.005 * 0.1^4)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of x. Since the reaction is favored, almost all of the Cu2+ ions will form the complex ion. Therefore, we can assume that x ≈ 0.005 M.\n\nKf ≈ (0.005) / (0.005 * 0.1^4)\nKf ≈ 1 / 0.1^4\nKf ≈ 1 / 0.0001\nKf ≈ 10,000\n\nThe equilibrium constant (Kf) for the formation of the complex ion Cu(NH3)4 2+ is approximately 10,000."
