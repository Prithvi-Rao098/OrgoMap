    "message_2": "To determine the percentage composition of isotopes in a sample of molecule X, we need to know the relative abundance of each isotope in the sample. This information is typically obtained from the mass spectrometry data. However, since you have not provided the mass spectrometry data, I will provide a general approach to solving this problem.\n\n1. Obtain the mass spectrometry data: This data will show the relative abundance of each isotope in the sample. The data is usually presented as a mass spectrum, with the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) on the x-axis and the relative abundance on the y-axis.\n\n2. Identify the peaks corresponding to each isotope: In the mass spectrum, there will be peaks corresponding to the isotopes of interest (Carbon-12, Carbon-13, and Nitrogen-15). The m/z values for these isotopes are 12, 13, and 15, respectively.\n\n3. Determine the relative abundance of each isotope: The relative abundance of each isotope can be determined by measuring the height or area of the peaks corresponding to each isotope in the mass spectrum. The relative abundance is proportional to the percentage composition of each isotope in the sample.\n\n4. Calculate the percentage composition of each isotope: To calculate the percentage composition of each isotope, divide the relative abundance of each isotope by the total abundance of all isotopes and multiply by 100.\n\nPercentage composition of Carbon-12 = (Relative abundance of Carbon-12 / Total abundance) × 100\nPercentage composition of Carbon-13 = (Relative abundance of Carbon-13 / Total abundance) × 100\nPercentage composition of Nitrogen-15 = (Relative abundance of Nitrogen-15 / Total abundance) × 100\n\nBy following these steps and using the mass spectrometry data, you can determine the percentage composition of Carbon-12, Carbon-13, and Nitrogen-15 isotopes in the sample of molecule X."
