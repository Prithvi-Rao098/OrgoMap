    "message_2": "To calculate the change in enthalpy (ΔH) for the given reaction, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nCH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(g)\n\nNext, we need to find the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) for each substance involved in the reaction. The standard enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a substance is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states at 298 K and 1 atm pressure. The values can be found in a standard thermodynamic table. The values are:\n\nΔHf°(CH4) = -74.8 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(O2) = 0 kJ/mol (since O2 is in its standard state)\nΔHf°(CO2) = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(H2O) = -241.8 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the change in enthalpy (ΔH) for the reaction using the following equation:\n\nΔH = [Σ (moles of products × ΔHf° of products)] - [Σ (moles of reactants × ΔHf° of reactants)]\n\nΔH = [(1 mol CO2 × -393.5 kJ/mol) + (2 mol H2O × -241.8 kJ/mol)] - [(1 mol CH4 × -74.8 kJ/mol) + (2 mol O2 × 0 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH = (-393.5 - 2 × 241.8 + 74.8) kJ/mol\nΔH = (-393.5 - 483.6 + 74.8) kJ/mol\nΔH = -802.3 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we need to find the moles of CH4 in 25 grams:\n\nmoles of CH4 = mass / molar mass\nmoles of CH4 = 25 g / (12.01 g/mol C + 4 × 1.01 g/mol H)\nmoles of CH4 = 25 g / 16.05 g/mol\nmoles of CH4 = 1.556 mol\n\nFinally, we can calculate the change in enthalpy for 25 grams of CH4:\n\nΔH = -802.3 kJ/mol × 1.556 mol\nΔH = -1248.3 kJ\n\nThe change in enthalpy for the reaction of 25 grams of methane with excess oxygen is -1248.3 kJ."
