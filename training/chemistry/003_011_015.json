    "message_2": "Sodium chloride (NaCl) has a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure, also known as the rock salt structure. In this structure, each sodium ion (Na+) is surrounded by six chloride ions (Cl-) and vice versa, forming a three-dimensional lattice. The ions are arranged in such a way that they form alternating layers of Na+ and Cl- ions, with each ion being surrounded by ions of the opposite charge.\n\nThis crystal structure contributes to the physical properties of NaCl in the following ways:\n\n1. Melting point: The strong electrostatic attraction between the positively charged Na+ ions and the negatively charged Cl- ions in the crystal lattice requires a significant amount of energy to overcome. This results in a relatively high melting point for NaCl, which is around 801째C (1,474째F).\n\n2. Boiling point: Similarly, the strong ionic bonds in the NaCl crystal lattice require a large amount of energy to break, leading to a high boiling point of about 1,413째C (2,575째F).\n\n3. Solubility: NaCl is highly soluble in polar solvents like water. This is because the polar water molecules are able to interact with the charged Na+ and Cl- ions, effectively breaking the ionic bonds in the crystal lattice and dissolving the NaCl. The oxygen atom in the water molecule, which carries a partial negative charge, is attracted to the Na+ ions, while the hydrogen atoms, which carry partial positive charges, are attracted to the Cl- ions. These interactions, known as ion-dipole interactions, allow the NaCl to dissolve in water.\n\nIn summary, the face-centered cubic crystal structure of sodium chloride, with its strong ionic bonds, is responsible for its high melting and boiling points, as well as its high solubility in polar solvents like water."
