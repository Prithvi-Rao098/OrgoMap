    "message_2": "The reaction between an aldehyde and a primary amine to form an imine product is called imine formation. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nRCHO + HNR'2 â†’ RCH=NR' + H2O\n\nWhere R and R' are alkyl or aryl groups.\n\nThe mechanism for this reaction involves the following steps:\n\n1. Nucleophilic attack: The nitrogen atom of the primary amine (HNR'2) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde (RCHO). This results in the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate and the breaking of the carbonyl double bond (C=O).\n\n2. Proton transfer: A proton (H+) is transferred from the nitrogen atom of the tetrahedral intermediate to one of the oxygen atoms, forming an alcohol group (-OH) and a positively charged nitrogen atom (NR'2H+).\n\n3. Elimination of water: The alcohol group (-OH) acts as a leaving group and is eliminated as a water molecule (H2O). This results in the formation of a double bond between the carbon and nitrogen atoms (C=N), creating the imine product (RCH=NR').\n\nIn summary, the mechanism for the reaction between an aldehyde and a primary amine to form an imine product involves nucleophilic attack, proton transfer, and elimination of water."
