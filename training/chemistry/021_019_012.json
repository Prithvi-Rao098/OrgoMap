    "message_1": "What is the solubility of table salt (NaCl) in water, and what factors affect its solubility in the solvent?",
    "message_2": "The solubility of table salt (sodium chloride, NaCl) in water at room temperature (25째C) is approximately 357 grams per liter (g/L). This means that 357 grams of NaCl can dissolve in 1 liter of water at 25째C.\n\nSeveral factors can affect the solubility of NaCl in water:\n\n1. Temperature: As the temperature of the water increases, the solubility of NaCl also increases. For example, at 0째C, the solubility is about 357 g/L, while at 100째C, it increases to around 391 g/L.\n\n2. Presence of other ions: The presence of other ions in the water can affect the solubility of NaCl. For example, the presence of other salts or dissolved substances can reduce the solubility of NaCl due to a phenomenon called the \"common ion effect.\"\n\n3. Pressure: The solubility of NaCl in water is not significantly affected by pressure changes. This is because NaCl is a solid, and the solubility of solids in liquids is generally not affected by pressure.\n\n4. pH: The solubility of NaCl is not affected by the pH of the water, as it is a neutral salt and does not react with water to form acidic or basic solutions."
