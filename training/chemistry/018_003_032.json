    "message_2": "Increasing the temperature of a chemical reaction typically increases the reaction rate, and this is also true for the reaction between magnesium ribbon and hydrochloric acid. The reaction between magnesium (Mg) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) can be represented by the following balanced equation:\n\nMg (s) + 2HCl (aq) â†’ MgCl2 (aq) + H2 (g)\n\nWhen the temperature is increased, the kinetic energy of the particles involved in the reaction also increases. This leads to more frequent collisions between the magnesium and hydrochloric acid particles, as well as more energetic collisions. As a result, a greater proportion of these collisions will have enough energy to overcome the activation energy barrier, allowing the reaction to proceed.\n\nIn summary, increasing the temperature will increase the reaction rate of the chemical reaction between magnesium ribbon and hydrochloric acid due to more frequent and energetic collisions between the reacting particles."
