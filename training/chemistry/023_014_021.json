    "message_2": "To determine the minimum amount of bromine required to prepare 10 grams of 4-bromoacetanilide from acetanilide, we first need to write the balanced equation for the reaction:\n\nAcetanilide + Br2 → 4-bromoacetanilide + HBr\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of moles of 4-bromoacetanilide required. To do this, we will use the formula:\n\nmoles = mass (g) / molar mass (g/mol)\n\nThe molar mass of 4-bromoacetanilide is 214.06 g/mol (C8H8BrNO). So, for 10 grams of 4-bromoacetanilide:\n\nmoles of 4-bromoacetanilide = 10 g / 214.06 g/mol = 0.0467 mol\n\nAccording to the balanced equation, 1 mole of acetanilide reacts with 1 mole of Br2 to produce 1 mole of 4-bromoacetanilide. Therefore, the number of moles of bromine required is the same as the number of moles of 4-bromoacetanilide:\n\nmoles of Br2 = 0.0467 mol\n\nNow, we need to convert the moles of Br2 to grams. The molar mass of Br2 is 159.81 g/mol:\n\nmass of Br2 (g) = moles of Br2 × molar mass of Br2\nmass of Br2 (g) = 0.0467 mol × 159.81 g/mol = 7.47 g\n\nSo, the minimum amount of bromine required to prepare 10 grams of 4-bromoacetanilide from acetanilide is 7.47 grams."
