    "message_1": "A chemistry student is provided with a mixture of two chemicals, A and B, but the quantity of each chemical is unknown. The student uses mass balance calculations to determine the mass of each component in the mixture. Chemical A has a molecular weight of 100 g/mol, while chemical B has a molecular weight of 120 g/mol. \nIf the mixture contains 10% more of chemical A by mass than chemical B, what is the mass of each component in the mixture?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the mass of chemical A as mA and the mass of chemical B as mB. According to the problem, the mass of chemical A is 10% more than the mass of chemical B. We can write this as:\n\nmA = 1.10 * mB\n\nNow, we need more information to solve this problem, such as the total mass of the mixture. Let's assume the total mass of the mixture is mT. Then we can write:\n\nmT = mA + mB\n\nWe can substitute the expression for mA from the first equation into the second equation:\n\nmT = 1.10 * mB + mB\n\nNow, we need the value of mT to solve for mB and subsequently mA."
