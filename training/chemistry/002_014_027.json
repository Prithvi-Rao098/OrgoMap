    "message_2": "To determine the formal charge of the central atom (Sulfur) in SF6, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the number of valence electrons for the central atom (Sulfur).\n2. Calculate the number of electrons assigned to the central atom in the Lewis structure.\n3. Subtract the number of assigned electrons from the number of valence electrons to find the formal charge.\n\nStep 1: Determine the number of valence electrons for Sulfur (S).\nSulfur is in Group 16 (also known as Group 6A) of the periodic table, so it has 6 valence electrons.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of electrons assigned to the central atom in the Lewis structure.\nIn SF6, Sulfur is bonded to six Fluorine atoms. Each bond consists of 2 electrons, but since Sulfur is only contributing one electron to each bond, we will count only one electron per bond for Sulfur. So, there are 6 electrons assigned to Sulfur in the Lewis structure.\n\nStep 3: Subtract the number of assigned electrons from the number of valence electrons to find the formal charge.\nFormal charge = (Valence electrons) - (Assigned electrons)\nFormal charge = 6 - 6\nFormal charge = 0\n\nTherefore, the formal charge of the central atom (Sulfur) in SF6 is 0."
