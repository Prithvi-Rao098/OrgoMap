    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the dissolution of 5.00 grams of solid magnesium chloride (MgCl2) in 250.0 mL of water at 25 ℃, we need to first determine the number of moles of MgCl2 and then use the molar enthalpy of hydration.\n\n1. Calculate the number of moles of MgCl2:\nMgCl2 has a molar mass of 24.31 g/mol (Mg) + 2 * 35.45 g/mol (Cl) = 95.21 g/mol.\n\nmoles of MgCl2 = mass / molar mass\nmoles of MgCl2 = 5.00 g / 95.21 g/mol = 0.0525 mol\n\n2. Use the molar enthalpy of hydration to calculate the standard enthalpy change:\nThe molar enthalpy of hydration of MgCl2 is given as -641 kJ/mol. This means that when 1 mole of MgCl2 dissolves in water, the enthalpy change is -641 kJ.\n\nenthalpy change = moles * molar enthalpy of hydration\nenthalpy change = 0.0525 mol * (-641 kJ/mol) = -33.65 kJ\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the dissolution of 5.00 grams of solid magnesium chloride (MgCl2) in 250.0 mL of water at 25 ℃ is -33.65 kJ."
