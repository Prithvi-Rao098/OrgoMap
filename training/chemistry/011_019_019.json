    "message_2": "The pore geometry of zeolite structures plays a crucial role in determining the diffusion rates of different molecules like water, methane, and oxygen through the material. Computational modeling can help predict these diffusion rates by considering various factors related to the zeolite's structure and the properties of the diffusing molecules. Some of the key factors that influence the diffusion rates are:\n\n1. Pore size: The size of the pores in the zeolite structure directly affects the diffusion rates of molecules. Smaller pores can hinder the passage of larger molecules, while allowing smaller molecules to pass through more easily. In contrast, larger pores can accommodate a wider range of molecular sizes, leading to different diffusion rates for various molecules.\n\n2. Pore shape: The shape of the pores in the zeolite structure can also impact the diffusion rates. For example, pores with a more tortuous or winding path can slow down the diffusion of molecules, as they need to navigate through the complex pore network. On the other hand, straight and uniform pores can facilitate faster diffusion.\n\n3. Pore connectivity: The connectivity of the pores in the zeolite structure can influence the diffusion rates as well. A highly interconnected pore network can provide multiple pathways for molecules to diffuse through the material, leading to higher diffusion rates. In contrast, a poorly connected pore network can limit the available pathways, resulting in slower diffusion.\n\n4. Molecular size and shape: The size and shape of the diffusing molecules can also affect their diffusion rates through the zeolite structure. Larger or more complex molecules may have a harder time navigating through the pores, leading to slower diffusion rates compared to smaller or simpler molecules.\n\n5. Molecular interactions: The interactions between the diffusing molecules and the zeolite framework can impact the diffusion rates. Stronger interactions, such as hydrogen bonding or van der Waals forces, can slow down the diffusion process, while weaker interactions can facilitate faster diffusion.\n\nComputational modeling can help predict the diffusion rates of different molecules through zeolite structures by taking these factors into account. By simulating the behavior of molecules within the zeolite pores and analyzing their interactions with the framework, researchers can gain insights into how the pore geometry affects the diffusion rates and ultimately design zeolites with tailored properties for specific applications, such as gas separation, catalysis, or adsorption."
