    "message_2": "The major product formed when propanal is treated with a catalytic amount of NaOH and CH3CH2I is 2-ethoxypropanal. The reaction proceeds through a nucleophilic addition mechanism. Here is the stepwise mechanism:\n\n1. Deprotonation: The hydroxide ion (OH-) from NaOH acts as a base and abstracts a proton from the α-carbon of propanal, forming an enolate ion and water.\n\n   Propanal + OH- → Enolate ion + H2O\n\n2. Nucleophilic attack: The enolate ion, being a strong nucleophile, attacks the electrophilic carbon of the CH3CH2I molecule, displacing the iodide ion (I-) and forming a new C-O bond.\n\n   Enolate ion + CH3CH2I → 2-Ethoxypropanal + I-\n\nOverall, the reaction can be summarized as:\n\n   Propanal + NaOH + CH3CH2I → 2-Ethoxypropanal + NaI + H2O"
