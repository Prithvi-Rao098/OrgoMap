    "message_2": "The conductivity of an aqueous solution of sodium chloride (NaCl) is affected by its concentration. As the concentration of NaCl in the solution increases, the conductivity of the solution also increases. This is because the number of ions (Na+ and Cl-) available to carry the electrical charge increases with the increase in concentration.\n\nHowever, the relationship between concentration and conductivity is not linear. At lower concentrations, the increase in conductivity is more significant, while at higher concentrations, the increase in conductivity becomes less pronounced. This is due to the fact that at higher concentrations, the ions are more likely to interact with each other, which can reduce their mobility and thus decrease the overall conductivity of the solution.\n\nIn summary, the conductivity of a sodium chloride aqueous solution increases with increasing concentration, but the relationship is not linear, and the rate of increase in conductivity decreases at higher concentrations."
