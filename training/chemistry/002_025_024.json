The metal complex has a central metal ion of cobalt surrounded by six cyanide ions. Calculate the magnetic moment and write the electronic configuration of the complex.",
    "message_2": "The magnetic moment of a metal complex can be calculated using the formula:\n\nμ = √(n(n+2)) BM\n\nwhere μ is the magnetic moment, n is the number of unpaired electrons, and BM stands for Bohr Magneton.\n\nIn this case, the metal complex has three unpaired electrons (n = 3). Plugging this value into the formula, we get:\n\nμ = √(3(3+2)) BM\nμ = √(3(5)) BM\nμ = √15 BM\n\nThe calculated magnetic moment is √15 BM, which is approximately 3.87 BM. This value is higher than the given spin magnetic moment of 2.82 BM, which suggests that there might be some orbital contribution to the magnetic moment as well.\n\nNow let's determine the electronic configuration of the complex. The central metal ion is cobalt (Co), which has an atomic number of 27. The electronic configuration of Co is [Ar] 3d^7 4s^2. In the presence of six cyanide ions (CN^-), cobalt forms a complex with a -3 oxidation state (Co^3+). The electronic configuration of Co^3+ is [Ar] 3d^6.\n\nSince the complex has a low-spin magnetic moment of 2.82 BM, it is likely a low-spin complex. In a low-spin octahedral complex, the electrons fill the lower energy d orbitals (t2g) first. Therefore, the electronic configuration of the Co^3+ ion in the complex is:\n\nt2g^6 eg^0\n\nIn summary, the calculated magnetic moment of the metal complex is approximately 3.87 BM, and the electronic configuration of the Co^3+ ion in the complex is t2g^6 eg^0."
