    "message_2": "To prepare phenylalanine from benzyl chloride and ammonia, you can follow the Strecker amino acid synthesis. The Strecker synthesis is a well-established method for preparing α-amino acids from aldehydes or ketones, ammonia, and hydrogen cyanide (HCN). Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Preparation of benzaldehyde from benzyl chloride:\nFirst, you need to convert benzyl chloride to benzaldehyde. This can be achieved through the hydrolysis of benzyl chloride followed by oxidation.\n\na) Hydrolysis of benzyl chloride:\nReagents: Aqueous NaOH (sodium hydroxide) solution\nConditions: Heat the mixture under reflux for several hours\nReaction: Benzyl chloride reacts with NaOH to form benzyl alcohol and NaCl\n\nC6H5CH2Cl + NaOH → C6H5CH2OH + NaCl\n\nb) Oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde:\nReagents: PCC (pyridinium chlorochromate) or DMP (Dess-Martin periodinane) as the oxidizing agent\nConditions: Room temperature, stir the mixture for several hours\nReaction: Benzyl alcohol is oxidized to benzaldehyde\n\nC6H5CH2OH + PCC → C6H5CHO + HCl + Cr(OH)3\n\n2. Strecker synthesis of phenylalanine:\n\na) Formation of imine:\nReagents: Ammonia (NH3)\nConditions: Room temperature, stir the mixture for several hours\nReaction: Benzaldehyde reacts with ammonia to form an imine intermediate\n\nC6H5CHO + NH3 → C6H5CH=NH + H2O\n\nb) Nucleophilic addition of HCN:\nReagents: HCN (hydrogen cyanide) or a cyanide source like NaCN or KCN\nConditions: Room temperature, stir the mixture for several hours\nReaction: The imine reacts with HCN to form an α-aminonitrile\n\nC6H5CH=NH + HCN → C6H5CH(NH2)CN\n\nc) Hydrolysis of α-aminonitrile:\nReagents: Aqueous HCl (hydrochloric acid) or H2SO4 (sulfuric acid)\nConditions: Heat the mixture under reflux for several hours\nReaction: The α-aminonitrile is hydrolyzed to form phenylalanine\n\nC6H5CH(NH2)CN + 2H2O + HCl → C6H5CH(NH2)COOH + NH4Cl\n\nAfter the reaction is complete, you can isolate the phenylalanine by filtration, followed by purification through recrystallization or chromatography.\n\nPlease note that working with hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is extremely dangerous, as it is a highly toxic and volatile compound. This synthesis should only be performed by experienced chemists in a well-equipped laboratory with proper safety precautions in place."
