Assume that the Faraday constant is 96,485 Coulombs per mole of electrons and the gas constant is 8.314 J/mole.K.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the maximum electrical work that can be obtained from an electrochemical cell, we first need to determine the cell potential (E_cell). The cell potential can be calculated using the standard reduction potentials of the two half-reactions involved. In this case, we have a standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) and a zinc electrode.\n\nThe standard reduction potential for the SHE is given as -0.76 V, and for the zinc electrode, it is given as -0.46 V. Since zinc is being oxidized, we need to reverse the sign of its reduction potential to obtain its oxidation potential.\n\nOxidation potential of zinc = +0.46 V\n\nNow, we can calculate the cell potential (E_cell) using the following formula:\n\nE_cell = Reduction potential of cathode - Oxidation potential of anode\n\nSince the SHE has a more negative reduction potential, it will act as the anode (oxidation half-cell), and the zinc electrode will act as the cathode (reduction half-cell).\n\nE_cell = (-0.46 V) - (-0.76 V) = 0.30 V\n\nNow that we have the cell potential, we can calculate the maximum electrical work (W_max) using the following formula:\n\nW_max = -n * F * E_cell\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of electrons transferred, F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol), and E_cell is the cell potential.\n\nSince 0.5 moles of zinc metal is oxidized, and the oxidation of one mole of zinc releases two moles of electrons (Zn -> Zn²⁺ + 2e⁻), the number of moles of electrons transferred (n) is:\n\nn = 0.5 moles of Zn * 2 moles of e⁻/mole of Zn = 1 mole of e⁻\n\nNow we can calculate the maximum electrical work:\n\nW_max = -1 mol * 96,485 C/mol * 0.30 V = -28,945.5 J\n\nThe maximum electrical work that can be obtained from this electrochemical cell is -28,945.5 Joules. The negative sign indicates that the work is done by the system (the electrochemical cell) on the surroundings."
