    "message_2": "To calculate the pH of a 0.2 M solution of acetic acid, we can use the Ka expression and the formula for pH. \n\nKa = [H+][A-]/[HA]\n\nWhere Ka is the acid dissociation constant, [H+] is the concentration of hydrogen ions, [A-] is the concentration of acetate ions, and [HA] is the concentration of acetic acid.\n\nLet x be the concentration of H+ ions and A- ions that dissociate from the acetic acid. Then, the concentration of acetic acid remaining is (0.2 - x).\n\nNow, we can set up the Ka expression:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 = (x)(x)/(0.2 - x)\n\nSince Ka is very small, we can assume that x is much smaller than 0.2, so we can simplify the equation to:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 = x^2/0.2\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nx^2 = 1.8 x 10^-5 * 0.2\nx^2 = 3.6 x 10^-6\nx = √(3.6 x 10^-6)\nx ≈ 1.9 x 10^-3\n\nNow that we have the concentration of H+ ions (x), we can calculate the pH using the formula:\n\npH = -log[H+]\n\npH = -log(1.9 x 10^-3)\npH ≈ 2.72\n\nSo, the pH of the 0.2 M solution of acetic acid at 25°C is approximately 2.72."
