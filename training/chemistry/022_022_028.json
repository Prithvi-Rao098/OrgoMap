    "message_2": "To predict the direction in which the equilibrium will shift, we need to consider the reaction between nitrogen and oxygen gases. The reaction is as follows:\n\nN2(g) + O2(g) â‡Œ 2NO(g)\n\nThis reaction is endothermic, meaning it absorbs heat. According to Le Chatelier's principle, when a change is applied to a system at equilibrium, the system will adjust itself to counteract the change and restore equilibrium.\n\nWhen the temperature of the container is increased, the system will try to counteract this change by shifting the equilibrium in the direction that absorbs the heat. In this case, since the reaction is endothermic, the equilibrium will shift to the right, towards the formation of more NO gas.\n\nThis shift occurs because the increased temperature provides more energy for the reaction to proceed in the endothermic direction, consuming more N2 and O2 gases and producing more NO gas. As a result, the equilibrium shifts to the right to restore balance and maintain equilibrium in the system."
