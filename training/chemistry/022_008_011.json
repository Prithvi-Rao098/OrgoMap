    "message_2": "When a piece of copper metal is placed in a solution of silver nitrate, a single displacement reaction occurs. Copper displaces silver in the silver nitrate solution, forming copper(II) nitrate and silver metal. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nCu(s) + 2AgNO3(aq) â†’ Cu(NO3)2(aq) + 2Ag(s)\n\nThe products of this reaction are copper(II) nitrate (Cu(NO3)2) in aqueous solution and solid silver (Ag) metal."
