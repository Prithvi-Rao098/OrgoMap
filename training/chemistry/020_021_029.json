    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (K) for the given redox reaction, we first need to determine the standard cell potential (E°cell) for the reaction. We can do this by combining the half-reactions and their respective standard reduction potentials (E°).\n\nThe half-reactions are:\n\n1. Fe3+(aq) + e- → Fe2+(aq)  E° = 0.771 V\n2. H2O2(aq) + 2H+(aq) + 2e- → 2H2O(l)  E° = 1.776 V\n\nThe overall redox reaction is:\n\nFe2+(aq) + H2O2(aq) + 2H+(aq) ⇌ Fe3+(aq) + 2H2O(l)\n\nTo find E°cell, we subtract the standard reduction potential of the first half-reaction from the second half-reaction:\n\nE°cell = E°(H2O2/H2O) - E°(Fe3+/Fe2+)\nE°cell = 1.776 V - 0.771 V\nE°cell = 1.005 V\n\nNow that we have the standard cell potential, we can use the Nernst equation to find the equilibrium constant (K). The Nernst equation is:\n\nE°cell = (RT/nF) * ln(K)\n\nWhere:\nR = 8.314 J/(mol*K) (gas constant)\nT = 298 K (temperature in Kelvin, 25°C + 273)\nn = 2 (number of electrons transferred in the reaction)\nF = 96485 C/mol (Faraday's constant)\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for K:\n\nK = exp(nFE°cell/RT)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nK = exp(2 * 96485 C/mol * 1.005 V / (8.314 J/(mol*K) * 298 K))\nK = exp(40.56)\n\nK ≈ 3.3 × 10^17\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant for the given redox reaction at 25°C is approximately 3.3 × 10^17."
