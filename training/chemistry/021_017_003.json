    "message_2": "In a sample of methane gas (CH4) at room temperature and pressure, the primary type of intermolecular forces present are London dispersion forces (also known as van der Waals forces or induced-dipole induced-dipole interactions). These forces arise due to the temporary fluctuations in electron distribution around the molecules, which create temporary dipoles that attract other nearby molecules. Methane is a nonpolar molecule, so it does not exhibit hydrogen bonding or dipole-dipole interactions."
