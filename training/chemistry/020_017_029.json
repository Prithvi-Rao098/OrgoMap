    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (K) for the formation of the complex ion Cu(NH3)4²⁺, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nCu²⁺(aq) + 4NH₃(aq) ⇌ Cu(NH₃)₄²⁺(aq)\n\nNext, we need to determine the initial and equilibrium concentrations of the species involved in the reaction. Since we have 1.0 mol of Cu²⁺ in a 1.0 L flask, the initial concentration of Cu²⁺ is 1.0 M. At equilibrium, 0.8 mol of Cu(NH₃)₄²⁺ is formed, so the equilibrium concentration of Cu(NH₃)₄²⁺ is 0.8 M. Since 0.8 mol of Cu(NH₃)₄²⁺ is formed from 0.8 mol of Cu²⁺, the equilibrium concentration of Cu²⁺ is 1.0 - 0.8 = 0.2 M.\n\nSince we have excess NH₃, we can assume that its concentration does not change significantly during the reaction. Therefore, we can use the equilibrium expression for the reaction to find the equilibrium constant K:\n\nK = [Cu(NH₃)₄²⁺] / ([Cu²⁺] * [NH₃]^4)\n\nWe know the equilibrium concentrations of Cu(NH₃)₄²⁺ and Cu²⁺, but we don't know the concentration of NH₃. However, since NH₃ is in excess, we can assume that its concentration is much larger than the concentrations of the other species, and therefore its concentration to the power of 4 will not change significantly during the reaction. This means that the ratio [NH₃]^4 / K will remain constant.\n\nNow we can plug in the equilibrium concentrations to find K:\n\nK = [0.8] / ([0.2] * [NH₃]^4)\n\nK * [0.2] * [NH₃]^4 = 0.8\n\nK = 0.8 / ([0.2] * [NH₃]^4)\n\nSince we don't know the concentration of NH₃, we cannot find the exact value of K. However, we can express K in terms of the concentration of NH₃:\n\nK = 4 / [NH₃]^4"
