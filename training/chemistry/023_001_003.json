    "message_2": "To determine the maximum yield of aspirin, we first need to find the limiting reactant in the reaction between salicylic acid and acetic anhydride. The balanced chemical equation for the synthesis of aspirin is:\n\nC7H6O3 (salicylic acid) + C4H6O3 (acetic anhydride) â†’ C9H8O4 (aspirin) + C2H4O2 (acetic acid)\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of each reactant:\nMoles of salicylic acid = mass / molar mass = 2 g / 138.12 g/mol = 0.0145 mol\nThe density of acetic anhydride is 1.08 g/mL, so the mass of acetic anhydride is 2.5 mL * 1.08 g/mL = 2.7 g.\nMoles of acetic anhydride = mass / molar mass = 2.7 g / 102.09 g/mol = 0.0264 mol\n\nNow, we need to find the mole ratio of the reactants:\nMole ratio = moles of salicylic acid / moles of acetic anhydride = 0.0145 mol / 0.0264 mol = 0.549\n\nSince the mole ratio is less than 1, salicylic acid is the limiting reactant. The reaction will proceed to completion based on the moles of salicylic acid.\n\nNow, we can find the theoretical yield of aspirin:\nMoles of aspirin = moles of salicylic acid = 0.0145 mol\nMass of aspirin = moles * molar mass = 0.0145 mol * 180.16 g/mol = 2.612 g\n\nSince the purity of the aspirin produced is 95%, the maximum yield of aspirin is:\nMaximum yield = theoretical yield * purity = 2.612 g * 0.95 = 2.481 g\n\nTherefore, the maximum yield of aspirin that can be obtained from 2 grams of salicylic acid and 2.5 ml of acetic anhydride, if the reaction proceeds to completion and the purity of the aspirin produced is 95%, is 2.481 grams."
