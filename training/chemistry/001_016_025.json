    "message_2": "The nucleophilic substitution reaction between 2-bromopropane and potassium hydroxide in ethanol as the solvent follows an SN2 (Substitution Nucleophilic Bimolecular) mechanism. Here's a step-by-step description of the reaction mechanism:\n\n1. Formation of nucleophile: Potassium hydroxide (KOH) dissociates into potassium (K+) and hydroxide (OH-) ions in the ethanol solvent. The hydroxide ion acts as a nucleophile due to its negative charge and high reactivity.\n\n2. Approach of the nucleophile: The hydroxide ion (OH-) approaches the 2-bromopropane molecule from the side opposite to the bromine atom. This is because the bromine atom is a good leaving group and has a partial negative charge, which repels the nucleophile.\n\n3. Nucleophilic attack: The hydroxide ion (OH-) attacks the electrophilic carbon atom (the one bonded to the bromine atom) in 2-bromopropane. This results in the formation of a transition state in which the carbon atom is partially bonded to both the hydroxide ion and the bromine atom.\n\n4. Departure of the leaving group: As the bond between the carbon atom and the hydroxide ion strengthens, the bond between the carbon atom and the bromine atom weakens. Finally, the bromine atom leaves as a bromide ion (Br-), and the carbon atom forms a new bond with the hydroxide ion.\n\n5. Formation of the product: The reaction results in the formation of propan-2-ol, with the hydroxide ion now bonded to the carbon atom where the bromine atom was previously attached. Potassium bromide (KBr) is also formed as a side product.\n\nOverall, the SN2 mechanism for this reaction can be summarized as:\n\n2-bromopropane + OH- â†’ propan-2-ol + Br-"
