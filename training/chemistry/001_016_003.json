    "message_2": "The reaction between benzene and bromine to form bromobenzene is an example of electrophilic aromatic substitution. The mechanism involves the following steps:\n\n1. Formation of the electrophile: Bromine (Br2) reacts with a Lewis acid catalyst, such as iron(III) bromide (FeBr3) or aluminum bromide (AlBr3), to form a highly electrophilic bromine ion (Br+). The catalyst polarizes the bromine molecule, making one of the bromine atoms electron-deficient.\n\n   Br2 + FeBr3 → Br+ + FeBr4-\n\n2. Attack of the electrophile: The electron-rich benzene ring donates a pair of electrons from one of its pi bonds to the electrophilic bromine ion (Br+), forming a sigma bond between the bromine and the carbon atom in the ring. This results in the formation of a positively charged cyclohexadienyl cation (also known as an arenium ion or Wheland intermediate) and disrupts the aromaticity of the benzene ring.\n\n3. Deprotonation: A base, usually the halogen anion generated in the first step (Br-), abstracts a proton from the cyclohexadienyl cation, regenerating the aromaticity of the benzene ring and forming bromobenzene as the final product.\n\n   C6H5Br+HBr- → C6H5Br + HBr\n\n4. Regeneration of the catalyst: The hydrogen bromide (HBr) formed in the previous step reacts with the iron(III) bromide (FeBr4-) to regenerate the catalyst (FeBr3) and release a bromide ion (Br-).\n\n   HBr + FeBr4- → FeBr3 + Br-\n\nOverall, the reaction can be summarized as:\n\n   C6H6 + Br2 → C6H5Br + HBr\n\nThe reaction mechanism involves the formation of an electrophile, attack of the electrophile on the benzene ring, deprotonation to restore aromaticity, and regeneration of the catalyst."
