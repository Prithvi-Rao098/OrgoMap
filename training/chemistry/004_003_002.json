    "message_2": "To identify the unknown compound X using the mass spectrometry data provided, we will analyze the molecular ion peak and the fragment ions.\n\n1. Molecular ion peak at m/z 172: This indicates that the molecular weight of the compound is 172 g/mol.\n\n2. Fragment ions at m/z 145 and 127: These peaks suggest that the compound has lost 27 and 45 mass units, respectively, during fragmentation.\n\nNow, let's analyze the mass differences between the molecular ion peak and the fragment ions:\n\n- Loss of 27 mass units (172 - 145): This could be due to the loss of a CH3CO group (15 + 12 = 27), which is a common fragmentation pattern for esters.\n\n- Loss of 45 mass units (172 - 127): This could be due to the loss of a COOH group (12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45), which is a common fragmentation pattern for carboxylic acids.\n\nConsidering these fragmentation patterns, the unknown compound X could be an ester with a carboxylic acid group. One possible structure that fits the molecular weight and fragmentation pattern is ethyl benzoate (C9H10O2), which has a molecular weight of 166 + 6 = 172 g/mol.\n\nEthyl benzoate (C9H10O2) structure:\n- A benzene ring (C6H5) with a molecular weight of 12*6 + 1*5 = 77 g/mol\n- An ester group (COOCH2CH3) with a molecular weight of 12 + 16 + 16 + 12 + 1*3 = 95 g/mol\n\nIn conclusion, based on the mass spectrometry data provided, the unknown compound X is likely to be ethyl benzoate (C9H10O2) with a molecular weight of 172 g/mol."
