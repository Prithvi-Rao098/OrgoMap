Provide examples of each and discuss the potential applications of this knowledge in areas such as materials science and drug design.",
    "message_2": "The calculation of electronic excited states and optical properties in molecules depends on their electronic structure, which is influenced by the presence or absence of conjugation. Conjugated systems are characterized by alternating single and double bonds, where the electrons in the double bonds are delocalized across the entire system. In contrast, non-conjugated systems have localized electrons in their single and double bonds.\n\nIn conjugated systems, the delocalization of electrons leads to a lower energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). This smaller energy gap results in lower excitation energies and longer absorption wavelengths, which can be calculated using quantum chemistry methods such as time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) or configuration interaction singles (CIS). Examples of conjugated molecules include polyenes, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and conjugated polymers like polyacetylene.\n\nOn the other hand, non-conjugated systems have a larger energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO due to the localized nature of their electrons. This leads to higher excitation energies and shorter absorption wavelengths. Examples of non-conjugated molecules include alkanes, simple alcohols, and non-conjugated polymers like polyethylene.\n\nThe knowledge of electronic excited states and optical properties in conjugated and non-conjugated systems has several applications in materials science and drug design:\n\n1. Materials Science: Understanding the electronic and optical properties of conjugated systems has led to the development of organic semiconductors, which are used in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic photovoltaics (OPVs), and organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). These materials offer advantages such as flexibility, low cost, and ease of processing compared to traditional inorganic semiconductors.\n\n2. Drug Design: The optical properties of conjugated systems can be exploited in the design of fluorescent probes and sensors for biological applications. For example, conjugated molecules can be used as fluorophores in fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays to study protein-protein interactions or as imaging agents in fluorescence microscopy.\n\n3. Photodynamic Therapy: Conjugated molecules can be used as photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy (PDT) for cancer treatment. These molecules absorb light and generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can selectively kill cancer cells.\n\n4. Nonlinear Optics: Conjugated systems with large nonlinear optical properties can be used in applications such as optical switching, frequency conversion, and optical data storage.\n\nIn conclusion, the calculation of electronic excited states and optical properties in conjugated and non-conjugated systems is crucial for understanding their behavior and potential applications in various fields such as materials science and drug design. The delocalization of electrons in conjugated systems leads to unique properties that can be exploited for the development of novel materials and therapeutics."
