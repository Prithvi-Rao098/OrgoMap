    "message_2": "In a nuclear fusion reaction, two deuterium nuclei (each with one proton and one neutron) combine to form helium-3 (with two protons and one neutron) and a neutron. The energy released in this reaction can be calculated using the mass defect and Einstein's famous equation, E=mc².\n\nFirst, we need to find the mass defect (Δm) of the reaction. The mass defect is the difference between the total mass of the reactants and the total mass of the products.\n\nMass of deuterium nucleus = 2.014 amu (atomic mass units)\nMass of helium-3 nucleus = 3.016 amu\nMass of a neutron = 1.008 amu\n\nTotal mass of reactants = 2 * (mass of deuterium nucleus) = 2 * 2.014 amu = 4.028 amu\nTotal mass of products = (mass of helium-3 nucleus) + (mass of neutron) = 3.016 amu + 1.008 amu = 4.024 amu\n\nMass defect (Δm) = Total mass of reactants - Total mass of products = 4.028 amu - 4.024 amu = 0.004 amu\n\nNow, we need to convert the mass defect from atomic mass units (amu) to kilograms (kg). 1 amu is approximately equal to 1.66054 × 10⁻²⁷ kg.\n\nΔm = 0.004 amu * (1.66054 × 10⁻²⁷ kg/amu) = 6.64216 × 10⁻³⁰ kg\n\nNow, we can use Einstein's equation, E=mc², to find the energy released in the reaction.\n\nE = Δm * c²\nwhere E is the energy released, Δm is the mass defect, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3 × 10⁸ m/s).\n\nE = (6.64216 × 10⁻³⁰ kg) * (3 × 10⁸ m/s)² = 5.97794 × 10⁻¹³ Joules\n\nSo, the energy released when two deuterium nuclei fuse to form helium-3 in a nuclear fusion reaction is approximately 5.98 × 10⁻¹³ Joules."
