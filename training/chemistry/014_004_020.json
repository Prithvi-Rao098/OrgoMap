    "message_2": "To calculate the crystal field stabilization energy (CFSE) for a tetrahedral complex, we need to consider the distribution of the unpaired electrons in the d-orbitals. In a tetrahedral complex, the d-orbitals are split into two groups: e (dxy, dxz, dyz) and t2 (dx²-y², dz²).\n\nFor a tetrahedral complex with three unpaired electrons, the electron configuration will be:\n\ne: ↑↑↑ (3 unpaired electrons)\nt2: empty\n\nNow, we can calculate the CFSE using the ligand field splitting parameter (Δt) and the number of unpaired electrons in each group:\n\nCFSE = -Δt * (number of electrons in e) + (2/3)Δt * (number of electrons in t2)\n\nIn this case, there are 3 electrons in the e orbitals and 0 electrons in the t2 orbitals:\n\nCFSE = -900 cm⁻¹ * 3 + (2/3) * 900 cm⁻¹ * 0\nCFSE = -2700 cm⁻¹\n\nSo, the crystal field stabilization energy (CFSE) for this tetrahedral complex is -2700 cm⁻¹."
