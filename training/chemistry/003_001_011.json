    "message_2": "The maximum amount of work that can be obtained from a chemical reaction at constant temperature and pressure is equal to the negative of the Gibbs free energy change of the reaction. In this case, the Gibbs free energy change is -20 kJ/mol.\n\nMaximum work = -Î”G = -(-20 kJ/mol) = 20 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the maximum amount of work that can be obtained from this reaction is 20 kJ/mol."
