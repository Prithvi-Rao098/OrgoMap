    "message_1": "What mass of copper will be deposited on a cathode using a current of 2.5 A for 20 minutes in a solution of copper sulfate (CuSO4) with a concentration of 0.1 mol/L? (Molar mass of copper= 63.55 g/mol and Faraday's constant = 96,485 C/mol)",
    "message_2": "To determine the mass of copper deposited on the cathode, we can use Faraday's laws of electrolysis. First, we need to find the total charge (Q) passed through the solution:\n\nQ = current (I) × time (t)\nwhere current (I) = 2.5 A and time (t) = 20 minutes = 20 × 60 = 1200 seconds\n\nQ = 2.5 A × 1200 s = 3000 C\n\nNext, we need to find the number of moles of electrons (n) transferred:\n\nn = Q / Faraday's constant (F)\nwhere Faraday's constant (F) = 96,485 C/mol\n\nn = 3000 C / 96,485 C/mol ≈ 0.0311 mol\n\nIn the reaction of copper sulfate, the copper ion (Cu²⁺) gains two electrons to form copper metal (Cu):\n\nCu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu\n\nSince the copper ion gains two electrons, we need to divide the moles of electrons by 2 to find the moles of copper deposited:\n\nmoles of Cu = 0.0311 mol / 2 = 0.01555 mol\n\nFinally, we can find the mass of copper deposited by multiplying the moles of copper by the molar mass of copper:\n\nmass of Cu = moles of Cu × molar mass of Cu\nwhere molar mass of Cu = 63.55 g/mol\n\nmass of Cu = 0.01555 mol × 63.55 g/mol ≈ 0.988 g\n\nTherefore, approximately 0.988 grams of copper will be deposited on the cathode."
