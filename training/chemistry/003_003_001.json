Write the rate law equation and determine the rate constant if the initial concentration of N2O5 is 0.1 mol/L and the half-life of the reaction is 50 seconds.",
    "message_2": "Since the reaction is first-order with respect to N2O5 and second-order overall, the rate law equation can be written as:\n\nRate = k[N2O5]^1\n\nwhere Rate is the reaction rate, k is the rate constant, and [N2O5] is the concentration of N2O5.\n\nNow, we need to determine the rate constant (k) using the given half-life (t1/2) and initial concentration of N2O5. For a first-order reaction, the half-life is related to the rate constant by the following equation:\n\nt1/2 = 0.693 / k\n\nGiven that the half-life is 50 seconds, we can solve for k:\n\n50 s = 0.693 / k\nk = 0.693 / 50 s\nk â‰ˆ 0.01386 s^(-1)\n\nSo, the rate law equation for the decomposition of N2O5 is:\n\nRate = 0.01386 [N2O5]"
