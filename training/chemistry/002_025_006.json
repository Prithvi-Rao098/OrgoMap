    "message_2": "Iron(III) chloride hexahydrate is a coordination compound with the formula FeCl₃·6H₂O. In this compound, the central metal ion is Fe(III), which has a +3 charge. The magnetic moment of a compound depends on the number of unpaired electrons in the central metal ion.\n\nThe electronic configuration of Fe is [Ar] 3d^6 4s^2. When it forms the Fe(III) ion, it loses 3 electrons, leaving it with the electronic configuration [Ar] 3d^5. This means there are 5 unpaired electrons in the Fe(III) ion.\n\nTo calculate the magnetic moment (μ) of the compound, we can use the formula:\n\nμ = √(n(n+2)) μB\n\nwhere n is the number of unpaired electrons and μB is the Bohr magneton (approximately 9.27 x 10^-24 J/T).\n\nFor Fe(III) ion with 5 unpaired electrons:\n\nμ = √(5(5+2)) μB\nμ = √(5(7)) μB\nμ = √35 μB\n\nTherefore, the magnetic moment of the compound Iron(III) chloride hexahydrate is approximately √35 μB or around 5.92 μB."
