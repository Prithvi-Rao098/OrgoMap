    "message_2": "The lattice energy of an ionic compound can be calculated using the Born-Lande equation:\n\nLE = -N * (M * Z+ * Z- * e^2) / (4 * π * ε0 * r0)\n\nWhere:\nLE = Lattice energy\nN = Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23 mol^-1)\nM = Madelung constant (for MgO, M = 1.748)\nZ+ = Charge of the cation (Mg2+ = +2)\nZ- = Charge of the anion (O2- = -2)\ne = Elementary charge (1.602 x 10^-19 C)\nε0 = Vacuum permittivity (8.854 x 10^-12 C^2 J^-1 m^-1)\nr0 = Distance between ions (sum of ionic radii)\n\nFirst, we need to find the distance between the ions (r0). The ionic radii for Mg2+ and O2- are given as 0.72 Å and 1.40 Å, respectively. To find r0, we need to convert the radii to meters and then add them together:\n\nr0 = (0.72 Å + 1.40 Å) * (1 x 10^-10 m/Å)\nr0 = (2.12 Å) * (1 x 10^-10 m/Å)\nr0 = 2.12 x 10^-10 m\n\nNow we can plug the values into the Born-Lande equation:\n\nLE = -N * (M * Z+ * Z- * e^2) / (4 * π * ε0 * r0)\nLE = -(6.022 x 10^23 mol^-1) * (1.748) * (2) * (-2) * (1.602 x 10^-19 C)^2 / (4 * π * (8.854 x 10^-12 C^2 J^-1 m^-1) * (2.12 x 10^-10 m))\n\nLE = -2.097 x 10^6 J/mol\n\nTo convert the lattice energy from J/mol to kJ/mol, we divide by 1000:\n\nLE = -2.097 x 10^6 J/mol * (1 kJ / 1000 J)\nLE = -2097 kJ/mol\n\nThe calculated lattice energy of magnesium oxide (MgO) is approximately -2097 kJ/mol. However, the given lattice energy of MgO is -3795 kJ/mol. This discrepancy may be due to the approximations used in the Born-Lande equation or the ionic radii values provided. In practice, experimental values are often used to refine these calculations."
