    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the given reaction, we can use Hess's Law, which states that the enthalpy change of a reaction is the sum of the enthalpy changes of the products minus the sum of the enthalpy changes of the reactants.\n\nThe reaction is:\n\n2HNO3(aq) + Ba(OH)2(aq) → Ba(NO3)2(aq) + 2H2O(l)\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for this reaction (ΔH°) can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nΔH° = [ΔHf°(products)] - [ΔHf°(reactants)]\n\nΔHf° values are given for each compound:\n\nΔHf° [HNO3(aq)] = -207.5 kJ/mol\nΔHf° [Ba(OH)2(aq)] = -994.0 kJ/mol\nΔHf° [Ba(NO3)2(aq)] = -537.5 kJ/mol\nΔHf° [H2O(l)] = -285.8 kJ/mol (this value is a standard value for the formation of liquid water)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔH° = [1 × (-537.5) + 2 × (-285.8)] - [2 × (-207.5) + 1 × (-994.0)]\n\nΔH° = [-537.5 - 571.6] - [-415.0 - 994.0]\n\nΔH° = [-1109.1] - [-1409.0]\n\nΔH° = 299.9 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the given reaction is 299.9 kJ."
