    "message_2": "To find the density of the solid, we can use the formula:\n\nDensity = mass/volume\n\nGiven the mass of zinc sulfide is 8.63 g and the volume is 2.5 cm³, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nDensity = 8.63 g / 2.5 cm³\n\nDensity = 3.452 g/cm³\n\nThe density of the solid made of zinc sulfide is 3.452 g/cm³."
