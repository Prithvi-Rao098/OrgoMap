    "message_2": "The rate of an inorganic reaction between hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3) is affected by temperature, as with most chemical reactions. The reaction between HCl and Na2S2O3 can be represented by the following balanced equation:\n\n2HCl(aq) + Na2S2O3(aq) â†’ 2NaCl(aq) + H2O(l) + SO2(g) + S(s)\n\nAs the temperature increases, the rate of this reaction also increases. This is because an increase in temperature leads to an increase in the kinetic energy of the reacting particles (molecules or ions). With more kinetic energy, the particles move faster and collide more frequently with each other. Additionally, a higher proportion of these collisions will have enough energy to overcome the activation energy barrier, which is the minimum energy required for a successful reaction to occur.\n\nThis relationship between temperature and reaction rate can be explained by the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk = Ae^(-Ea/RT)\n\nwhere k is the rate constant, A is the pre-exponential factor, Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. As the temperature (T) increases, the exponential term becomes larger, leading to an increase in the rate constant (k) and thus a faster reaction rate.\n\nIn summary, the rate of the inorganic reaction between hydrochloric acid and sodium thiosulfate increases with increasing temperature due to more frequent and energetic collisions between the reacting particles."
