    "message_1": "A 0.25 mol/L solution of ethanoic acid (CH3COOH) is mixed with a 0.40 mol/L solution of sodium acetate (CH3COONa). The equilibrium constant for the reaction CH3COOH + NaCH3COO ⇌ CH3COONa + H2O is 1.8 x 10^-5. What is the concentration of CH3COONa at equilibrium?",
    "message_2": "First, we need to recognize that the reaction is actually a buffer system with the following equilibrium reaction:\n\nCH3COOH (acetic acid) + H2O ⇌ CH3COO- (acetate ion) + H3O+ (hydronium ion)\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka, the acid dissociation constant, which is given as 1.8 x 10^-5.\n\nTo find the concentration of CH3COONa (sodium acetate) at equilibrium, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log ([A-]/[HA])\n\nwhere pH is the negative logarithm of the H3O+ concentration, pKa is the negative logarithm of Ka, [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate ion), and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid (acetic acid).\n\nFirst, we need to find the pKa:\n\npKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.8 x 10^-5) = 4.74\n\nNext, we need to find the initial concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion. Since sodium acetate dissociates completely in water, the initial concentration of acetate ion is 0.40 mol/L. The initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.25 mol/L.\n\nNow we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH of the solution:\n\npH = 4.74 + log ([0.40]/[0.25]) = 4.74 + log (1.6) ≈ 4.94\n\nSince the pH is less than 7, the solution is acidic, and there will be some dissociation of acetic acid. However, because the solution is a buffer, the concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion will not change significantly. Therefore, the concentration of CH3COONa (sodium acetate) at equilibrium will still be approximately 0.40 mol/L."
