    "message_2": "To calculate the bond order and bond length of the nitrogen-oxygen bond in the NO molecule using molecular orbital theory, we first need to determine the electronic configuration of the molecule.\n\nNitrogen (N) has 7 electrons, and Oxygen (O) has 8 electrons. So, the NO molecule has a total of 15 electrons. The molecular orbitals are filled in the following order: σ1s, σ*1s, σ2s, σ*2s, π2px, π2py, σ2pz, π*2px, π*2py, σ*2pz.\n\nNow, let's fill the molecular orbitals with the 15 electrons:\n1. σ1s: 2 electrons\n2. σ*1s: 2 electrons\n3. σ2s: 2 electrons\n4. σ*2s: 2 electrons\n5. π2px: 2 electrons\n6. π2py: 2 electrons\n7. σ2pz: 2 electrons\n8. π*2px: 1 electron\n\nThe bond order can be calculated using the formula:\n\nBond order = (Number of electrons in bonding orbitals - Number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\n\nBond order = (10 - 5) / 2 = 5 / 2 = 2.5\n\nThe bond order of the nitrogen-oxygen bond in the NO molecule is 2.5. This indicates that the bond is between a double bond and a triple bond, making it a strong bond.\n\nTo calculate the bond length, we can use the empirical formula:\n\nBond length = R₀ / (1 - exp(-β(BO - 1)))\n\nHere, R₀ and β are constants that depend on the specific atoms involved in the bond. For nitrogen and oxygen, R₀ = 1.10 Å and β = 0.4 Å^(-1).\n\nBond length = 1.10 / (1 - exp(-0.4(2.5 - 1)))\nBond length ≈ 1.10 / (1 - exp(-0.6))\nBond length ≈ 1.10 / (1 - 0.5488)\nBond length ≈ 1.10 / 0.4512\nBond length ≈ 2.44 Å\n\nThe bond length of the nitrogen-oxygen bond in the NO molecule is approximately 2.44 Å.\n\nIn conclusion, the nitrogen-oxygen bond in the NO molecule has a bond order of 2.5 and a bond length of approximately 2.44 Å. The bond is strong and lies between a double bond and a triple bond, indicating a high degree of electron sharing between the nitrogen and oxygen atoms."
