    "message_2": "To calculate the nuclear binding energy of a helium-4 nucleus, we first need to find the mass defect. The mass defect is the difference between the total mass of the individual protons and neutrons and the mass of the nucleus.\n\nA helium-4 nucleus contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons. The mass of a proton is approximately 1.00728 amu, and the mass of a neutron is approximately 1.00867 amu.\n\nTotal mass of 2 protons and 2 neutrons:\n(2 × 1.00728 amu) + (2 × 1.00867 amu) = 2.01456 amu + 2.01734 amu = 4.03190 amu\n\nMass defect:\n4.03190 amu - 4.00260 amu = 0.02930 amu\n\nNow, we need to convert the mass defect from atomic mass units to energy. We will use the famous Einstein's equation, E=mc², where E is energy, m is mass, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum (approximately 2.998 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass defect from amu to kilograms. 1 amu is approximately 1.66054 × 10^-27 kg.\n\nMass defect in kg:\n0.02930 amu × (1.66054 × 10^-27 kg/amu) = 4.864 × 10^-29 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the nuclear binding energy using E=mc²:\n\nE = (4.864 × 10^-29 kg) × (2.998 × 10^8 m/s)²\nE = 4.864 × 10^-29 kg × 8.987 × 10^16 m²/s²\nE = 4.370 × 10^-12 Joules\n\nTo express the nuclear binding energy in more common units, we can convert Joules to mega-electron volts (MeV). 1 Joule is approximately 6.242 × 10^12 MeV.\n\nE = 4.370 × 10^-12 Joules × (6.242 × 10^12 MeV/Joule)\nE ≈ 27.3 MeV\n\nSo, the nuclear binding energy of a helium-4 nucleus is approximately 27.3 MeV."
