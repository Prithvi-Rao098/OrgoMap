    "message_2": "To determine the diffusion coefficient of sodium chloride (NaCl) in water at 25°C and a concentration of 0.1 M, we can use the Stokes-Einstein equation:\n\nD = (k * T) / (6 * π * η * r)\n\nWhere:\nD = diffusion coefficient\nk = Boltzmann's constant (1.38 × 10^-23 J/K)\nT = temperature in Kelvin (25°C = 298 K)\nη = dynamic viscosity of the solvent (water) at 25°C (8.9 × 10^-4 Pa·s)\nr = hydrodynamic radius of the solute (NaCl)\n\nFirst, we need to find the hydrodynamic radius (r) of NaCl. The hydrodynamic radius can be estimated using the following equation:\n\nr = (3 * M) / (4 * π * ρ * N_A)\n\nWhere:\nM = molar mass of NaCl (58.44 g/mol)\nρ = density of NaCl (2.165 g/cm³ = 2165 kg/m³)\nN_A = Avogadro's number (6.022 × 10^23 mol^-1)\n\nr = (3 * 58.44) / (4 * π * 2165 * 6.022 × 10^23)\nr ≈ 2.82 × 10^-10 m\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Stokes-Einstein equation:\n\nD = (1.38 × 10^-23 * 298) / (6 * π * 8.9 × 10^-4 * 2.82 × 10^-10)\nD ≈ 1.334 × 10^-9 m²/s\n\nTherefore, the diffusion coefficient of sodium chloride (NaCl) in water at 25°C and a concentration of 0.1 M is approximately 1.334 × 10^-9 m²/s."
