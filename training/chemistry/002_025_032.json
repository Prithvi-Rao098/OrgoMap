    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic moment of nickel(II) chloride hexahydrate, we first need to find the number of unpaired electrons in the nickel(II) ion (Ni²⁺). The electronic configuration of Ni²⁺ is [Ar] 3d8, as you mentioned.\n\nIn the octahedral crystal field, the 3d orbitals split into two energy levels: the lower energy level (t₂g) consists of dxy, dyz, and dxz orbitals, and the higher energy level (e_g) consists of dx²-y² and dz² orbitals.\n\nFor a d8 configuration, the first six electrons will fill the t₂g orbitals, and the remaining two electrons will fill the e_g orbitals. The electron configuration in the octahedral field will be t₂g^6 e_g^2.\n\nSince all the electrons are paired, there are no unpaired electrons in the Ni²⁺ ion. Therefore, the magnetic moment of nickel(II) chloride hexahydrate is 0."
