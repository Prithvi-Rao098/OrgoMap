    "message_1": "A student carried out a chemical reaction in the laboratory and obtained 12 grams of the product. However, the theoretical yield of the product was 15 grams. Calculate the percent yield of the product.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the percent yield of the product, you can use the following formula:\n\nPercent Yield = (Actual Yield / Theoretical Yield) x 100\n\nIn this case, the actual yield is 12 grams, and the theoretical yield is 15 grams. Plugging these values into the formula:\n\nPercent Yield = (12 / 15) x 100\n\nPercent Yield = 0.8 x 100\n\nPercent Yield = 80%\n\nSo, the percent yield of the product is 80%."
