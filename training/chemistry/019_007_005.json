    "message_2": "To calculate the reaction quotient Q for the given reaction, we need to use the formula:\n\nQ = [Products]^coefficients / [Reactants]^coefficients\n\nFor the given reaction, 2H2(g) + O2(g) -> 2H2O(g), the balanced equation shows the coefficients for each species. The formula for Q becomes:\n\nQ = [H2O]^2 / ([H2]^2 * [O2])\n\nNow, we can plug in the given concentrations:\n\nQ = ([0.08]^2) / (([0.10]^2) * [0.05])\n\nQ = (0.0064) / (0.01 * 0.05)\n\nQ = 0.0064 / 0.0005\n\nQ = 12.8\n\nThe reaction quotient Q for the given reaction at the specified concentrations is 12.8."
