    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction, we can use the formula:\n\nKc = [SO3]^2 / ([SO2]^2 * [O2])\n\nGiven the concentrations of the reactants and products at equilibrium:\n\n[SO2] = 1.20 M\n[O2] = 0.80 M\n[SO3] = 0.50 M\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nKc = (0.50)^2 / ((1.20)^2 * (0.80))\n\nKc = 0.25 / (1.44 * 0.80)\n\nKc = 0.25 / 1.152\n\nKc ≈ 0.217\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction at 1000 K is approximately 0.217."
