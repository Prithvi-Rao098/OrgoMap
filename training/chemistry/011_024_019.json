    "message_2": "To investigate the effects of substituent groups on the supramolecular properties of a hexaamminecobalt(III) complex using computational chemistry methods, follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose the substituent groups: Select a range of substituent groups with varying electronic and steric properties. For example, you can choose electron-donating groups (e.g., -NH2, -OH), electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., -NO2, -CF3), and sterically demanding groups (e.g., -tBu, -Ph).\n\n2. Build the molecular models: Construct the hexaamminecobalt(III) complex models with the chosen substituent groups using a molecular modeling software, such as Gaussian, ORCA, or GAMESS. Ensure that the cobalt(III) center is coordinated to six ammine ligands, and the substituent groups are attached to the nitrogen atoms of the ammine ligands.\n\n3. Optimize the molecular geometries: Perform geometry optimizations for each of the substituted hexaamminecobalt(III) complexes using an appropriate level of theory, such as density functional theory (DFT) or ab initio methods (e.g., Hartree-Fock, MP2). Choose a suitable basis set, such as 6-31G(d,p) or 6-311+G(2d,p), and ensure that the optimized structures have no imaginary frequencies.\n\n4. Calculate the supramolecular properties: Evaluate the supramolecular properties of interest, such as binding energies, hydrogen bonding interactions, and electrostatic potentials, for each of the optimized structures. You can use the same level of theory and basis set as in the geometry optimization step.\n\n5. Analyze the results: Compare the calculated supramolecular properties of the substituted hexaamminecobalt(III) complexes to those of the unsubstituted complex. Investigate the trends in the data and determine the influence of the substituent groups on the supramolecular properties. For example, you can analyze how electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups affect the binding energies or hydrogen bonding interactions.\n\n6. Validate the findings: Perform additional calculations, such as natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis or atoms in molecules (AIM) analysis, to gain further insights into the electronic structure and bonding interactions of the substituted hexaamminecobalt(III) complexes. This will help validate the findings from the previous steps and provide a deeper understanding of the effects of the substituent groups on the supramolecular properties.\n\n7. Report the results: Summarize your findings in a clear and concise manner, highlighting the key trends and conclusions. Discuss the implications of your results for the design and synthesis of new hexaamminecobalt(III) complexes with tailored supramolecular properties."
