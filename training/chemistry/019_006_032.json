    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question for the student:\n\nDetermine the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the following chemical reaction at 298 K, if the initial concentrations of reactants and products are [NO2] = 0.025 M, [O2] = 0.050 M and [NO] = [O3] = 0 M at equilibrium.\n   \n2 NO2(g) + O2(g) <--> 2 NO(g) + 2 O3(g) \n\nNote: The reaction is carried out in a sealed container at constant volume.",
    "message_2": "To determine the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction, we first need to find the equilibrium concentrations of all the species involved. Let's denote the change in concentration of each species as x.\n\nAt equilibrium, the concentrations will be:\n[NO2] = 0.025 - 2x\n[O2] = 0.050 - x\n[NO] = 2x\n[O3] = 2x\n\nNow, we can write the expression for the equilibrium constant (Kc):\n\nKc = ([NO]^2 * [O3]^2) / ([NO2]^2 * [O2])\n\nSubstitute the equilibrium concentrations into the Kc expression:\n\nKc = ((2x)^2 * (2x)^2) / ((0.025 - 2x)^2 * (0.050 - x))\n\nSince we don't have the value of Kc, we cannot solve for x directly. However, we can provide a general expression for Kc in terms of x:\n\nKc = (16x^4) / ((0.025 - 2x)^2 * (0.050 - x))\n\nTo find the numerical value of Kc, you would need additional information, such as the equilibrium concentrations of the species or the value of Kc itself."
