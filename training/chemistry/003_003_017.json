    "message_2": "To find the rate constant (k) of a first-order reaction, we can use the relationship between the half-life (t1/2) and the rate constant:\n\nt1/2 = 0.693 / k\n\nGiven that the half-life (t1/2) is 10 minutes, we can plug this value into the equation and solve for k:\n\n10 minutes = 0.693 / k\n\nNow, we can rearrange the equation to solve for k:\n\nk = 0.693 / 10 minutes\n\nk â‰ˆ 0.0693 min^(-1)\n\nSo, the rate constant (k) of this first-order reaction is approximately 0.0693 min^(-1). Note that the initial concentration of the reactant is not needed to determine the rate constant for a first-order reaction, as it only affects the reaction rate, not the rate constant."
