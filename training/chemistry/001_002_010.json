    "message_2": "The given pair of compounds are:\n\n1. CH3CH2CH2OH (1-propanol)\n2. CH3CH2OCH3 (methoxyethane)\n\nThese two compounds have the same molecular formula (C3H8O) but different connectivity of atoms and functional groups. This type of isomerism is called constitutional isomerism or structural isomerism."
