    "message_2": "The bond angle in a water molecule (H2O) is approximately 104.5 degrees. This bond angle can be predicted using the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory and the electron pair geometry of the molecule.\n\nAccording to the VSEPR theory, the electron pairs around the central atom will arrange themselves in a way that minimizes the repulsion between them. In the case of a water molecule, the central atom is oxygen, which has two lone pairs of electrons and two bonding pairs of electrons (one for each hydrogen atom).\n\nThe electron pair geometry of the water molecule is tetrahedral, as there are four electron pairs (two lone pairs and two bonding pairs) around the oxygen atom. However, the molecular geometry, which describes the arrangement of atoms in the molecule, is bent or angular due to the presence of the two lone pairs.\n\nThe bond angle in a perfect tetrahedral geometry would be 109.5 degrees. However, in the case of a water molecule, the presence of the two lone pairs on the oxygen atom causes a greater repulsion between the lone pairs and the bonding pairs, pushing the hydrogen atoms closer together. This results in a smaller bond angle of approximately 104.5 degrees."
