    "message_2": "To improve the yield of benzocaine in the preparation process from p-aminobenzoic acid and ethanol while maintaining the purity of the final product, you can consider the following strategies:\n\n1. Optimize reaction conditions: Ensure that the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and reaction time, are optimal for the formation of benzocaine. For example, the reaction is typically carried out at room temperature or slightly above, and the reaction time can be adjusted to ensure complete conversion of p-aminobenzoic acid to benzocaine.\n\n2. Use a suitable catalyst: Employing a suitable catalyst, such as a strong acid like sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid, can increase the rate of the reaction and improve the yield. The catalyst should be used in an appropriate amount to avoid side reactions and impurities.\n\n3. Monitor the stoichiometry: Ensure that the stoichiometry of the reactants is appropriate. Using an excess of ethanol can help drive the reaction to completion, but care should be taken not to use too much excess, as this can lead to impurities and difficulties in purification.\n\n4. Improve the purification process: After the reaction is complete, the purification process should be optimized to separate benzocaine from any unreacted starting materials, byproducts, and impurities. Common purification techniques include recrystallization, filtration, and chromatography. Choosing the right solvent system and optimizing the purification conditions can help improve the purity of the final product.\n\n5. Monitor the reaction progress: Regularly analyze the reaction mixture using techniques like thin-layer chromatography (TLC) or high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to monitor the progress of the reaction and ensure that it is proceeding as desired. This can help identify any issues with the reaction and allow for adjustments to be made to improve the yield and purity.\n\nBy carefully optimizing the reaction conditions, using a suitable catalyst, monitoring the stoichiometry, improving the purification process, and monitoring the reaction progress, it is possible to improve the yield of benzocaine while maintaining the purity of the final product."
