    "message_1": "Identify the type of bonding present in potassium iodide (KI) and explain how it influences the physical properties of the compound.",
    "message_2": "Potassium iodide (KI) is an ionic compound, which means it is formed by the electrostatic attraction between positively charged potassium ions (K+) and negatively charged iodide ions (I-). This type of bonding occurs when a metal (in this case, potassium) transfers one or more electrons to a non-metal (iodine) to achieve a stable electron configuration.\n\nThe ionic bonding in potassium iodide influences its physical properties in several ways:\n\n1. High melting and boiling points: Due to the strong electrostatic forces between the oppositely charged ions, KI has high melting and boiling points (melting point: 681°C, boiling point: 1,330°C). A significant amount of energy is required to overcome these forces and change the compound from a solid to a liquid or a gas.\n\n2. Solubility in water: Potassium iodide is highly soluble in water. When KI is dissolved in water, the polar water molecules surround the K+ and I- ions, effectively separating them and allowing them to dissolve. This is because the positively charged hydrogen atoms in water are attracted to the negatively charged iodide ions, while the negatively charged oxygen atoms in water are attracted to the positively charged potassium ions.\n\n3. Electrical conductivity: In the solid state, KI does not conduct electricity because the ions are held in a fixed lattice structure and are not free to move. However, when KI is dissolved in water or melted, the ions become free to move, allowing the substance to conduct electricity.\n\n4. Brittleness: Ionic compounds like potassium iodide are generally brittle. This is because when pressure is applied to the crystal lattice, the ions may shift in such a way that ions with the same charge are brought closer together. Since like charges repel each other, this causes the lattice to break apart, resulting in the brittleness of the compound."
