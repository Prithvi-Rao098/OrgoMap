    "message_2": "To calculate the standard electrode potential (E°) for the overall reaction, we need to determine which half-reaction is being reduced and which is being oxidized. Then, we can use the standard reduction potentials given to find the E° for the overall reaction.\n\nIn the overall reaction:\n2H⁺(aq) + Fe³⁺(aq) → H₂(g) + Fe²⁺(aq)\n\nWe can see that:\n- Hydrogen ions (H⁺) are gaining electrons to form hydrogen gas (H₂), so this half-reaction is being reduced.\n- Iron(III) ions (Fe³⁺) are losing an electron to form iron(II) ions (Fe²⁺), so this half-reaction is being oxidized.\n\nNow, we can use the standard reduction potentials given for each half-reaction:\n\nReduction half-reaction: 2H⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → H₂(g)          E° = 0.00V\nOxidation half-reaction: Fe³⁺(aq) + e⁻ → Fe²⁺(aq)        E° = +0.77V\n\nSince the reduction half-reaction is already given, we don't need to change it. However, we need to reverse the oxidation half-reaction to represent the actual process occurring in the overall reaction:\n\nReversed oxidation half-reaction: Fe²⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + e⁻\n\nWhen we reverse the half-reaction, we also need to change the sign of the standard reduction potential:\n\nReversed oxidation half-reaction E°: -0.77V\n\nNow, we can add the standard reduction potentials of the two half-reactions to find the E° for the overall reaction:\n\nE°(overall) = E°(reduction) + E°(reversed oxidation)\nE°(overall) = 0.00V + (-0.77V)\nE°(overall) = -0.77V\n\nSo, the standard electrode potential (E°) for the overall reaction at 298K is -0.77V."
