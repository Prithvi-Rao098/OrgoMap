    "message_2": "To calculate the surface tension of water, we can use the formula for the capillary rise method:\n\nSurface tension (γ) = (hρgR) / 2\n\nwhere h is the height of the water droplet, ρ is the density of water, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and R is the radius of the droplet.\n\nFirst, we need to find the volume of the water droplet:\n\nWeight = Volume × Density\n0.2 g = Volume × 1 g/cm³\nVolume = 0.2 cm³\n\nNext, we can find the radius of the droplet:\n\nDiameter = 5 mm = 0.5 cm\nRadius (R) = Diameter / 2 = 0.5 cm / 2 = 0.25 cm\n\nNow, we can find the height of the droplet using the formula for the volume of a sphere:\n\nVolume = (4/3)πR³\n0.2 cm³ = (4/3)π(0.25 cm)³\n0.2 cm³ = (4/3)π(0.015625 cm³)\n0.2 cm³ / (4/3)π = 0.015625 cm³\nh = 0.015625 cm³ / 0.015625 cm²\nh = 1 cm\n\nNow we can calculate the surface tension using the capillary rise method formula:\n\nγ = (hρgR) / 2\nγ = (1 cm × 1 g/cm³ × 980 cm/s² × 0.25 cm) / 2\nγ = (245 dynes/cm) / 2\nγ = 122.5 dynes/cm\n\nThe surface tension of water in this case is approximately 122.5 dynes/cm."
