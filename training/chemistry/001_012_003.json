    "message_2": "Primary, secondary, and tertiary amines are organic compounds containing nitrogen atoms with different numbers of carbon-containing groups (alkyl or aryl groups) attached to them. The basicity of amines is determined by the availability of the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom for donation to a proton (H+). Here's a brief comparison of the three types of amines:\n\n1. Primary amines (1° amines): In primary amines, the nitrogen atom is bonded to one carbon-containing group and two hydrogen atoms. They generally have higher basicity compared to secondary and tertiary amines due to the presence of more hydrogen atoms, which makes the nitrogen's lone pair more available for donation.\n\nExample: Methylamine (CH3NH2)\nCorresponding amide: Methanamide (HCONH2)\n\n2. Secondary amines (2° amines): In secondary amines, the nitrogen atom is bonded to two carbon-containing groups and one hydrogen atom. The basicity of secondary amines is lower than primary amines because the electron-donating effect of the alkyl groups reduces the availability of the nitrogen's lone pair for donation.\n\nExample: Dimethylamine ((CH3)2NH)\nCorresponding amide: N-Methylmethanamide (HCON(CH3))\n\n3. Tertiary amines (3° amines): In tertiary amines, the nitrogen atom is bonded to three carbon-containing groups and has no hydrogen atoms directly attached. The basicity of tertiary amines is the lowest among the three types of amines due to the electron-donating effect of the three alkyl groups, which further reduces the availability of the nitrogen's lone pair for donation.\n\nExample: Trimethylamine ((CH3)3N)\nCorresponding amide: N,N-Dimethylmethanamide (HCO(N(CH3)2))\n\nIn summary, primary amines have the highest basicity, followed by secondary amines, and tertiary amines have the lowest basicity. This trend is due to the electron-donating effect of the alkyl groups attached to the nitrogen atom, which reduces the availability of the nitrogen's lone pair for donation to a proton (H+)."
