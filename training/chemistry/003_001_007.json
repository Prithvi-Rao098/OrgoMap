    "message_2": "To calculate the change in enthalpy (ΔHrxn) for the given reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔHrxn = Σ [ΔHf°(products)] - Σ [ΔHf°(reactants)]\n\nFor the products, we have 2 moles of SO3(g), so we multiply the ΔHf°(SO3(g)) by 2:\n\nΔHf°(2SO3(g)) = 2 * (-395.71 kJ/mol) = -791.42 kJ/mol\n\nFor the reactants, we have 2 moles of SO2(g) and 1 mole of O2(g), so we multiply the ΔHf°(SO2(g)) by 2 and add the ΔHf°(O2(g)):\n\nΔHf°(2SO2(g) + O2(g)) = 2 * (-296.84 kJ/mol) + 0 kJ/mol = -593.68 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔHrxn = (-791.42 kJ/mol) - (-593.68 kJ/mol)\n\nΔHrxn = -791.42 kJ/mol + 593.68 kJ/mol\n\nΔHrxn = -197.74 kJ/mol\n\nThe change in enthalpy (ΔHrxn) for the given reaction at 25°C is -197.74 kJ/mol."
