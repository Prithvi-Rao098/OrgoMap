    "message_1": "What is the rate of the electrochemical reaction if a current of 0.2 A is passed through a solution of silver nitrate for 10 minutes, depositing 0.3 g of silver on the cathode?",
    "message_2": "To determine the rate of the electrochemical reaction, we need to find the number of moles of silver deposited and then divide it by the time taken for the reaction.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of moles of silver deposited:\nSilver has a molar mass of 107.87 g/mol.\n\nmoles of silver = mass of silver / molar mass of silver\nmoles of silver = 0.3 g / 107.87 g/mol\nmoles of silver ≈ 0.00278 mol\n\nNow, let's convert the time to seconds:\n10 minutes = 10 * 60 = 600 seconds\n\nFinally, let's find the rate of the electrochemical reaction:\nrate = moles of silver / time\nrate = 0.00278 mol / 600 s\nrate ≈ 4.63 × 10^(-6) mol/s\n\nThe rate of the electrochemical reaction is approximately 4.63 × 10^(-6) mol/s."
