    "message_2": "The type of chemical bonding present in a solid compound that conducts electricity in the molten state but does not conduct in the solid state is ionic bonding. In an ionic compound, the ions are held together by strong electrostatic forces in a lattice structure. In the solid state, the ions are not free to move, so the compound does not conduct electricity. However, when the compound is melted or dissolved in water, the ions become free to move, allowing the compound to conduct electricity."
