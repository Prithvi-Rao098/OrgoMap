    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the formula:\n\nΔH = ΣnΔHf(products) - ΣnΔHf(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH is the enthalpy change, n is the number of moles, and ΔHf is the standard enthalpy of formation.\n\nFor the products, we have 2 moles of CO2 and 6 moles of H2O:\nΣnΔHf(products) = (2 mol CO2 × -393.5 kJ/mol CO2) + (6 mol H2O × -285.8 kJ/mol H2O)\nΣnΔHf(products) = (-787.0 kJ) + (-1714.8 kJ) = -2501.8 kJ\n\nFor the reactants, we have 3 moles of CH4 and 4 moles of O2:\nΣnΔHf(reactants) = (3 mol CH4 × -74.8 kJ/mol CH4) + (4 mol O2 × 0 kJ/mol O2)\nΣnΔHf(reactants) = (-224.4 kJ) + (0 kJ) = -224.4 kJ\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction:\nΔH = ΣnΔHf(products) - ΣnΔHf(reactants)\nΔH = (-2501.8 kJ) - (-224.4 kJ)\nΔH = -2277.4 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change for the reaction is -2277.4 kJ."
