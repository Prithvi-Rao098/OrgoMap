    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the sublimation of iodine (I2), we need to consider the two processes involved: fusion (melting) and vaporization. Sublimation is the direct transition from solid to gas, so we can add the enthalpy changes for fusion and vaporization to find the enthalpy change for sublimation.\n\nStandard enthalpy change for sublimation (ΔH_sub) = Standard enthalpy of fusion (ΔH_fus) + Standard enthalpy of vaporization (ΔH_vap)\n\nGiven:\nΔH_fus = 15.52 kJ/mol\nΔH_vap = 41.57 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_sub = 15.52 kJ/mol + 41.57 kJ/mol\nΔH_sub = 57.09 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the sublimation of iodine (I2) is 57.09 kJ/mol."
