    "message_2": "To calculate the pH of a solution with a concentration of 0.01 M hydrochloric acid (HCl), we can use the formula:\n\npH = -log10[H+]\n\nSince HCl is a strong acid, it will dissociate completely in water, meaning that the concentration of H+ ions will be equal to the concentration of HCl. In this case, the concentration of H+ ions is 0.01 M.\n\nNow we can plug this value into the formula:\n\npH = -log10(0.01)\n\npH = -(-2)\n\npH = 2\n\nSo, the pH of a solution with a concentration of 0.01 M hydrochloric acid is 2."
