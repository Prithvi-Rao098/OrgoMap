    "message_2": "The Lewis structure of the water molecule (H2O) is as follows:\n\n      O\n     / \\\n    H   H\n\nIn this structure, the oxygen atom (O) is in the center, with two hydrogen atoms (H) bonded to it. The oxygen atom has two lone pairs of electrons, which are not shown in the simplified structure above. The complete Lewis structure, including lone pairs, would look like this:\n\n      O\n    : / \\\n    H   H\n\nHere, the colons (:) represent the two lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen atom."
