    "message_2": "When the volume of the container is decreased from 5L to 2L while keeping the temperature constant, the pressure inside the container will increase. According to Le Chatelier's principle, the equilibrium will shift in the direction that reduces the pressure. In this case, it will shift towards the side with fewer moles of gas.\n\nThe reaction is:\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g)\n\nOn the left side of the reaction, there are 1 mole of N2 and 3 moles of H2, totaling 4 moles of gas. On the right side, there are 2 moles of NH3. Since there are fewer moles of gas on the right side, the equilibrium will shift to the right, favoring the formation of NH3.\n\nAs the equilibrium shifts to the right, the concentration of N2 and H2 will decrease, while the concentration of NH3 will increase. To determine the new concentrations, we can use the initial concentrations and the reaction stoichiometry.\n\nLet's assume the initial concentrations of N2, H2, and NH3 are [N2]0, [H2]0, and [NH3]0, respectively. When the volume is decreased to 2L, the new concentrations will be:\n\n[N2] = [N2]0 * (5L / 2L) = 2.5 * [N2]0\n[H2] = [H2]0 * (5L / 2L) = 2.5 * [H2]0\n[NH3] = [NH3]0 * (5L / 2L) = 2.5 * [NH3]0\n\nAs the equilibrium shifts to the right, the concentrations will change according to the stoichiometry:\n\n[N2] = 2.5 * [N2]0 - x\n[H2] = 2.5 * [H2]0 - 3x\n[NH3] = 2.5 * [NH3]0 + 2x\n\nWhere x is the amount of N2 and H2 consumed in the reaction. Since the equilibrium shifts to the right, the concentration of N2 and H2 will decrease, and the concentration of NH3 will increase."
