    "message_2": "To selectively protect a phenol group in the presence of a primary alcohol group during organic synthesis, you can use a protecting group that specifically reacts with phenols and not primary alcohols. One such protecting group is the tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS) group.\n\nHere's a general procedure for selectively protecting a phenol group:\n\n1. Dissolve the compound containing both the phenol and primary alcohol groups in an anhydrous solvent, such as dry dichloromethane (DCM) or dry tetrahydrofuran (THF).\n\n2. Add an excess of tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBSCl) to the reaction mixture. TBSCl is the reagent that will react with the phenol group to form the TBS-protected phenol.\n\n3. Add a catalytic amount of 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) to the reaction mixture. DMAP acts as a catalyst to promote the reaction between the phenol group and TBSCl.\n\n4. Add an organic base, such as imidazole or triethylamine (TEA), to the reaction mixture. The base will neutralize the HCl generated during the reaction and facilitate the formation of the TBS-protected phenol.\n\n5. Stir the reaction mixture at room temperature for several hours or until the reaction is complete. You can monitor the progress of the reaction using thin-layer chromatography (TLC) or another analytical technique.\n\n6. Once the reaction is complete, quench the reaction mixture with water or a saturated aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate. Extract the organic layer, wash it with water, and then dry it over anhydrous magnesium sulfate or sodium sulfate.\n\n7. Filter the drying agent and concentrate the organic layer under reduced pressure to obtain the crude product. Purify the product using column chromatography or another suitable purification technique.\n\nThe phenol group will be selectively protected as the TBS ether, while the primary alcohol group remains unprotected. Later in the synthesis, you can remove the TBS protecting group using a mild acidic condition, such as treatment with tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) or hydrofluoric acid (HF) in pyridine."
