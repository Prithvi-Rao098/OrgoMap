    "message_2": "To determine the change in solubility of silver chloride (AgCl) when the concentration of sodium chloride (NaCl) is increased, we need to consider the common ion effect. The common ion effect states that the solubility of a sparingly soluble salt is decreased when a common ion is added to the solution.\n\nThe solubility product constant (Ksp) expression for AgCl is:\n\nKsp = [Ag+][Cl-]\n\nSince NaCl is a strong electrolyte, it will completely dissociate into Na+ and Cl- ions in the solution. When the concentration of NaCl is increased, the concentration of Cl- ions in the solution will also increase.\n\nLet's first find the solubility of AgCl in the presence of 0.1M NaCl:\n\nKsp = [Ag+][Cl-]\n1.6 x 10^-10 = [Ag+][0.1 + x]\n\nAssuming x << 0.1, we can approximate:\n1.6 x 10^-10 = [Ag+][0.1]\n\n[Ag+] = 1.6 x 10^-9 M\n\nNow, let's find the solubility of AgCl in the presence of 0.5M NaCl:\n\nKsp = [Ag+][Cl-]\n1.6 x 10^-10 = [Ag+][0.5 + x]\n\nAssuming x << 0.5, we can approximate:\n1.6 x 10^-10 = [Ag+][0.5]\n\n[Ag+] = 3.2 x 10^-10 M\n\nNow, we can find the change in solubility:\n\nChange in solubility = Solubility with 0.1M NaCl - Solubility with 0.5M NaCl\nChange in solubility = (1.6 x 10^-9) - (3.2 x 10^-10)\n\nChange in solubility = 1.28 x 10^-9 M\n\nSo, the change in the solubility of silver chloride (AgCl) when the concentration of sodium chloride (NaCl) in the solution is increased from 0.1M to 0.5M is 1.28 x 10^-9 M."
