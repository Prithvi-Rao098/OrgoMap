Given the following information:\n\n- Heat of solution of anhydrous CuSO4: -74.9 kJ/mol\n- Enthalpy change of hydration of CuSO4路5H2O: -245.1 kJ/mol",
    "message_2": "To calculate the heat of hydration of anhydrous copper(II) sulfate (CuSO4), we can use the following equation:\n\nHeat of hydration = Enthalpy change of hydration of CuSO4路5H2O - Heat of solution of anhydrous CuSO4\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nHeat of hydration = (-245.1 kJ/mol) - (-74.9 kJ/mol)\n\nHeat of hydration = -245.1 kJ/mol + 74.9 kJ/mol\n\nHeat of hydration = -170.2 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the heat of hydration of 1 mole of anhydrous copper(II) sulfate (CuSO4) when it is dissolved in water to form its hydrated form, CuSO4路5H2O, is -170.2 kJ/mol."
