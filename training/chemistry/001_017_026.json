    "message_2": "In methanol (CH3OH), the oxidation state of carbon can be determined by assigning oxidation numbers to each atom in the molecule. \n\n1. Hydrogen has an oxidation number of +1.\n2. Oxygen has an oxidation number of -2.\n\nIn methanol, there are three hydrogen atoms bonded to the carbon atom, and one oxygen atom bonded to the hydrogen atom.\n\nLet's assign the oxidation number of carbon as x.\n\nSo, the equation for the oxidation numbers in methanol is:\n\nx + 3(+1) + (-2) = 0\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx + 3 - 2 = 0\nx + 1 = 0\nx = -1\n\nTherefore, the oxidation state of carbon in methanol is -1."
