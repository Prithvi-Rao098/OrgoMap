    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which relates the pH of a solution to the pKa of the weak acid and the concentrations of the acid and its conjugate base:\n\npH = pKa + log ([A-]/[HA])\n\nIn this case, acetic acid (CH3COOH) is the weak acid, and sodium acetate (CH3COONa) is its conjugate base. The pKa of acetic acid is 4.74.\n\nFirst, we need to find the concentrations of the acid ([HA]) and its conjugate base ([A-]). Since the solution contains 0.1 M acetic acid and 0.1 M sodium acetate, we have:\n\n[HA] = 0.1 M (concentration of acetic acid)\n[A-] = 0.1 M (concentration of acetate ions from sodium acetate)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = 4.74 + log (0.1/0.1)\n\npH = 4.74 + log (1)\n\npH = 4.74 + 0\n\npH = 4.74\n\nThe pH of the solution is 4.74. Since the pH is less than 7, the solution is acidic."
