    "message_1": "What is the polarity of the bond between nitrogen and oxygen in the molecule NO2?",
    "message_2": "In the molecule NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), the bond between nitrogen and oxygen is polar. This is because nitrogen and oxygen have different electronegativities, with oxygen being more electronegative than nitrogen. As a result, the electrons in the bond are pulled more towards the oxygen atom, creating a dipole moment and making the bond polar."
