    "message_2": "Americium-241 (Am-241) primarily undergoes alpha decay, in which it emits an alpha particle (consisting of 2 protons and 2 neutrons) and transforms into Neptunium-237 (Np-237). The decay equation for this process is:\n\nAm-241 → Np-237 + α\n\nThe half-life of Am-241 is approximately 432.2 years. This means that after 432.2 years, half of the initial amount of Am-241 will have decayed into Np-237.\n\nIn terms of safety in nuclear power sources, the relatively long half-life of Am-241 has both advantages and disadvantages. On one hand, the long half-life means that Am-241 can provide a relatively stable and long-lasting energy source, as it takes a significant amount of time for the material to decay. This makes it suitable for applications like radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs), which are used to power spacecraft and remote facilities.\n\nOn the other hand, the long half-life also means that Am-241 remains radioactive for a long time, posing potential safety risks. Alpha particles can be stopped by a sheet of paper or the outer layer of human skin, so they are not a significant hazard if the material is properly contained. However, if Am-241 is ingested or inhaled, it can cause significant internal damage due to the ionizing nature of alpha particles. Therefore, proper handling, containment, and disposal of Am-241 are crucial to ensure safety in nuclear power sources."
