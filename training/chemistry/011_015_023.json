    "message_2": "The most stable geometric structure of a Fe(CO)5 complex molecule, as predicted by ab initio calculations, is a trigonal bipyramidal geometry. In this structure, the iron (Fe) atom is at the center, and the five carbonyl (CO) ligands are arranged with three in the equatorial plane and two in the axial positions.\n\nThe electronic configuration of the Fe(CO)5 complex can be determined by considering the 18-electron rule, which states that a stable transition metal complex will have a total of 18 valence electrons when counting both the metal and the ligands. In the case of Fe(CO)5, the iron atom has 8 valence electrons (as it is in the +2 oxidation state), and each carbonyl ligand contributes 2 electrons, resulting in a total of 18 valence electrons.\n\nThe electronic configuration of the Fe(CO)5 complex can be represented as follows:\n\nFe: [Ar] 3d6 4s0\nCO: [He] 2s2 2p4\n\nWhen the carbonyl ligands form a bond with the iron atom, they donate a pair of electrons to the metal, forming a metal-to-ligand Ï€-backbonding. This results in the following electronic configuration for the Fe(CO)5 complex:\n\nFe(CO)5: [Ar] 3d8 4s0\n\nThis electronic configuration and the trigonal bipyramidal geometry contribute to the stability of the Fe(CO)5 complex."
