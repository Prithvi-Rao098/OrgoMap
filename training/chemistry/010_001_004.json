    "message_2": "To calculate the standard potential of the cell, we need to use the Nernst equation:\n\nE_cell = E°_cell - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\n\nwhere:\nE_cell = cell potential\nE°_cell = standard cell potential\nR = gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\nT = temperature in Kelvin (25°C = 298.15 K)\nn = number of electrons transferred in the redox reaction\nF = Faraday's constant (96,485 C/mol)\nQ = reaction quotient\n\nFirst, we need to determine the standard cell potential (E°_cell). This can be found by subtracting the standard reduction potential of the anode from the standard reduction potential of the cathode:\n\nE°_cell = E°_cathode - E°_anode\n\nThe standard reduction potentials for the half-reactions are:\n\nAg+(aq) + e- → Ag(s)  E° = +0.799 V\nCu2+(aq) + 2e- → Cu(s)  E° = +0.337 V\n\nSince Cu2+ is reduced and Ag+ is oxidized, the standard cell potential is:\n\nE°_cell = (+0.337 V) - (+0.799 V) = -0.462 V\n\nNow, we need to determine the reaction quotient (Q). The balanced redox reaction is:\n\n2Ag+(aq) + Cu(s) → 2Ag(s) + Cu2+(aq)\n\nThe reaction quotient is given by:\n\nQ = [Cu2+] / [Ag+]^2\n\nSubstitute the given concentrations:\n\nQ = (1.00 M) / (0.0100 M)^2 = 10000\n\nNow we can use the Nernst equation to find the cell potential:\n\nE_cell = E°_cell - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\nE_cell = -0.462 V - ((8.314 J/mol·K) * (298.15 K) / (2 * 96485 C/mol)) * ln(10000)\nE_cell = -0.462 V - (0.01299 V) * ln(10000)\nE_cell = -0.462 V - (0.01299 V) * 9.2103\nE_cell ≈ -0.582 V\n\nSo, the standard potential of the cell at 25°C is approximately -0.582 V."
