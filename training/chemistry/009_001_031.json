    "message_1": "A sample of iodine-131 has a half-life of 8 days. If a hospital starts with a 1.0g sample of iodine-131, how many grams of iodine-131 will be left after 32 days?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the half-life formula:\n\nFinal amount = Initial amount * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial amount of iodine-131 is 1.0g, the half-life is 8 days, and the time elapsed is 32 days. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal amount = 1.0g * (1/2)^(32 days / 8 days)\n\nFinal amount = 1.0g * (1/2)^4\n\nFinal amount = 1.0g * (1/16)\n\nFinal amount = 0.0625g\n\nAfter 32 days, there will be 0.0625 grams of iodine-131 left."
