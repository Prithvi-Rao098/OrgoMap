    "message_2": "When ethylene oxide is reacted with a silver catalyst, the major byproduct formed is ethylene glycol dimethyl ether (also known as 1,2-dimethoxyethane or glyme). The reaction proceeds through the formation of a silver alkoxide intermediate, which then reacts with another molecule of ethylene oxide to form the ether product."
