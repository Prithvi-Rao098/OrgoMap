How much heat is produced when you burn 5.00 grams of methane (CH4) at a constant pressure of 1 atm, assuming that the products are carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) and that the heat capacity of the calorimeter is negligible?",
    "message_2": "To determine the heat produced when burning 5.00 grams of methane, we first need to convert the mass of methane to moles. The molar mass of methane (CH4) is 12.01 g/mol (for carbon) + 4 * 1.01 g/mol (for hydrogen) = 16.05 g/mol.\n\nNow, we can convert the mass of methane to moles:\n5.00 g CH4 * (1 mol CH4 / 16.05 g CH4) = 0.3115 mol CH4\n\nThe enthalpy change (∆H) for the combustion of methane is given as -890.4 kJ/mol. This means that 890.4 kJ of heat is released when 1 mol of methane is burned. To find the heat produced when burning 0.3115 mol of methane, we can use the following equation:\n\nHeat produced (q) = moles of CH4 * ∆H per mole of CH4\n\nq = 0.3115 mol CH4 * (-890.4 kJ/mol CH4) = -277.4 kJ\n\nTherefore, 277.4 kJ of heat is produced when burning 5.00 grams of methane at a constant pressure of 1 atm."
