    "message_2": "Designing an effective and sustainable system for the treatment of industrial wastewater containing high levels of heavy metals can be achieved through a combination of chemical engineering principles and innovative technologies. Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve this goal:\n\n1. Preliminary assessment: Analyze the wastewater to determine the concentration and types of heavy metals present. This information will help in selecting the most appropriate treatment methods and designing the system.\n\n2. Selection of treatment methods: Based on the preliminary assessment, choose suitable treatment methods to remove heavy metals from the wastewater. Some common methods include chemical precipitation, ion exchange, adsorption, membrane filtration, and electrochemical techniques. These methods can be used individually or in combination, depending on the specific requirements of the wastewater.\n\n3. Design of the treatment system: Design the treatment system by integrating the selected methods into a coherent process flow. This may involve multiple stages, such as pre-treatment, primary treatment, secondary treatment, and tertiary treatment. The design should consider factors such as efficiency, cost, ease of operation, and environmental impact.\n\n4. Material selection: Choose appropriate materials for constructing the treatment system, considering factors such as corrosion resistance, durability, and cost. Stainless steel, plastic, and fiberglass are some common materials used in wastewater treatment systems.\n\n5. Energy efficiency: Optimize the treatment system's energy consumption by incorporating energy-efficient technologies and practices. This may include using energy-efficient pumps and motors, optimizing process parameters, and recovering energy from waste streams.\n\n6. Waste minimization: Design the system to minimize the generation of waste by-products, such as sludge and chemical residues. This can be achieved by optimizing the treatment process, recycling waste streams, and using environmentally friendly chemicals.\n\n7. Monitoring and control: Implement a monitoring and control system to ensure the treatment system operates efficiently and effectively. This may involve installing sensors to measure key parameters, such as pH, temperature, and heavy metal concentrations, and using automated control systems to adjust process conditions as needed.\n\n8. Maintenance and operation: Develop a maintenance and operation plan to ensure the long-term sustainability of the treatment system. This may include regular inspections, cleaning, and replacement of worn-out components.\n\n9. Environmental compliance: Ensure the treatment system complies with relevant environmental regulations and standards, such as discharge limits for heavy metals and other pollutants.\n\n10. Continuous improvement: Regularly review and update the treatment system to incorporate new technologies and best practices, ensuring its ongoing effectiveness and sustainability.\n\nBy following these steps and applying chemical engineering principles, an effective and sustainable system for treating industrial wastewater containing high levels of heavy metals can be designed and implemented."
