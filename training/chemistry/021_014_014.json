    "message_2": "The VSEPR geometry of the molecule CF4 (carbon tetrafluoride) is tetrahedral. In this molecule, the central carbon atom is bonded to four fluorine atoms, with no lone pairs on the central atom. The electron pair repulsion between the four bonding pairs of electrons results in a tetrahedral arrangement, with bond angles of approximately 109.5 degrees."
