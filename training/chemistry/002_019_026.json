    "message_2": "The boiling point of magnesium oxide (MgO) at a pressure of 1 atm cannot be determined through a simple calculation, as it depends on experimental data. However, I can provide you with the known boiling point of MgO.\n\nThe boiling point of magnesium oxide (MgO) at a pressure of 1 atm is approximately 3600 degrees Celsius (3600Â°C). This value is based on experimental data and is not derived from a specific calculation."
