    "message_1": "What is the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the following reaction at 25°C if the concentrations of CO2, H2, and CO are 0.15 M, 0.10 M, and 0.05 M respectively? \n\nCO2(g) + H2(g) ⇌ CO(g) + H2O(g)",
    "message_2": "To determine the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction, we need to know the equilibrium concentrations of all the species involved in the reaction. However, the concentration of H2O(g) is not provided. \n\nIf we assume that the reaction has reached equilibrium with the given concentrations, we can write the expression for Kc as follows:\n\nKc = [CO][H2O] / ([CO2][H2])\n\nWe need the concentration of H2O(g) to calculate Kc. If you can provide the equilibrium concentration of H2O(g), we can then determine the equilibrium constant for the reaction."
