    "message_1": "Calculate the effect of adding a catalyst on the equilibrium position of the following redox reaction: \n\nFe2+(aq) + H2O2(aq) + 2H+(aq) ⇌ Fe3+(aq) + 2H2O(l) \n\nIf a catalyst is added to the reaction mixture, what will be the new equilibrium constant (Kc)? And how will the addition of a catalyst affect the value of Kc?",
    "message_2": "Adding a catalyst to a reaction does not affect the equilibrium position or the equilibrium constant (Kc) of the reaction. A catalyst works by lowering the activation energy of the reaction, which allows the reaction to proceed at a faster rate. However, it does not change the thermodynamics of the reaction, meaning that the equilibrium constant (Kc) remains the same.\n\nIn the case of the redox reaction:\n\nFe2+(aq) + H2O2(aq) + 2H+(aq) ⇌ Fe3+(aq) + 2H2O(l)\n\nThe addition of a catalyst will speed up the rate at which the reaction reaches equilibrium, but the value of Kc and the equilibrium position will remain unchanged."
