    "message_2": "To find the density of sodium chloride (NaCl) at 25°C, we need to use the following formula:\n\nDensity = (mass of one unit cell) / (volume of one unit cell)\n\nFirst, let's find the mass of one unit cell. Sodium chloride has a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure, which means there are 4 formula units of NaCl per unit cell. The molar mass of NaCl is approximately 58.44 g/mol (22.99 g/mol for Na and 35.45 g/mol for Cl).\n\nMass of one unit cell = (4 formula units of NaCl) * (58.44 g/mol of NaCl) / (Avogadro's number)\nMass of one unit cell = (4 * 58.44 g/mol) / (6.022 x 10^23 mol^-1)\nMass of one unit cell ≈ 3.88 x 10^-22 g\n\nNext, let's find the volume of one unit cell. The lattice parameter (a) is given as 5.64 Å (1 Å = 10^-10 m).\n\nVolume of one unit cell = a^3\nVolume of one unit cell = (5.64 x 10^-10 m)^3\nVolume of one unit cell ≈ 1.79 x 10^-28 m^3\n\nNow, we can find the density:\n\nDensity = (mass of one unit cell) / (volume of one unit cell)\nDensity = (3.88 x 10^-22 g) / (1.79 x 10^-28 m^3)\nDensity ≈ 2.17 x 10^6 g/m^3\n\nThe density of sodium chloride (NaCl) at 25°C is approximately 2.17 x 10^6 g/m³."
