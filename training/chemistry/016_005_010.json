    "message_2": "To find the enthalpy of combustion of ethanol, we first need to determine the balanced chemical equation for the combustion of ethanol (C2H5OH). The combustion reaction involves ethanol reacting with oxygen (O2) to produce carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O).\n\nC2H5OH + O2 → CO2 + H2O\n\nTo balance the equation, we need to adjust the coefficients:\n\nC2H5OH + 3O2 → 2CO2 + 3H2O\n\nNow, we have the balanced chemical equation for the combustion of ethanol. Next, we need to determine the enthalpy change for the reaction.\n\nGiven that 46.0 g of ethanol is completely burned and the temperature change was recorded as -325.0 kJ, we can calculate the enthalpy change per mole of ethanol.\n\nThe molar mass of ethanol (C2H5OH) is:\n(2 × 12.01) + (6 × 1.01) + (1 × 16.00) = 46.07 g/mol\n\nSince 46.0 g of ethanol is burned, the number of moles of ethanol is:\nn = mass / molar mass = 46.0 g / 46.07 g/mol ≈ 1 mol\n\nThe enthalpy change for the reaction is -325.0 kJ. Since this is for 1 mol of ethanol, the enthalpy of combustion of ethanol is -325.0 kJ/mol.\n\nNow, we can write the balanced chemical equation with the enthalpy of combustion:\n\nC2H5OH + 3O2 → 2CO2 + 3H2O  ΔH = -325.0 kJ/mol"
