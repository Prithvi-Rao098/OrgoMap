    "message_2": "When a solution of potassium iodide (KI) is mixed with lead(II) nitrate (Pb(NO3)2), a precipitate of lead(II) iodide (PbI2) is formed. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\n2 KI(aq) + Pb(NO3)2(aq) â†’ 2 KNO3(aq) + PbI2(s)\n\nIn this reaction, the spectator ions are the potassium (K+) and nitrate (NO3-) ions, as they do not participate in the formation of the precipitate and remain in the solution."
