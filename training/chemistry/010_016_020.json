    "message_2": "To calculate the polarization potential, we need to consider the Nernst equation and the Tafel equation. The Nernst equation is used to determine the equilibrium potential of the copper electrode, while the Tafel equation is used to determine the overpotential due to the current density.\n\nFirst, let's determine the equilibrium potential of the copper electrode using the Nernst equation:\n\nE = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\n\nwhere:\nE = equilibrium potential\nE° = standard reduction potential of Cu2+/Cu (0.34 V)\nR = gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\nT = temperature (assuming 298 K)\nn = number of electrons transferred (2 for Cu2+/Cu)\nF = Faraday's constant (96485 C/mol)\nQ = reaction quotient ([Cu2+]/[Cu])\n\nSince the copper electrode is solid, its concentration is constant and can be omitted from the reaction quotient. Thus, Q = [Cu2+] = 0.1 M.\n\nE = 0.34 - (8.314 * 298 / (2 * 96485)) * ln(0.1)\nE ≈ 0.34 - 0.0296 * ln(0.1)\nE ≈ 0.34 + 0.068\nE ≈ 0.408 V\n\nNext, let's determine the overpotential using the Tafel equation:\n\nη = b * log10(j/j0)\n\nwhere:\nη = overpotential\nb = Tafel slope (assuming 0.12 V/decade for Cu2+/Cu)\nj = current density (0.5 mA/cm²)\nj0 = exchange current density (assuming 10^-6 A/cm² for Cu2+/Cu)\n\nη = 0.12 * log10(0.5 / 10^-6)\nη ≈ 0.12 * 6.3\nη ≈ 0.756 V\n\nFinally, we can calculate the polarization potential by adding the equilibrium potential and the overpotential:\n\nPolarization potential = E + η\nPolarization potential = 0.408 V + 0.756 V\nPolarization potential ≈ 1.164 V"
