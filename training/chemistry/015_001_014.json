    "message_2": "The molecular orbital diagram of carbon dioxide (CO2) can be constructed by considering the atomic orbitals of carbon and oxygen atoms. Carbon has four valence electrons in the 2s and 2p orbitals, while oxygen has six valence electrons in the 2s and 2p orbitals. In CO2, carbon is the central atom, and the molecule has a linear geometry.\n\nThe electronic structure of CO2 can be described as follows:\n\n1. The 2s orbitals of carbon and oxygen atoms form two sigma (σ) bonding orbitals and two sigma (σ*) antibonding orbitals.\n2. The 2p orbitals of carbon and oxygen atoms form four pi (π) bonding orbitals and four pi (π*) antibonding orbitals.\n\nIn total, there are 16 valence electrons in CO2. The molecular orbital diagram shows that 8 electrons fill the bonding orbitals (2 in σ, 4 in π, and 2 in σ), while the remaining 8 electrons fill the antibonding orbitals (2 in σ*, 4 in π*, and 2 in σ*).\n\nThe bonding between carbon and oxygen atoms in CO2 involves a double bond, which consists of one sigma (σ) bond formed by the overlap of sp hybridized orbitals and two pi (π) bonds formed by the overlap of 2p orbitals. This double bond is stronger and shorter than a single bond, resulting in a stable CO2 molecule.\n\nIn contrast, the bonding between oxygen atoms in CO2 does not exist, as the oxygen atoms are not directly bonded to each other. The oxygen atoms are only bonded to the central carbon atom, and there is no interaction between the oxygen atoms themselves."
