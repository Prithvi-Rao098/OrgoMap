    "message_2": "To find the energy of a gamma photon, we can use the equation:\n\nE = (hc) / λ\n\nwhere E is the energy of the photon, h is Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and λ is the wavelength of the photon.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the wavelength from nanometers (nm) to meters (m):\n\n0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10^-9 m\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the equation:\n\nE = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) x (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (0.1 x 10^-9 m)\n\nE = 1.9878 x 10^-16 J\n\nTo convert the energy from joules (J) to kiloelectronvolts (keV), we can use the conversion factor:\n\n1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J\n\nSo, 1 keV = 1 x 10^3 eV = 1.602 x 10^-16 J\n\nNow, we can convert the energy to keV:\n\nE = (1.9878 x 10^-16 J) / (1.602 x 10^-16 J/keV)\n\nE ≈ 12.4 keV\n\nThe energy of the gamma photon emitted from the nuclear decay is approximately 12.4 keV."
