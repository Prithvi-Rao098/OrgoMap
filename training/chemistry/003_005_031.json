    "message_2": "The electronic configuration of the oxygen molecule (O2) can be determined by first looking at the electronic configuration of a single oxygen atom. An oxygen atom has 8 electrons, and its electronic configuration is 1s² 2s² 2p⁴. In an oxygen molecule (O2), there are two oxygen atoms, so there are a total of 16 electrons.\n\nTo determine the molecular orbital configuration of O2, we use the molecular orbital (MO) theory, which combines the atomic orbitals of the individual oxygen atoms to form molecular orbitals. The molecular orbitals are filled with electrons in order of increasing energy.\n\nThe molecular orbital configuration for O2 is:\n\n1. σ(1s)²\n2. σ*(1s)²\n3. σ(2s)²\n4. σ*(2s)²\n5. σ(2p)²\n6. π(2p)⁴\n7. π*(2p)²\n\nIn this configuration, the σ and π orbitals represent bonding orbitals, while the σ* and π* orbitals represent antibonding orbitals. The bond order can be calculated as (number of electrons in bonding orbitals - number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2. For O2, the bond order is (10-6)/2 = 2. This means that O2 has a double bond between the two oxygen atoms.\n\nThe bond length of a molecule is influenced by the bond order and the type of bond. In general, higher bond orders result in shorter bond lengths because the atoms are held more tightly together by the stronger bond. For O2, the observed bond length is approximately 121 picometers (pm). This bond length is consistent with a double bond, which is shorter than a single bond but longer than a triple bond. The electronic configuration of O2, with a bond order of 2, helps to explain the observed bond length of the molecule."
