    "message_1": "What mass of silver chloride (AgCl) will form when 100 mL of 0.2 M silver nitrate (AgNO3) is added to 100 mL of 0.1 M sodium chloride (NaCl) solution?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of stoichiometry. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction between silver nitrate and sodium chloride is:\n\nAgNO3 (aq) + NaCl (aq) → AgCl (s) + NaNO3 (aq)\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of AgNO3 reacts with 1 mole of NaCl to produce 1 mole of AgCl.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the moles of each reactant:\n\nMoles of AgNO3 = (volume in L) × (concentration in M)\nMoles of AgNO3 = (100 mL × (1 L/1000 mL)) × 0.2 M = 0.02 moles\n\nMoles of NaCl = (volume in L) × (concentration in M)\nMoles of NaCl = (100 mL × (1 L/1000 mL)) × 0.1 M = 0.01 moles\n\nSince the ratio of AgNO3 to NaCl in the balanced equation is 1:1, the limiting reactant is NaCl, as there are fewer moles of it. Therefore, the moles of AgCl formed will be equal to the moles of the limiting reactant, NaCl.\n\nMoles of AgCl formed = 0.01 moles\n\nNow, we can calculate the mass of AgCl formed using its molar mass (Ag = 107.87 g/mol, Cl = 35.45 g/mol):\n\nMolar mass of AgCl = 107.87 g/mol + 35.45 g/mol = 143.32 g/mol\n\nMass of AgCl formed = (moles of AgCl) × (molar mass of AgCl)\nMass of AgCl formed = 0.01 moles × 143.32 g/mol = 1.4332 g\n\nTherefore, 1.4332 grams of silver chloride (AgCl) will form when 100 mL of 0.2 M silver nitrate (AgNO3) is added to 100 mL of 0.1 M sodium chloride (NaCl) solution."
