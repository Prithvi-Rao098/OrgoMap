    "message_1": "If 2.50 moles of propane react with excess oxygen gas, how much heat is released at constant pressure if the enthalpy change of the reaction is -2044 kJ/mol?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the heat released during the reaction, we can use the following formula:\n\nq = n × ΔH\n\nwhere q is the heat released, n is the number of moles of propane, and ΔH is the enthalpy change of the reaction.\n\nGiven:\nn = 2.50 moles\nΔH = -2044 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nq = (2.50 moles) × (-2044 kJ/mol)\n\nq = -5110 kJ\n\nSo, 5110 kJ of heat is released during the reaction at constant pressure."
