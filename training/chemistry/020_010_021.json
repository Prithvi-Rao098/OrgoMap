    "message_1": "Consider a chemical reaction in which X and Y combine to form XY at equilibrium: \nX + Y ⇌ XY \nThe equilibrium constant for the reaction is Kc = 1.2x10^-4. Initially, [X] = 0.2 M and [Y] is unknown. If 0.1 M of Y is added to the reaction mixture, what will be the new equilibrium concentration of XY?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the equilibrium constant expression and an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table. \n\nThe equilibrium constant expression for the given reaction is:\n\nKc = [XY] / ([X] * [Y])\n\nGiven Kc = 1.2 x 10^(-4), [X] = 0.2 M initially, and 0.1 M of Y is added. Let's assume the initial concentration of Y is y M. Then, the initial concentration of XY is 0 M.\n\nNow, we can set up the ICE table:\n\n          X      +      Y     ⇌     XY\nInitial: 0.2 M          y M             0 M\nChange:  -x M         -x M           +x M\nEquilibrium: (0.2-x) M (y-x) M       x M\n\nSince 0.1 M of Y is added, the new equilibrium concentration of Y will be (y + 0.1 - x) M.\n\nNow, we can plug these equilibrium concentrations into the equilibrium constant expression:\n\n1.2 x 10^(-4) = x / ((0.2 - x) * (y + 0.1 - x))\n\nWe need to find the value of x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of XY. However, we have two unknowns (x and y) in the equation. To solve for x, we need to make an assumption.\n\nSince Kc is very small (1.2 x 10^(-4)), we can assume that the reaction does not proceed significantly to the right. Therefore, x will be very small compared to 0.2 and y. With this assumption, we can simplify the equation:\n\n1.2 x 10^(-4) ≈ x / ((0.2) * (y + 0.1))\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx ≈ 1.2 x 10^(-4) * (0.2) * (y + 0.1)\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot find the exact value of x without knowing the initial concentration of Y (y M). However, we now have an equation that relates x to y. If the initial concentration of Y is known, we can use this equation to find the new equilibrium concentration of XY."
