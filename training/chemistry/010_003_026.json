    "message_2": "To calculate the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for the electrochemical reaction, we first need to determine the overall cell potential (E°cell) for the redox reaction. The cell potential is the difference between the reduction potentials of the two half-reactions.\n\nIn this case, the Cu2+ half-reaction is the reduction half-reaction, and the Fe2+ half-reaction needs to be reversed to become an oxidation half-reaction:\n\nCu2+ (aq) + 2e- → Cu (s)  E° = +0.34 V (reduction)\nFe (s) → Fe2+ (aq) + 2e-  E° = +0.44 V (oxidation, reversed sign)\n\nNow, we can calculate the overall cell potential (E°cell):\n\nE°cell = E°(reduction) + E°(oxidation)\nE°cell = (+0.34 V) + (+0.44 V)\nE°cell = +0.78 V\n\nNext, we can use the Nernst equation to calculate the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG):\n\nΔG = -nFE°cell\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of electrons transferred (in this case, n = 2), F is Faraday's constant (96,485 C/mol), and E°cell is the overall cell potential.\n\nΔG = -(2 mol)(96,485 C/mol)(0.78 V)\nΔG = -150,356.2 J/mol\n\nThe change in Gibbs free energy for the electrochemical reaction is -150,356.2 J/mol."
