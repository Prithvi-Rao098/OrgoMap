    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the oxidation of 25 grams of iron to form iron(III) oxide, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction.\n2. Determine the moles of iron and iron(III) oxide involved in the reaction.\n3. Use the enthalpy of formation values to calculate the enthalpy change.\n\nStep 1: Balanced chemical equation\nThe balanced chemical equation for the oxidation of iron to form iron(III) oxide is:\n\n4 Fe(s) + 3 O2(g) → 2 Fe2O3(s)\n\nStep 2: Determine the moles of iron and iron(III) oxide\nFirst, we need to determine the moles of iron (Fe) in 25 grams. The molar mass of iron is 55.85 g/mol.\n\nmoles of Fe = mass of Fe / molar mass of Fe\nmoles of Fe = 25 g / 55.85 g/mol\nmoles of Fe = 0.4476 mol\n\nFrom the balanced chemical equation, we can see that 4 moles of Fe produce 2 moles of Fe2O3. Therefore, we can determine the moles of Fe2O3 produced by the reaction:\n\nmoles of Fe2O3 = (moles of Fe / 4) × 2\nmoles of Fe2O3 = (0.4476 mol / 4) × 2\nmoles of Fe2O3 = 0.2238 mol\n\nStep 3: Calculate the enthalpy change\nNow, we can use the enthalpy of formation values for Fe(s) and Fe2O3(s) to calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction. The enthalpy of formation for Fe(s) is 0 kJ/mol, and for Fe2O3(s) is -824.2 kJ/mol.\n\nΔH = [moles of products × enthalpy of formation of products] - [moles of reactants × enthalpy of formation of reactants]\nΔH = [(0.2238 mol × -824.2 kJ/mol) - (0.4476 mol × 0 kJ/mol)]\nΔH = -184.3 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change for the oxidation of 25 grams of iron to form iron(III) oxide is -184.3 kJ. The negative sign indicates that the reaction is exothermic, meaning it releases heat."
