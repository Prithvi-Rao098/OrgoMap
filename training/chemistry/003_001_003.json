If the initial concentrations of A and B are both 1.0 M, what will be the equilibrium concentration of each gas at 298 K? The equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction at 298 K is 2.75 x 10^-2.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the equilibrium constant expression and an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table.\n\nThe balanced equation for the reaction is:\n\nA(g) + B(g) ↔ C(g)\n\nThe equilibrium constant expression for this reaction is:\n\nKc = [C] / ([A] * [B])\n\nGiven that Kc = 2.75 x 10^-2 at 298 K, we can set up the ICE table:\n\nInitial concentrations:\n[A] = 1.0 M\n[B] = 1.0 M\n[C] = 0 M\n\nChange in concentrations:\n[A] = -x\n[B] = -x\n[C] = +x\n\nEquilibrium concentrations:\n[A] = 1.0 - x\n[B] = 1.0 - x\n[C] = x\n\nNow, we can plug the equilibrium concentrations into the equilibrium constant expression:\n\n2.75 x 10^-2 = x / ((1.0 - x) * (1.0 - x))\n\nTo solve for x, we can first simplify the denominator:\n\n2.75 x 10^-2 = x / (1 - 2x + x^2)\n\nNow, multiply both sides by the denominator to get rid of the fraction:\n\nx = 2.75 x 10^-2 * (1 - 2x + x^2)\n\nSince Kc is small, we can assume that x is also small. Therefore, we can approximate 1 - 2x ≈ 1:\n\nx ≈ 2.75 x 10^-2 * (1 - 0 + 0)\nx ≈ 2.75 x 10^-2\n\nNow, we can find the equilibrium concentrations of each gas:\n\n[A] = 1.0 - x ≈ 1.0 - 2.75 x 10^-2 ≈ 0.975 M\n[B] = 1.0 - x ≈ 1.0 - 2.75 x 10^-2 ≈ 0.975 M\n[C] = x ≈ 2.75 x 10^-2 M\n\nSo, the equilibrium concentrations of A, B, and C at 298 K are approximately 0.975 M, 0.975 M, and 2.75 x 10^-2 M, respectively."
