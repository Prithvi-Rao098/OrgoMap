    "message_2": "To find the rate constant (k) for the reaction, we need to use the rate law equation:\n\nrate = k[NO]^x[H2]^y\n\nwhere rate is the rate of disappearance of NO, [NO] and [H2] are the concentrations of NO and H2, and x and y are the reaction orders with respect to NO and H2.\n\nSince the balanced equation is 2NO + 2H2 → N2 + 2H2O, we can assume that the reaction is second order with respect to NO and first order with respect to H2. This is because the stoichiometric coefficients of NO and H2 are 2 and 2, respectively. Therefore, the rate law equation becomes:\n\nrate = k[NO]^2[H2]\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\n1.20x10^-3 mol/L/s = k(0.040 mol/L)^2(0.020 mol/L)\n\n1.20x10^-3 mol/L/s = k(0.0016 mol²/L²)(0.020 mol/L)\n\nTo solve for k, divide both sides by (0.0016 mol²/L²)(0.020 mol/L):\n\nk = (1.20x10^-3 mol/L/s) / (0.0016 mol²/L²)(0.020 mol/L)\n\nk ≈ 37.5 L²/mol²/s\n\nSo, the rate constant for the reaction at 500 K is approximately 37.5 L²/mol²/s."
