    "message_2": "When a neutron is captured by Carbon-14, it becomes Carbon-15. Carbon-15 is an unstable isotope that undergoes beta decay. In beta decay, a neutron is converted into a proton, and an electron (beta particle) is emitted. \n\nSo, when Carbon-15 undergoes beta decay, it will have one more proton and one less neutron, resulting in the formation of the daughter nuclide Nitrogen-15 (15N)."
