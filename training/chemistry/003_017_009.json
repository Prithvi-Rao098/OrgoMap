    "message_2": "The design of building blocks plays a crucial role in the self-assembly of supramolecular structures and their properties. The building blocks are the fundamental units that interact with each other through non-covalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, π-π stacking, and electrostatic interactions. These interactions guide the self-assembly process and determine the final structure and properties of the supramolecular system. Several factors contribute to the effectiveness of building blocks in directing the self-assembly process, including shape, size, functionality, and flexibility.\n\nExamples of successful designs from literature:\n\n1. Cucurbiturils: Cucurbiturils are a family of macrocyclic molecules that have been extensively studied for their ability to form host-guest complexes with various guest molecules. The rigid, barrel-shaped structure of cucurbiturils, along with the presence of multiple hydrogen bond donor and acceptor sites, allows for the selective binding of guest molecules, leading to the formation of well-defined supramolecular structures. For example, cucurbit[7]uril has been used to construct a supramolecular polymer by incorporating bis-ammonium guest molecules (Appel et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2012, 134, 8082–8085).\n\n2. DNA-based building blocks: DNA has emerged as a powerful building block for the design of supramolecular structures due to its highly specific base-pairing interactions. The programmability of DNA sequences allows for the precise control over the self-assembly process, leading to the formation of complex structures such as DNA origami, DNA nanotubes, and DNA-based hydrogels (Rothemund, Nature, 2006, 440, 297–302; Seeman, Nature, 2003, 421, 427–431).\n\n3. Peptide-based building blocks: Peptides are versatile building blocks for the construction of supramolecular structures due to their diverse functionality and conformational flexibility. β-sheet-forming peptides, for example, can self-assemble into well-defined nanostructures such as fibers, hydrogels, and nanotubes. The self-assembly process can be controlled by modulating the peptide sequence, concentration, and environmental conditions (Zhang et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1993, 115, 11010–11012).\n\nFactors contributing to the effectiveness of building blocks in directing the self-assembly process:\n\n1. Shape: The shape of the building blocks plays a significant role in determining the type of supramolecular structures formed. For example, the formation of helical structures is favored by building blocks with a chiral, propeller-like shape, while planar building blocks tend to form layered structures.\n\n2. Size: The size of the building blocks can influence the stability and properties of the resulting supramolecular structures. For instance, larger building blocks may lead to the formation of more stable structures due to increased van der Waals interactions, while smaller building blocks may result in more dynamic structures with faster exchange rates.\n\n3. Functionality: The presence of functional groups on the building blocks can greatly affect the self-assembly process by providing specific interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, or metal coordination. These interactions can be used to control the directionality and selectivity of the self-assembly process.\n\n4. Flexibility: The flexibility of the building blocks can impact the self-assembly process by allowing for conformational changes that enable the formation of specific supramolecular structures. For example, flexible building blocks can adopt multiple conformations, leading to the formation of polymorphic structures, while rigid building blocks may only form a single, well-defined structure.\n\nIn summary, the design of building blocks is crucial for the self-assembly of supramolecular structures and their properties. Factors such as shape, size, functionality, and flexibility play important roles in directing the self-assembly process. Successful designs from literature, such as cucurbiturils, DNA-based building blocks, and peptide-based building blocks, demonstrate the potential of these factors in controlling the formation of complex supramolecular structures with diverse properties."
