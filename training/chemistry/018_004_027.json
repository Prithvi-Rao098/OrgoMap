    "message_2": "To find the activation energy (Ea) for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, we can use the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk = Ae^(-Ea/RT)\n\nwhere k is the reaction rate, A is the frequency factor, Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nWe have two sets of data:\n\n1) Reaction rate at 300 K = 0.013 M/s\n2) Reaction rate at 310 K = 0.022 M/s\n\nWe can set up two equations using the Arrhenius equation:\n\n1) 0.013 = (1.2 x 10^9) * e^(-Ea / (8.314 * 300))\n2) 0.022 = (1.2 x 10^9) * e^(-Ea / (8.314 * 310))\n\nNow, we can divide equation 2 by equation 1 to eliminate the frequency factor (A) and solve for Ea:\n\n(0.022 / 0.013) = e^((Ea / (8.314 * 300)) - (Ea / (8.314 * 310)))\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(0.022 / 0.013) = (Ea / (8.314 * 300)) - (Ea / (8.314 * 310))\n\nNow, we can solve for Ea:\n\nEa = 8.314 * (300 * 310) * ln(0.022 / 0.013) / (310 - 300)\n\nEa ≈ 8.314 * 3000 * 0.5232 / 10\n\nEa ≈ 13018.312 J/mol\n\nThe activation energy for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide is approximately 13,018 J/mol."
