    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of 1 mole of methane gas (CH4), we need to consider the balanced chemical equation for the combustion reaction:\n\nCH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l)\n\nNow, we can use Hess's Law to calculate the enthalpy change for this reaction. Hess's Law states that the enthalpy change for a reaction is equal to the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of the products minus the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of the reactants.\n\nΔH_combustion = [ΔH_f(CO2) + 2 * ΔH_f(H2O)] - [ΔH_f(CH4) + 2 * ΔH_f(O2)]\n\nSince the standard enthalpy of formation of an element in its standard state is zero, the standard enthalpy of formation of O2 is 0 kJ/mol.\n\nΔH_combustion = [(-393.51 kJ/mol) + 2 * (-285.83 kJ/mol)] - [(-74.87 kJ/mol) + 2 * (0 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH_combustion = (-393.51 + 2 * -285.83 + 74.87) kJ/mol\n\nΔH_combustion = (-393.51 - 571.66 + 74.87) kJ/mol\n\nΔH_combustion = -890.3 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy change for the combustion of 1 mole of methane gas (CH4) at standard conditions is -890.3 kJ/mol."
