    "message_2": "As a language model AI, I cannot analyze actual magnetic resonance spectra data. However, I can guide you through the process of determining the molecular structure of a sample based on magnetic resonance spectra.\n\nTo determine the molecular structure of a sample using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), you would typically follow these steps:\n\n1. Obtain the spectra: Record the magnetic resonance spectra at different temperatures and magnetic fields. This can be done using techniques like Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy or Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy.\n\n2. Analyze the spectra: Examine the spectra for characteristic peaks, which represent the resonance frequencies of the nuclei or electrons in the sample. The position, intensity, and shape of these peaks can provide valuable information about the molecular structure.\n\n3. Assign the peaks: Assign the observed peaks to specific nuclei or electrons within the molecule. This can be done by comparing the experimental spectra with reference data or by using computational methods to predict the expected spectra for different molecular structures.\n\n4. Determine the connectivity: Use the coupling constants (the splitting patterns of the peaks) to determine the connectivity between the nuclei or electrons. This can help you establish the bonding patterns within the molecule.\n\n5. Determine the spatial arrangement: Use the chemical shift values (the positions of the peaks) and other parameters like nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) to determine the spatial arrangement of the atoms within the molecule.\n\n6. Refine the structure: Refine the proposed molecular structure by comparing the experimental spectra with the predicted spectra for the proposed structure. This can be done using computational methods like density functional theory (DFT) or molecular mechanics calculations.\n\n7. Validate the structure: Validate the proposed molecular structure by comparing it with other experimental data, such as crystallographic data, mass spectrometry data, or infrared spectroscopy data.\n\nBy following these steps and carefully analyzing the magnetic resonance spectra, you should be able to determine the molecular structure of the sample under investigation."
