    "message_2": "To calculate the bond order of the carbon monoxide (CO) molecule, we need to consider its molecular orbital diagram. In the molecular orbital theory, bond order is defined as the difference between the number of bonding electrons and the number of antibonding electrons, divided by 2.\n\nCarbon has 6 electrons, and oxygen has 8 electrons. In CO, the 14 electrons are distributed in the molecular orbitals as follows:\n\n1. σ(1s) - 2 electrons (bonding)\n2. σ*(1s) - 2 electrons (antibonding)\n3. σ(2s) - 2 electrons (bonding)\n4. σ*(2s) - 2 electrons (antibonding)\n5. σ(2pz) - 2 electrons (bonding)\n6. π(2px) and π(2py) - 4 electrons (bonding)\n7. π*(2px) and π*(2py) - 0 electrons (antibonding)\n\nBond order = (Number of bonding electrons - Number of antibonding electrons) / 2\nBond order = (10 - 4) / 2\nBond order = 6 / 2\nBond order = 3\n\nThe bond order of the carbon monoxide (CO) molecule is 3, which means there is a triple bond between the carbon and oxygen atoms.\n\nNow, let's calculate the bond length. The bond length of a molecule is inversely proportional to the bond order. As the bond order increases, the bond length decreases. The experimental bond length of CO is 1.128 Å (angstroms).\n\nThe type of bond formed between carbon and oxygen in CO is a covalent bond, specifically a polar covalent bond. This is because the electronegativity difference between carbon (2.55) and oxygen (3.44) is 0.89, which falls in the range of 0.5 to 1.7 for polar covalent bonds. The oxygen atom is more electronegative, so it attracts the shared electrons more strongly, creating a partial negative charge on the oxygen and a partial positive charge on the carbon."
