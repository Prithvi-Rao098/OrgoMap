    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will analyze the given information from the proton NMR spectrum and deduce the molecular structure and chemical formula of the unknown organic compound.\n\n1. Single peak at 7.2 ppm: This peak corresponds to the chemical shift of aromatic or vinylic protons. Since there is only one peak, it indicates that there is only one type of such proton in the compound. Let's assume there is one aromatic proton.\n\n2. Triplet at 1.2 ppm: This peak corresponds to the chemical shift of an alkyl group, specifically a methyl group (CH3). The triplet splitting pattern indicates that this methyl group is adjacent to a carbon with two hydrogens (CH2). \n\n3. Quartet at 2.1 ppm: This peak corresponds to the chemical shift of an alkyl group, specifically a methylene group (CH2). The quartet splitting pattern indicates that this methylene group is adjacent to a carbon with three hydrogens (CH3).\n\nBased on the given information, we can deduce the following partial structure:\n\n-CH2-CH3\n\nNow, we need to connect the aromatic proton to this structure. Since there are no heteroatoms or exchangeable protons, the aromatic proton must be directly connected to the methylene group:\n\nAr-H\n  |\n-CH2-CH3\n\nThe Ar represents the aromatic ring. The simplest aromatic ring is a benzene ring, so the molecular structure of the unknown compound is:\n\n  H\n  |\n-C6H5-CH2-CH3\n\nThe chemical formula for this compound is C8H10. The compound is ethylbenzene."
