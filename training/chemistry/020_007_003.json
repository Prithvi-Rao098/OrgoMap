    "message_2": "Increasing the pressure in the reaction N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g) will affect the equilibrium position according to Le Chatelier's principle. This principle states that if a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in pressure, temperature, or concentration of reactants or products, the system will adjust its equilibrium position to counteract the change.\n\nIn this reaction, there are 4 moles of gas on the reactant side (1 mole of N2 and 3 moles of H2) and 2 moles of gas on the product side (2 moles of NH3). When the pressure is increased, the system will try to counteract the change by shifting the equilibrium position to the side with fewer moles of gas to reduce the pressure. In this case, the equilibrium will shift to the right, towards the formation of NH3.\n\nAs a result, increasing the pressure in this reaction will favor the formation of ammonia (NH3) and the equilibrium position will shift to the right."
