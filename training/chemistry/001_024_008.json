    "message_2": "To identify the unknown organic compound, we need to analyze the given data from infrared (IR) spectroscopy and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy. Unfortunately, you haven't provided the actual data. However, I can guide you through the process of interpreting the data to identify the compound.\n\n1. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:\nInfrared spectroscopy provides information about the functional groups present in the compound. Look for the following key peaks in the IR spectrum:\n\n- O-H stretch: Broad peak around 3200-3600 cm-1 (indicating alcohol or carboxylic acid)\n- N-H stretch: Sharp peak around 3300 cm-1 (indicating amine or amide)\n- C=O stretch: Sharp peak around 1700 cm-1 (indicating ketone, aldehyde, carboxylic acid, or ester)\n- C=C stretch: Peak around 1600-1680 cm-1 (indicating alkene)\n- C-O stretch: Peak around 1000-1300 cm-1 (indicating ether, ester, or alcohol)\n\n2. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR) Spectroscopy:\n1H NMR spectroscopy provides information about the hydrogen atoms in the compound, including their chemical environment and how many hydrogen atoms are in each environment. Analyze the following aspects of the 1H NMR spectrum:\n\n- Chemical shift (ppm): Indicates the type of hydrogen environment (e.g., alkyl, alkenyl, aromatic, alcohol, etc.)\n- Splitting pattern: Indicates the number of neighboring hydrogen atoms (n) using the n+1 rule (e.g., singlet, doublet, triplet, etc.)\n- Integration: Indicates the relative number of hydrogen atoms in each environment\n\nBased on the molecular formula (C10H12O), we can deduce that the compound has a degree of unsaturation of 5 (using the formula: (2C + 2 + N - H - X)/2, where C is the number of carbons, N is the number of nitrogens, H is the number of hydrogens, and X is the number of halogens). This degree of unsaturation suggests that the compound may contain a combination of double bonds, triple bonds, and/or rings.\n\nUsing the information from both the IR and 1H NMR spectra, you can piece together the structure of the unknown compound. Look for functional groups in the IR spectrum and then use the 1H NMR data to determine the arrangement of hydrogen atoms and carbon environments. Once you have a proposed structure, double-check that it matches the molecular formula and all the spectroscopic data."
