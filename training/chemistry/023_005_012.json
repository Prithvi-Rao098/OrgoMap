    "message_2": "The synthesis of ibuprofen from 2-methylpropylbenzene (isobutylbenzene) and carbon dioxide involves several steps, including Friedel-Crafts alkylation, hydrolysis, and carboxylation. Here is the detailed mechanism:\n\n1. Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:\nIn the first step, 2-methylpropylbenzene (isobutylbenzene) undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation with propionyl chloride in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, such as aluminum chloride (AlCl3). The catalyst activates the carbonyl group of propionyl chloride, making it more electrophilic. The benzene ring then attacks the carbonyl carbon, forming a new carbon-carbon bond and generating a cationic intermediate. The intermediate loses a proton to regenerate the aromaticity of the benzene ring, resulting in the formation of 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanoyl chloride.\n\n2. Hydrolysis:\nThe 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanoyl chloride is then hydrolyzed in the presence of water and a base, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH), to form 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionic acid. The base deprotonates the water molecule, making it a better nucleophile. The hydroxide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate. The chloride ion then leaves, and the carbonyl group is reformed, resulting in the formation of the carboxylic acid.\n\n3. Carboxylation:\nIn the final step, 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionic acid is treated with carbon dioxide (CO2) and a base, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH), to form ibuprofen. The base deprotonates the carboxylic acid, generating a carboxylate ion. The carboxylate ion then reacts with CO2, forming a new carbon-carbon bond and generating a bicarbonate intermediate. The intermediate is then protonated by water, yielding ibuprofen.\n\nIn summary, the synthesis of ibuprofen from 2-methylpropylbenzene and carbon dioxide involves Friedel-Crafts alkylation, hydrolysis, and carboxylation steps. The reagents and intermediates play crucial roles in activating electrophiles, facilitating nucleophilic attacks, and generating the desired product."
