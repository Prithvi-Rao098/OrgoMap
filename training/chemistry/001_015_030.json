    "message_2": "Ibuprofen is a widely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with the chemical formula C13H18O2. Its IUPAC name is 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanoic acid. Retrosynthetic analysis is a technique used to break down complex molecules into simpler precursors, which can then be synthesized to obtain the target molecule.\n\nRetrosynthetic analysis of ibuprofen:\n\nIbuprofen can be synthesized through several routes, but one of the most common methods involves the following key steps:\n\n1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation\n2. Reduction of the carbonyl group\n3. Carboxylation\n\nStarting materials and reaction steps:\n\n1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation:\nStarting materials: p-isobutylbenzene (also known as cumene) and propionyl chloride\nCatalyst: Aluminum chloride (AlCl3) or another Lewis acid\nReaction: p-isobutylbenzene reacts with propionyl chloride in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst to form 4-isobutylacetophenone.\n\n2. Reduction of the carbonyl group:\nStarting material: 4-isobutylacetophenone\nReducing agent: Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) or another suitable reducing agent\nReaction: 4-isobutylacetophenone is reduced to form 4-isobutyl-1-phenylpropan-1-ol.\n\n3. Carboxylation:\nStarting material: 4-isobutyl-1-phenylpropan-1-ol\nReagents: Carbon dioxide (CO2) and a strong base such as potassium hydroxide (KOH) or sodium hydroxide (NaOH)\nReaction: 4-isobutyl-1-phenylpropan-1-ol is treated with CO2 and a strong base to form the final product, ibuprofen.\n\nIn summary, the retrosynthetic analysis of ibuprofen involves breaking it down into simpler precursors, such as p-isobutylbenzene and propionyl chloride. The synthesis of ibuprofen can then be achieved through a series of reactions, including Friedel-Crafts alkylation, reduction of the carbonyl group, and carboxylation."
