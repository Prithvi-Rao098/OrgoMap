    "message_2": "To calculate the bond length between carbon and oxygen atoms in carbon monoxide (CO), we can use Hooke's Law and the concept of reduced mass. Hooke's Law states that the force acting on a spring is proportional to the displacement from its equilibrium position:\n\nF = -k * x\n\nwhere F is the force, k is the force constant, and x is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n\nThe reduced mass (μ) of a diatomic molecule can be calculated using the formula:\n\nμ = (m1 * m2) / (m1 + m2)\n\nwhere m1 and m2 are the masses of the two atoms in the molecule. For carbon monoxide, m1 is the mass of carbon (C) and m2 is the mass of oxygen (O). The atomic masses of carbon and oxygen are approximately 12 amu and 16 amu, respectively. To convert these atomic masses to kilograms, we can use the conversion factor 1 amu = 1.66054 × 10^-27 kg:\n\nm1 = 12 amu * (1.66054 × 10^-27 kg/amu) = 1.99265 × 10^-26 kg\nm2 = 16 amu * (1.66054 × 10^-27 kg/amu) = 2.65672 × 10^-26 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the reduced mass:\n\nμ = (1.99265 × 10^-26 kg * 2.65672 × 10^-26 kg) / (1.99265 × 10^-26 kg + 2.65672 × 10^-26 kg)\nμ = 5.297 × 10^-53 kg^2 / 4.649 × 10^-26 kg\nμ = 1.139 × 10^-27 kg\n\nNext, we can use the force constant (k) and the reduced mass (μ) to calculate the vibrational frequency (ν) of the molecule using the formula:\n\nν = (1 / 2π) * √(k / μ)\n\nwhere k is the force constant (1070 N/m) and μ is the reduced mass (1.139 × 10^-27 kg):\n\nν = (1 / 2π) * √(1070 N/m / 1.139 × 10^-27 kg)\nν = (1 / 2π) * √(9.396 × 10^26 s^-2)\nν = 4.864 × 10^13 Hz\n\nFinally, we can use the vibrational frequency (ν) to calculate the bond length (r) using the formula:\n\nr = c / (2 * ν)\n\nwhere c is the speed of light (2.998 × 10^8 m/s) and ν is the vibrational frequency:\n\nr = (2.998 × 10^8 m/s) / (2 * 4.864 × 10^13 Hz)\nr = 3.083 × 10^-11 m\n\nSo, the bond length between the carbon and oxygen atoms in carbon monoxide (CO) is approximately 3.083 × 10^-11 meters or 1.13 Å (angstroms)."
