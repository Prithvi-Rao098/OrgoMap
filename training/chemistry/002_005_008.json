    "message_2": "The inorganic compound formed between magnesium and chlorine is an ionic compound. This is because magnesium is a metal (from Group 2 in the periodic table) and chlorine is a non-metal (from Group 17 in the periodic table). \n\nIn an ionic compound, there is a transfer of electrons from the metal to the non-metal, resulting in the formation of positive and negative ions. In this case, magnesium loses two electrons to form a Mg2+ ion, and chlorine gains one electron to form a Cl- ion. Since there are two chlorine atoms needed to balance the charges, the compound formed is MgCl2 (magnesium chloride).\n\nThe formation of an ionic compound between magnesium and chlorine can be justified by their difference in electronegativity. Magnesium has an electronegativity of 1.31, while chlorine has an electronegativity of 3.16. The difference in electronegativity between the two elements is 1.85, which is greater than 1.7, the threshold for considering a bond to be ionic. This indicates that the bond between magnesium and chlorine is predominantly ionic in nature."
