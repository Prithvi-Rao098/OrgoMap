    "message_2": "The coordination number of the complex formed between Ni2+ and ethylenediamine (en) is 6. Ethylenediamine is a bidentate ligand, meaning it can form two coordinate bonds with the central metal ion. In the case of Ni2+, three ethylenediamine molecules can bind to the metal ion, resulting in a total of six coordinate bonds.\n\nThe structure of the complex is [Ni(en)3]2+. Since the coordination number is 6, the complex is likely to be octahedral in geometry."
