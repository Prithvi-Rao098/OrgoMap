The balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane is CH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(l), and the standard enthalpy of formation ΔH°f for methane, carbon dioxide, and water are -74.8 kJ/mol, -393.5 kJ/mol, and -285.8 kJ/mol, respectively.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the complete combustion of 2 moles of methane gas, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH°rxn = Σ ΔH°f(products) - Σ ΔH°f(reactants)\n\nFor the given balanced chemical equation, CH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(l), we have:\n\nΔH°rxn = [1 * ΔH°f(CO2) + 2 * ΔH°f(H2O)] - [2 * ΔH°f(CH4) + 2 * ΔH°f(O2)]\n\nSince the standard enthalpy of formation for elemental oxygen (O2) is zero, the equation becomes:\n\nΔH°rxn = [1 * (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 * (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [2 * (-74.8 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH°rxn = (-393.5 kJ/mol - 571.6 kJ/mol) - (-149.6 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH°rxn = -965.1 kJ/mol + 149.6 kJ/mol\n\nΔH°rxn = -815.5 kJ/mol\n\nSince we are calculating the standard enthalpy change for the complete combustion of 2 moles of methane gas, we need to multiply the enthalpy change for 1 mole by 2:\n\nΔH°rxn (2 moles) = -815.5 kJ/mol * 2\n\nΔH°rxn (2 moles) = -1631 kJ\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the complete combustion of 2 moles of methane gas under standard conditions is -1631 kJ."
