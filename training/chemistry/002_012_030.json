    "message_2": "To calculate the bond order and bond length of the N-O bond in the nitrite ion (NO2-), we need to consider the resonance structures of the ion.\n\nResonance structures of NO2-:\n\nStructure 1: O-N=O\nStructure 2: O=N-O\n\nIn both structures, there is one single bond and one double bond between the nitrogen and oxygen atoms. The bond order is the average of the bonds in these two structures.\n\nBond order = (1 + 2) / 2 = 1.5\n\nNow, let's find the bond length. The bond length of a molecule is inversely proportional to the bond order. The typical bond lengths for N=O and N-O are 1.21 Å and 1.41 Å, respectively.\n\nTo find the average bond length, we can use the following formula:\n\nAverage bond length = (1.21 Å + 1.41 Å) / 2 = 1.31 Å\n\nSo, the bond order of the N-O bond in the nitrite ion (NO2-) is 1.5, and the bond length is 1.31 Å."
