    "message_2": "In the coordination complex [UO2(NO3)2(H2O)2], we can determine the oxidation state of uranium by analyzing the oxidation states of the other elements in the complex.\n\n1. The oxidation state of oxygen is typically -2.\n2. The oxidation state of hydrogen is +1.\n3. The oxidation state of nitrogen in the nitrate ion (NO3-) is +5.\n\nNow, let's break down the complex into its components:\n\n- UO2: The total oxidation state of the two oxygen atoms is -4 (2 * -2). Therefore, the oxidation state of uranium (U) in UO2 must be +6 to balance the charges.\n\n- NO3: The oxidation state of nitrogen is +5, and there are three oxygen atoms with an oxidation state of -2 each, resulting in a total oxidation state of -6 for the oxygen atoms. This means that the nitrate ion (NO3-) has a charge of -1. Since there are two nitrate ions in the complex, the total charge from the nitrate ions is -2.\n\n- H2O: The oxidation state of hydrogen is +1, and there are two hydrogen atoms in each water molecule, resulting in a total oxidation state of +2 for the hydrogen atoms. The oxygen atom has an oxidation state of -2. Since there are two water molecules in the complex, the total charge from the water molecules is 0.\n\nConsidering the charges from all components, the overall charge of the complex is neutral. Therefore, the oxidation state of uranium in the coordination complex [UO2(NO3)2(H2O)2] is +6.\n\nNow, let's determine the number of oxygen atoms involved in the coordination around uranium:\n\n- 2 oxygen atoms come from the UO2 group.\n- 4 oxygen atoms come from the two nitrate ions (2 * 2).\n- 2 oxygen atoms come from the two water molecules (2 * 1).\n\nIn total, there are 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 oxygen atoms involved in the coordination around uranium in the complex [UO2(NO3)2(H2O)2]."
