    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium concentration of NO2, we can use the balanced chemical equation and the given initial and equilibrium concentrations.\n\nInitial concentrations:\n[NO2] = 0.25 mol/L\n[N2O4] = 0 (since it is not mentioned)\n\nAt equilibrium:\n[N2O4] = 0.10 mol/L\n\nLet x be the change in concentration of NO2 at equilibrium. Since 2 moles of NO2 react to form 1 mole of N2O4, the change in concentration of NO2 will be 2x, and the change in concentration of N2O4 will be x.\n\nAt equilibrium:\n[NO2] = 0.25 - 2x\n[N2O4] = 0.10\n\nNow, we can write the expression for the equilibrium constant Kc:\n\nKc = [N2O4] / [NO2]^2\n\nWe are not given the value of Kc, but we can still solve for x using the equilibrium concentrations:\n\n0.10 = (0.25 - 2x)^2\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 0.05\n\nNow, we can find the equilibrium concentration of NO2:\n\n[NO2] = 0.25 - 2x = 0.25 - 2(0.05) = 0.25 - 0.10 = 0.15 mol/L\n\nSo, the equilibrium concentration of NO2 is 0.15 mol/L."
