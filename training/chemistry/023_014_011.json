    "message_2": "To determine the maximum yield of 4-bromoacetanilide, we first need to find the limiting reagent in the reaction. The reaction is as follows:\n\nAcetanilide + Br2 â†’ 4-bromoacetanilide + HBr\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the moles of each reactant:\n\n1. Acetanilide: The molecular weight of acetanilide (C8H9NO) is 135.17 g/mol.\n5 g of acetanilide / 135.17 g/mol = 0.0370 mol of acetanilide\n\n2. Bromine: Since there is a 25% excess of bromine, we need to calculate the moles of bromine required for the reaction and then add the excess.\nThe molecular weight of bromine (Br2) is 159.81 g/mol.\n0.0370 mol of acetanilide * 1 mol of Br2 / 1 mol of acetanilide = 0.0370 mol of Br2 (required for the reaction)\n25% excess of bromine: 0.0370 mol * 1.25 = 0.0462 mol of Br2 (total)\n\nSince acetanilide is present in a lesser amount, it is the limiting reagent.\n\nNow, we can calculate the theoretical yield of 4-bromoacetanilide:\n\nThe molecular weight of 4-bromoacetanilide (C8H8BrNO) is 214.06 g/mol.\n0.0370 mol of acetanilide * 1 mol of 4-bromoacetanilide / 1 mol of acetanilide = 0.0370 mol of 4-bromoacetanilide\n0.0370 mol of 4-bromoacetanilide * 214.06 g/mol = 7.92 g\n\nThe theoretical yield of 4-bromoacetanilide is 7.92 g.\n\nThe maximum yield of 4-bromoacetanilide that can be obtained from 5 grams of acetanilide and a 25% excess of bromine is 7.92 g."
