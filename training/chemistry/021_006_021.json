    "message_2": "The dipole moment of a molecule is a measure of its polarity, which is the separation of charge within the molecule. It is calculated using the formula:\n\nDipole moment (μ) = Charge (Q) × Distance (d)\n\nFor ammonia (NH3), the molecule has a trigonal pyramidal shape with the nitrogen atom at the apex and the three hydrogen atoms surrounding it. The nitrogen atom is more electronegative than the hydrogen atoms, which leads to a separation of charge within the molecule.\n\nThe bond dipole moment for each N-H bond can be calculated using the bond length (d) and the partial charges on the nitrogen and hydrogen atoms. The bond length for N-H in ammonia is approximately 1.012 Å (1.012 × 10^(-10) m). The partial charges on nitrogen and hydrogen are approximately -0.82e and +0.27e, respectively, where e is the elementary charge (1.6 × 10^(-19) C).\n\nBond dipole moment (μ_NH) = Charge (Q) × Distance (d)\nμ_NH = (-0.82e) × (1.012 × 10^(-10) m)\n\nTo find the total dipole moment of ammonia, we need to consider the vector sum of the three bond dipole moments. Due to the trigonal pyramidal geometry of ammonia, the bond angle between the N-H bonds is approximately 107.5°. Using vector addition and trigonometry, we can find the total dipole moment:\n\nμ_total = μ_NH × √(1 + 2 × cos(107.5°))\n\nPlugging in the values and solving for μ_total:\n\nμ_total ≈ 1.47 Debye\n\nThe dipole moment of ammonia (NH3) is approximately 1.47 Debye."
