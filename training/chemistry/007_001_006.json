    "message_2": "Designing new drugs for cancer treatment with higher specificity towards cancer cells and lower toxicity towards healthy cells can be achieved through several strategies:\n\n1. Targeting cancer-specific molecular markers: Identify unique molecular markers or proteins that are overexpressed or mutated in cancer cells compared to healthy cells. Design drugs that specifically target these markers, which will help minimize the impact on healthy cells.\n\n2. Utilizing prodrugs: Prodrugs are inactive compounds that are converted into active drugs within the body, often by enzymes. Design prodrugs that are selectively activated by enzymes or conditions specific to the tumor microenvironment, such as low oxygen levels or acidic pH.\n\n3. Employing antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs): ADCs are a combination of a monoclonal antibody and a cytotoxic drug. The antibody specifically targets a cancer cell surface antigen, delivering the drug directly to the cancer cell and minimizing damage to healthy cells.\n\n4. Exploiting cancer cell metabolism: Cancer cells often have altered metabolism compared to healthy cells. Design drugs that target specific metabolic pathways or enzymes that are upregulated in cancer cells, which will help spare healthy cells.\n\n5. Using nanotechnology: Develop nanocarriers, such as liposomes or nanoparticles, to encapsulate and deliver drugs specifically to cancer cells. These carriers can be designed to release their payload in response to specific stimuli found in the tumor microenvironment or upon internalization by cancer cells.\n\n6. Personalized medicine: Utilize genomic and proteomic data to identify specific mutations or molecular markers in an individual's cancer cells. Design drugs that target these specific alterations, increasing the likelihood of a successful treatment with minimal side effects.\n\n7. Combination therapy: Combine multiple drugs that target different aspects of cancer cell biology, such as growth, survival, and resistance mechanisms. This approach can increase the efficacy of treatment while reducing the likelihood of drug resistance and toxicity.\n\n8. Immunotherapy: Develop drugs that stimulate the patient's immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells, while leaving healthy cells unharmed. This can be achieved through immune checkpoint inhibitors, cancer vaccines, or adoptive cell transfer.\n\nBy employing these strategies, researchers can design new drugs for cancer treatment with higher specificity towards cancer cells and lower toxicity towards healthy cells, ultimately improving patient outcomes."
