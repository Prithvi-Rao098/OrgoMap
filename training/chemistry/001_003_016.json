    "message_2": "2,3-dichlorobutane has two chiral centers, which are carbons 2 and 3. Therefore, there are 2^n possible stereoisomers, where n is the number of chiral centers. In this case, n=2, so there are 2^2 = 4 possible stereoisomers. These stereoisomers are:\n\n1. (2R,3R)-2,3-dichlorobutane\nStructure: H3C-CHCl-CHCl-CH3\nChiral centers: C2 (R) and C3 (R)\n\n2. (2S,3S)-2,3-dichlorobutane\nStructure: H3C-CHCl-CHCl-CH3\nChiral centers: C2 (S) and C3 (S)\n\n3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dichlorobutane\nStructure: H3C-CHCl-CHCl-CH3\nChiral centers: C2 (R) and C3 (S)\n\n4. (2S,3R)-2,3-dichlorobutane\nStructure: H3C-CHCl-CHCl-CH3\nChiral centers: C2 (S) and C3 (R)\n\nThese four stereoisomers include two pairs of enantiomers: (2R,3R) and (2S,3S), and (2R,3S) and (2S,3R)."
