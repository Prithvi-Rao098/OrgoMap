    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG = Σ ΔGf(products) - Σ ΔGf(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔGf represents the standard Gibbs free energy of formation of the respective compounds.\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\n2NO(g) + O2(g) → 2NO2(g)\n\nΔG = [2 × ΔGf(NO2)] - [2 × ΔGf(NO) + ΔGf(O2)]\n\nWe are given the standard Gibbs free energy of formation for NO, O2, and NO2 as +90.4 kJ/mol, 0 kJ/mol, and +51.3 kJ/mol, respectively.\n\nSubstitute the given values into the equation:\n\nΔG = [2 × (+51.3 kJ/mol)] - [2 × (+90.4 kJ/mol) + 0 kJ/mol]\n\nΔG = [102.6 kJ/mol] - [180.8 kJ/mol]\n\nΔG = -78.2 kJ/mol\n\nThe Gibbs free energy change at 25°C for the reaction is -78.2 kJ/mol."
