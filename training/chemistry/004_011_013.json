    "message_2": "To determine the structure and functional groups present in the unknown organic compound with a molecular formula of C10H12O2 using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we would need to analyze both the 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra. However, since the actual spectra are not provided, I will provide a general approach to solving this problem.\n\n1. First, calculate the degree of unsaturation (DU) using the molecular formula. DU helps to identify the presence of double bonds, triple bonds, or rings in the compound.\n\nDU = (2C + 2 + N - H - X) / 2\nwhere C is the number of carbons, N is the number of nitrogens, H is the number of hydrogens, and X is the number of halogens.\n\nFor C10H12O2:\nDU = (2 * 10 + 2 - 12) / 2 = 4\n\nThe compound has 4 degrees of unsaturation, which could be a combination of double bonds, triple bonds, or rings.\n\n2. Analyze the 1H NMR spectrum:\n\n- Look for characteristic chemical shifts and coupling patterns that indicate specific functional groups or structural features.\n- Identify the integration values for each signal, which represent the number of protons contributing to that signal.\n\n3. Analyze the 13C NMR spectrum:\n\n- Look for characteristic chemical shifts that indicate specific functional groups or structural features.\n- Identify the number of unique carbon environments in the compound.\n\n4. Combine the information from both the 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra to propose a structure for the unknown compound.\n\n- Use the DU value to guide the placement of double bonds, triple bonds, or rings in the structure.\n- Assign the NMR signals to specific protons and carbons in the proposed structure.\n- Verify that the proposed structure is consistent with all the data from the NMR spectra.\n\nWithout the actual NMR spectra, it is not possible to provide a specific structure for the unknown compound. However, following these steps should allow you to determine the structure and functional groups present in the compound once you have the NMR data."
