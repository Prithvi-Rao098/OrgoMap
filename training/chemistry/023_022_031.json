    "message_2": "To determine the maximum yield of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid from 10 grams of benzoic acid, we need to first find the stoichiometry of the reaction and then use the limiting reactant to calculate the theoretical yield.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the nitration of benzoic acid is:\n\nC7H6O2 (benzoic acid) + 2 HNO3 (nitric acid) → C7H4N2O6 (2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid) + 2 H2O (water)\n\nNow, we need to find the moles of benzoic acid:\n\nMoles = mass (g) / molar mass (g/mol)\n\nThe molar mass of benzoic acid (C7H6O2) is 122.12 g/mol.\n\nMoles of benzoic acid = 10 g / 122.12 g/mol = 0.0819 mol\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1 between benzoic acid and 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid, the moles of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid produced will also be 0.0819 mol.\n\nNow, we need to find the mass of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid:\n\nMass = moles × molar mass\n\nThe molar mass of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid (C7H4N2O6) is 212.12 g/mol.\n\nMass of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid = 0.0819 mol × 212.12 g/mol = 17.37 g\n\nSo, the maximum yield of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid that can be obtained from 10 grams of benzoic acid reacting with excess nitric acid using the preparation method is 17.37 grams."
