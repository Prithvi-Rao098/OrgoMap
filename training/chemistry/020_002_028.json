    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant, Kc, for the given reaction, we can use the formula:\n\nKc = [NO]^2 * [Br2] / [NOBr]^2\n\nWe are given the equilibrium concentrations as [NOBr] = 0.015M, [NO] = 0.025M, and [Br2] = 0.025M. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nKc = (0.025)^2 * (0.025) / (0.015)^2\n\nKc = 0.000625 * 0.025 / 0.000225\n\nKc ≈ 6.944\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant, Kc, for the given reaction is approximately 6.944."
