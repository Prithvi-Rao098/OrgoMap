    "message_2": "In the ClO4- ion (perchlorate ion), the chlorine atom is the central atom surrounded by four oxygen atoms. To determine the hybridization of the chlorine atom, we need to consider its electron domains.\n\nChlorine has 7 valence electrons, and in ClO4-, it forms one single bond with each of the four oxygen atoms. Additionally, there is one extra electron from the negative charge on the ion. So, chlorine has a total of 7 + 1 = 8 electrons in its valence shell.\n\nThese 8 electrons are distributed in 4 electron domains (4 single bonds with oxygen atoms). To accommodate these 4 electron domains, the chlorine atom needs to use one s orbital, two p orbitals, and one d orbital. Therefore, the hybridization of the chlorine atom in ClO4- is sp3d."
