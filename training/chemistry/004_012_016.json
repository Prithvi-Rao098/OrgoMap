    "message_2": "Caffeine has the molecular formula C8H10N4O2. To determine the percentage composition of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen, we first need to calculate the molar mass of caffeine and the molar mass of each element in the compound.\n\nMolar mass of caffeine:\nCarbon (C) = 8 atoms × 12.01 g/mol = 96.08 g/mol\nHydrogen (H) = 10 atoms × 1.01 g/mol = 10.10 g/mol\nNitrogen (N) = 4 atoms × 14.01 g/mol = 56.04 g/mol\nOxygen (O) = 2 atoms × 16.00 g/mol = 32.00 g/mol\n\nTotal molar mass of caffeine = 96.08 + 10.10 + 56.04 + 32.00 = 194.22 g/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the percentage composition of each element:\n\nPercentage of Carbon (C):\n(96.08 g/mol C / 194.22 g/mol caffeine) × 100% = 49.48%\n\nPercentage of Hydrogen (H):\n(10.10 g/mol H / 194.22 g/mol caffeine) × 100% = 5.20%\n\nPercentage of Nitrogen (N):\n(56.04 g/mol N / 194.22 g/mol caffeine) × 100% = 28.85%\n\nSo, the percentage composition of caffeine is approximately 49.48% carbon, 5.20% hydrogen, and 28.85% nitrogen."
