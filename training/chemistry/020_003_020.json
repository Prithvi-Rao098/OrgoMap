    "message_1": "If the reaction A + B â‡Œ C is at equilibrium at a certain temperature and pressure, and the concentration of A is doubled while the concentration of B is cut in half, what will be the direction and extent of the reaction shift to re-establish equilibrium?",
    "message_2": "To determine the direction and extent of the reaction shift, we can use Le Chatelier's principle. This principle states that if a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in concentration, temperature, or pressure, the system will adjust to counteract the change and re-establish equilibrium.\n\nIn this case, the concentration of A is doubled, and the concentration of B is cut in half. This disturbs the equilibrium, and the system will adjust to counteract these changes.\n\nSince the concentration of A has increased, the reaction will shift to the right (towards the formation of C) to consume some of the excess A. Similarly, since the concentration of B has decreased, the reaction will also shift to the right to produce more B. \n\nThe extent of the reaction shift will depend on the equilibrium constant (K) for the reaction. The reaction will continue to shift to the right until the ratio of the concentrations of the reactants and products once again equals the equilibrium constant. The exact extent of the shift cannot be determined without knowing the values of the equilibrium constant and the initial concentrations of A, B, and C."
