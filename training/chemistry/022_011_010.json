    "message_1": "What volume of carbon dioxide gas (CO2) will be produced at STP when 25 g of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) reacts completely with hydrochloric acid (HCl)?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction.\n2. Calculate the number of moles of CaCO3.\n3. Determine the number of moles of CO2 produced.\n4. Calculate the volume of CO2 at STP.\n\nStep 1: Balanced chemical equation\nCaCO3 (s) + 2 HCl (aq) → CaCl2 (aq) + H2O (l) + CO2 (g)\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of moles of CaCO3\nThe molar mass of CaCO3 = (40.08 for Ca) + (12.01 for C) + (3 × 16.00 for O) = 100.09 g/mol\nNumber of moles of CaCO3 = mass / molar mass = 25 g / 100.09 g/mol = 0.2498 mol\n\nStep 3: Determine the number of moles of CO2 produced\nFrom the balanced equation, 1 mole of CaCO3 produces 1 mole of CO2.\nSo, 0.2498 mol of CaCO3 will produce 0.2498 mol of CO2.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the volume of CO2 at STP\nAt STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure: 0°C and 1 atm), 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\nVolume of CO2 = number of moles × volume per mole at STP = 0.2498 mol × 22.4 L/mol = 5.59 L\n\nTherefore, the volume of CO2 produced at STP when 25 g of CaCO3 reacts completely with HCl is 5.59 L."
