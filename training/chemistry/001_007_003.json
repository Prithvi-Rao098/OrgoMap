    "message_2": "Under normal conditions, benzene does not readily react with bromine due to the high stability of the benzene ring, which results from the delocalization of its pi electrons. However, when a catalyst is present, the reaction proceeds via electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n\nHere's the mechanism of the reaction between benzene and bromine in the presence of a catalyst, such as FeBr3 or AlBr3:\n\n1. Catalyst activation: The catalyst (e.g., FeBr3) reacts with a bromine molecule (Br2) to form a complex, generating the electrophile Br+ and a bromide ion (Br-).\n   FeBr3 + Br2 → [FeBr4]- + Br+\n\n2. Electrophilic attack: The electrophile Br+ attacks the benzene ring, breaking one of the pi bonds and forming a sigma bond between the bromine atom and one of the carbon atoms in the ring. This results in a positively charged cyclohexadienyl cation (also known as an arenium ion) and disrupts the aromaticity of the benzene ring.\n\n3. Deprotonation: A base, usually the bromide ion (Br-) formed in the first step, abstracts a proton from the cyclohexadienyl cation, restoring the aromaticity of the benzene ring and forming a new C-Br bond. The catalyst is also regenerated in this step.\n   [C6H6Br]+ + Br- → C6H5Br + HBr\n\nThe overall reaction is:\n   C6H6 + Br2 → C6H5Br + HBr (in the presence of a catalyst)\n\nIn summary, under normal conditions, benzene does not react with bromine due to its high stability. However, in the presence of a catalyst, the reaction proceeds via electrophilic aromatic substitution, resulting in the formation of bromobenzene and hydrogen bromide."
