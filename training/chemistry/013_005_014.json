    "message_2": "To calculate the specific surface area of the porous material, we can use the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory, which relates the amount of gas adsorbed to the surface area of the adsorbent. In this case, we have the following information:\n\n- Volume of nitrogen gas adsorbed (V_ads) = 10 mL\n- Temperature (T) = 77 K\n- Pressure (P) = 1 atm\n- Monolayer thickness (t) = 2.5 nm\n- Cross-sectional area of a nitrogen molecule (A_N2) = 0.16 nm^2\n\nFirst, we need to convert the volume of nitrogen gas adsorbed to the number of moles (n_ads) using the ideal gas law:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nWhere:\n- P = pressure (1 atm)\n- V = volume (10 mL = 0.01 L)\n- n = number of moles\n- R = ideal gas constant (0.0821 L atm / (mol K))\n- T = temperature (77 K)\n\nn_ads = PV / RT\nn_ads = (1 atm * 0.01 L) / (0.0821 L atm / (mol K) * 77 K)\nn_ads ≈ 0.000159 mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the total surface area (A_total) of the porous material covered by the nitrogen molecules:\n\nA_total = n_ads * A_N2 / t\nA_total = (0.000159 mol * 0.16 nm^2) / 2.5 nm\nA_total ≈ 1.02 × 10^-5 m^2\n\nFinally, we can calculate the specific surface area (SSA) of the porous material by dividing the total surface area by the mass of the adsorbent. However, we do not have the mass of the adsorbent in the given information. If the mass of the adsorbent is provided, the specific surface area can be calculated as follows:\n\nSSA = A_total / mass of adsorbent"
