    "message_1": "A student needs to calculate the efficiency of an electrochemical cell that has a potential difference of 1.5 volts and a current of 0.5 amperes passing through it, with the help of Faraday's Law. If the electrode reaction produces chlorine gas with a Faraday efficiency of 79%, and the overall voltage efficiency of the cell is 85%, what is the efficiency of the electrochemical cell?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the efficiency of the electrochemical cell, we need to consider both the Faraday efficiency and the voltage efficiency.\n\nFaraday efficiency (FE) is the efficiency with which charge is transferred in a system facilitating an electrochemical reaction. In this case, the Faraday efficiency is 79%.\n\nVoltage efficiency (VE) is the efficiency with which the potential difference (voltage) is utilized in the electrochemical cell. In this case, the voltage efficiency is 85%.\n\nThe overall efficiency of the electrochemical cell can be calculated by multiplying the Faraday efficiency and the voltage efficiency:\n\nEfficiency = Faraday Efficiency × Voltage Efficiency\nEfficiency = 0.79 × 0.85\n\nEfficiency = 0.6715 or 67.15%\n\nSo, the efficiency of the electrochemical cell is 67.15%."
