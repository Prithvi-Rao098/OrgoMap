    "message_2": "To calculate the pH of a 0.1 M solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl), we need to find the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in the solution. HCl is a strong acid, which means it dissociates completely in water, so the concentration of H+ ions will be equal to the concentration of HCl.\n\npH = -log10[H+]\n\nSince the concentration of HCl is 0.1 M, the concentration of H+ ions will also be 0.1 M.\n\npH = -log10(0.1)\n\npH = 1\n\nSo, the pH of a 0.1 M solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl) is 1."
