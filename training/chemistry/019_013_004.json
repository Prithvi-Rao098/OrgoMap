    "message_2": "The standard enthalpy change for the neutralization reaction between hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to form sodium chloride (NaCl) and water (H2O) at a constant pressure and temperature of 298 K is approximately -57.32 kJ/mol. This value represents the heat released when one mole of HCl reacts with one mole of NaOH under standard conditions."
