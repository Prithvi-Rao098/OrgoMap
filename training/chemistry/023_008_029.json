    "message_2": "To determine the appropriate ratio of aniline to nitric acid, we first need to find the amount of aniline required to synthesize 5 grams of p-nitroaniline with a yield of 85%.\n\n1. Calculate the theoretical yield:\nActual yield (p-nitroaniline) = 5 g\nPercentage yield = 85%\n\nTheoretical yield = Actual yield / Percentage yield\nTheoretical yield = 5 g / 0.85 = 5.88 g\n\n2. Determine the moles of p-nitroaniline in the theoretical yield:\nMolar mass of p-nitroaniline = 138.12 g/mol (C6H6N2O2)\n\nMoles of p-nitroaniline = Theoretical yield / Molar mass\nMoles of p-nitroaniline = 5.88 g / 138.12 g/mol = 0.0426 mol\n\n3. Determine the moles of aniline required:\nThe balanced chemical equation for the synthesis of p-nitroaniline is:\n\nC6H7N (aniline) + HNO3 (nitric acid) → C6H6N2O2 (p-nitroaniline) + H2O\n\nFrom the balanced equation, 1 mole of aniline reacts with 1 mole of nitric acid to produce 1 mole of p-nitroaniline.\n\nMoles of aniline required = Moles of p-nitroaniline = 0.0426 mol\n\n4. Determine the mass of aniline required:\nMolar mass of aniline = 93.13 g/mol (C6H7N)\n\nMass of aniline = Moles of aniline × Molar mass\nMass of aniline = 0.0426 mol × 93.13 g/mol = 3.97 g\n\n5. Determine the mass of nitric acid required:\nMolar mass of nitric acid = 63.01 g/mol (HNO3)\n\nMass of nitric acid = Moles of p-nitroaniline × Molar mass\nMass of nitric acid = 0.0426 mol × 63.01 g/mol = 2.68 g\n\n6. Calculate the ratio of aniline to nitric acid:\nRatio = Mass of aniline / Mass of nitric acid\nRatio = 3.97 g / 2.68 g = 1.48\n\nThe appropriate ratio of aniline to nitric acid needed to synthesize 5 grams of p-nitroaniline with a yield of 85% is approximately 1.48:1."
