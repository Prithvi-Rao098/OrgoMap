    "message_2": "To prepare benzocaine from p-aminobenzoic acid and ethanol, we need to perform an esterification reaction. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nC7H7NO2 (p-aminobenzoic acid) + C2H5OH (ethanol) → C9H11NO2 (benzocaine) + H2O (water)\n\nTo calculate the theoretical yield of benzocaine, we need to use stoichiometry. First, we need to find the molar mass of p-aminobenzoic acid and benzocaine.\n\nMolar mass of p-aminobenzoic acid (C7H7NO2) = (7 × 12.01) + (7 × 1.01) + (1 × 14.01) + (2 × 16.00) = 137.14 g/mol\n\nMolar mass of benzocaine (C9H11NO2) = (9 × 12.01) + (11 × 1.01) + (1 × 14.01) + (2 × 16.00) = 165.19 g/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the moles of p-aminobenzoic acid used in the reaction:\n\nmoles of p-aminobenzoic acid = mass / molar mass = 5 g / 137.14 g/mol = 0.0364 mol\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, the moles of benzocaine produced will be equal to the moles of p-aminobenzoic acid used:\n\nmoles of benzocaine = 0.0364 mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the theoretical yield of benzocaine:\n\nmass of benzocaine = moles × molar mass = 0.0364 mol × 165.19 g/mol = 6.01 g\n\nThe theoretical yield of benzocaine that can be obtained from 5 grams of p-aminobenzoic acid reacted with excess ethanol is 6.01 grams."
