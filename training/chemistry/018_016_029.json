    "message_2": "The addition of a reaction intermediate to a chemical reaction can affect the rate of the reaction by increasing it. The mechanism behind this phenomenon is related to the concept of reaction intermediates and their role in multi-step reactions.\n\nA reaction intermediate is a species that is formed during a multi-step reaction but is not present in the overall balanced equation, as it is consumed in a subsequent step. They are usually unstable and highly reactive, which allows them to participate in the reaction and facilitate the conversion of reactants to products.\n\nWhen a reaction intermediate is added to a chemical reaction, it can affect the rate of the reaction in the following ways:\n\n1. Bypassing the rate-determining step: In a multi-step reaction, the slowest step is known as the rate-determining step, which ultimately governs the overall rate of the reaction. By adding a reaction intermediate, it is possible to bypass the rate-determining step, effectively increasing the rate of the reaction. This is because the added intermediate can directly react with the reactants or other intermediates, allowing the reaction to proceed more quickly.\n\n2. Increasing the concentration of reactive species: The addition of a reaction intermediate increases the concentration of reactive species in the reaction mixture. According to the collision theory, an increase in the concentration of reactive species leads to a higher frequency of effective collisions between reactant molecules, which in turn increases the rate of the reaction.\n\n3. Altering the reaction mechanism: In some cases, the addition of a reaction intermediate can change the reaction mechanism, leading to the formation of a new reaction pathway with a lower activation energy. This can result in an increase in the rate of the reaction, as the reaction can now proceed more easily through the new pathway.\n\nIn summary, the addition of a reaction intermediate to a chemical reaction can increase the rate of the reaction by bypassing the rate-determining step, increasing the concentration of reactive species, and altering the reaction mechanism. However, it is important to note that the specific effect of adding a reaction intermediate will depend on the particular reaction and the intermediate involved."
