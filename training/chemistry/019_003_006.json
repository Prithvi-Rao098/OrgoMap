    "message_2": "To calculate the heat capacity of water, we can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere:\nq = heat capacity (Joules)\nm = mass of water (grams)\nc = specific heat capacity of water (4.18 J/g°C)\nΔT = change in temperature (°C)\n\nGiven:\nm = 50 g\nΔT = 65°C - 25°C = 40°C\nc = 4.18 J/g°C\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nq = (50 g) × (4.18 J/g°C) × (40°C)\n\nq = 50 × 4.18 × 40\n\nq = 8376 Joules\n\nThe heat capacity of 50g of water when its temperature is raised from 25°C to 65°C is 8376 Joules."
