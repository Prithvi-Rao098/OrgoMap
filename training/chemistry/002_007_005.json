    "message_2": "When copper (II) sulfate solution is mixed with sodium hydroxide solution, the products formed are copper (II) hydroxide and sodium sulfate. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nCuSO₄ (aq) + 2 NaOH (aq) → Cu(OH)₂ (s) + Na₂SO₄ (aq)\n\nThe type of reaction occurring here is a double displacement (or metathesis) reaction, where the cations and anions of the two reactants exchange partners to form new products."
