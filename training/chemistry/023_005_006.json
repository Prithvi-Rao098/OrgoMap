    "message_2": "The synthesis of ibuprofen from 2-methylpropylbenzene (also known as isobutylbenzene) and carbon dioxide involves several steps. The key steps in the reaction are Friedel-Crafts acylation, hydrolysis, and Kolbe-Schmitt carboxylation. Here is a detailed mechanism of the synthesis:\n\n1. Friedel-Crafts Acylation:\nIn the first step, 2-methylpropylbenzene reacts with acetyl chloride in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, such as aluminum chloride (AlCl3). The catalyst activates the acetyl chloride by forming a complex with it, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic. The 2-methylpropylbenzene then attacks the carbonyl carbon, resulting in the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond. The complex breaks apart, and the final product of this step is 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanoyl chloride.\n\n2. Hydrolysis:\nThe next step is the hydrolysis of the acyl chloride group in 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanoyl chloride. This is achieved by treating the compound with water, which results in the replacement of the chloride group with a hydroxyl group. The product of this step is 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanoic acid, also known as α-methyl-4-isobutylphenylacetic acid.\n\n3. Kolbe-Schmitt Carboxylation:\nThe final step in the synthesis of ibuprofen is the Kolbe-Schmitt carboxylation reaction. In this step, the α-methyl-4-isobutylphenylacetic acid is treated with carbon dioxide and a strong base, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH), under high pressure and temperature. The base deprotonates the phenolic hydroxyl group, forming a phenoxide ion. The phenoxide ion then attacks the carbon dioxide, forming a new carbon-carbon bond. The resulting compound is the sodium salt of ibuprofen, which can be converted to the free acid form by treatment with a strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl).\n\nIn summary, the synthesis of ibuprofen from 2-methylpropylbenzene and carbon dioxide involves Friedel-Crafts acylation, hydrolysis, and Kolbe-Schmitt carboxylation. These steps result in the formation of the desired ibuprofen molecule."
