    "message_2": "The Lewis structure of the carbon dioxide (CO2) molecule is as follows:\n\nO = C = O\n\nIn this structure, the central carbon atom is double-bonded to two oxygen atoms. The carbon atom has four valence electrons, and each oxygen atom has six valence electrons. The double bonds between the carbon and oxygen atoms account for the sharing of four electrons (two from each atom), satisfying the octet rule for all three atoms."
