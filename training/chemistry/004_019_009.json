    "message_1": "What is the concentration of iron(II) sulfate in a sample of water taken from a lake, using spectrophotometry with a known molar absorptivity of 11,300 L/mol*cm, if the absorbance of the sample is measured to be 0.423 at a wavelength of 510 nm?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the concentration of iron(II) sulfate in the sample, we can use the Beer-Lambert Law, which states:\n\nA = ε * c * l\n\nwhere A is the absorbance, ε is the molar absorptivity (L/mol*cm), c is the concentration (mol/L), and l is the path length (cm).\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nA = 0.423\nε = 11,300 L/mol*cm\nl = 1 cm (assuming a standard cuvette)\n\nWe need to solve for c (the concentration):\n\n0.423 = 11,300 * c * 1\n\nNow, divide both sides by 11,300:\n\nc = 0.423 / 11,300\nc ≈ 0.0000374 mol/L\n\nSo, the concentration of iron(II) sulfate in the sample is approximately 0.0000374 mol/L or 37.4 µmol/L."
