    "message_2": "To calculate the activity of the radon-222 sample after 15 days, we can use the radioactive decay formula:\n\nActivity_final = Activity_initial * (1/2)^(time_elapsed / half_life)\n\nWhere:\nActivity_initial = 600 Bq (initial activity)\ntime_elapsed = 15 days\nhalf_life = 3.8 days\n\nActivity_final = 600 Bq * (1/2)^(15 / 3.8)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nActivity_final = 600 Bq * (1/2)^(3.947368421)\n\nActivity_final = 600 Bq * 0.049787068\n\nActivity_final â‰ˆ 29.872241 Bq\n\nSo, the activity of the radon-222 sample after 15 days is approximately 29.87 Bq."
