    "message_2": "To balance the chemical equation for the reaction between iron (III) oxide and carbon monoxide to produce iron and carbon dioxide gas, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of atoms for each element on both sides of the equation.\n   Left side: Fe = 2, O = 3, C = 1\n   Right side: Fe = 1, O = 2, C = 1\n\n2. Balance the elements one by one, starting with the element that appears least frequently. In this case, start with iron (Fe).\n   Multiply the right side by 2 to balance the iron atoms:\n   Fe2O3(s) + CO(g) → 2Fe(s) + CO2(g)\n\n3. Now, check the oxygen atoms. There are 3 oxygen atoms on the left side and 2 on the right side. To balance the oxygen atoms, multiply the CO molecule on the left side by 3:\n   Fe2O3(s) + 3CO(g) → 2Fe(s) + CO2(g)\n\n4. Check the carbon atoms. There are now 3 carbon atoms on the left side and 1 on the right side. To balance the carbon atoms, multiply the CO2 molecule on the right side by 3:\n   Fe2O3(s) + 3CO(g) → 2Fe(s) + 3CO2(g)\n\n5. Verify that the equation is balanced:\n   Left side: Fe = 2, O = 3, C = 3\n   Right side: Fe = 2, O = 3, C = 3\n\nThe balanced chemical equation is:\n\nFe2O3(s) + 3CO(g) → 2Fe(s) + 3CO2(g)"
