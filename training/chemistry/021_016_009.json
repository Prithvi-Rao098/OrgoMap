    "message_2": "To find the electronegativity difference between chlorine (Cl) and sodium (Na) in sodium chloride (NaCl), we need to look at their respective electronegativity values on the Pauling scale.\n\nThe electronegativity value for chlorine (Cl) is 3.16, and for sodium (Na), it is 0.93.\n\nNow, subtract the electronegativity value of sodium (Na) from that of chlorine (Cl):\n\nElectronegativity difference = Electronegativity of Cl - Electronegativity of Na\nElectronegativity difference = 3.16 - 0.93\nElectronegativity difference = 2.23\n\nSo, the electronegativity difference between chlorine (Cl) and sodium (Na) in sodium chloride (NaCl) is 2.23."
