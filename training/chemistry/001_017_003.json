    "message_2": "To find the net ionic equation for the reaction between potassium permanganate (KMnO4) and oxalic acid (H2C2O4) in an acidic solution, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation and then determine the net ionic equation.\n\nBalanced chemical equation:\n2 KMnO4 + 5 H2C2O4 + 6 H2SO4 → 2 MnSO4 + 10 CO2 + 8 H2O + 6 K2SO4\n\nNow, we write the total ionic equation by breaking down all the strong electrolytes into their respective ions:\n\n2 K⁺ + 2 MnO₄⁻ + 5 H₂C₂O₄ + 12 H⁺ + 6 SO₄²⁻ → 2 Mn²⁺ + 2 SO₄²⁻ + 10 CO₂ + 8 H₂O + 12 K⁺ + 6 SO₄²⁻\n\nNow, we can identify and remove the spectator ions (ions that appear on both sides of the equation):\n\nSpectator ions: 2 SO₄²⁻, 12 K⁺\n\nNet ionic equation:\n2 MnO₄⁻ + 5 H₂C₂O₄ + 12 H⁺ → 2 Mn²⁺ + 10 CO₂ + 8 H₂O\n\nThis is the net ionic equation for the reaction between potassium permanganate and oxalic acid in an acidic solution."
