    "message_1": "What is the maximum yield of benzocaine that can be obtained from the reaction between p-aminobenzoic acid and ethanol, assuming 100% conversion of the reactants and a starting mass of 5 grams of p-aminobenzoic acid with excess ethanol?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the maximum yield of benzocaine, we need to use the stoichiometry of the reaction and the molecular weights of the reactants and product.\n\nThe reaction between p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) and ethanol to form benzocaine is as follows:\n\nPABA + ethanol â†’ benzocaine + water\n\nThe molecular weights of the compounds are:\n\nPABA: 137.14 g/mol\nEthanol: 46.07 g/mol (not needed in this calculation since it's in excess)\nBenzocaine: 165.19 g/mol\n\nNow, we can use the starting mass of PABA (5 grams) to determine the maximum yield of benzocaine:\n\n5 g PABA * (1 mol PABA / 137.14 g PABA) * (1 mol benzocaine / 1 mol PABA) * (165.19 g benzocaine / 1 mol benzocaine)\n\nThe units of PABA and moles cancel out, leaving us with the mass of benzocaine:\n\n5 g * (1 / 137.14) * (165.19) = 6.01 g benzocaine\n\nSo, the maximum yield of benzocaine that can be obtained from the reaction is 6.01 grams, assuming 100% conversion of the reactants."
