    "message_2": "When the concentration of one of the reactants in a chemical reaction is increased while keeping the concentration of another reactant constant, the equilibrium position will shift according to Le Chatelier's Principle. Le Chatelier's Principle states that if a change is applied to a system at equilibrium, the system will adjust itself to counteract the change and restore a new equilibrium.\n\nIn this case, increasing the concentration of one reactant will cause the system to shift in the direction that consumes the added reactant, in order to counteract the change and restore equilibrium. This shift will result in the formation of more products and a new equilibrium position.\n\nFor example, consider the following reversible reaction:\n\nA + B ⇌ C + D\n\nIf the concentration of reactant A is increased while the concentration of reactant B is kept constant, the equilibrium will shift to the right, favoring the formation of products C and D. This shift will continue until a new equilibrium position is established, where the rate of the forward reaction (A + B → C + D) equals the rate of the reverse reaction (C + D → A + B).\n\nIn summary, increasing the concentration of one reactant while keeping another reactant constant will cause the equilibrium position to shift in the direction that consumes the added reactant, resulting in the formation of more products and a new equilibrium position."
