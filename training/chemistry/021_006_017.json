    "message_2": "The dipole moment of a molecule is a measure of its polarity, which is determined by the difference in electronegativity between the atoms and the distance between them. For carbon monoxide (CO), the electronegativity values are 2.55 for carbon (C) and 3.44 for oxygen (O).\n\nTo calculate the dipole moment (μ), we can use the formula:\n\nμ = Q × d\n\nwhere Q is the charge difference between the atoms (in Debye, D) and d is the distance between the atoms (in Ångström, Å).\n\nFirst, we need to find the charge difference (Q) between the carbon and oxygen atoms. The difference in electronegativity between C and O is:\n\nΔEN = 3.44 - 2.55 = 0.89\n\nSince the bond in CO is a triple bond, we can assume that the charge difference is approximately equal to the difference in electronegativity:\n\nQ ≈ ΔEN = 0.89 D\n\nNext, we need to find the distance between the carbon and oxygen atoms (d). The bond length of CO is approximately 1.128 Å.\n\nNow, we can calculate the dipole moment (μ):\n\nμ = Q × d\nμ = 0.89 D × 1.128 Å\nμ ≈ 1.00 D\n\nTherefore, the dipole moment of carbon monoxide (CO) is approximately 1.00 Debye."
