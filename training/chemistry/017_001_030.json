    "message_2": "The rate of a photochemical reaction, such as the conversion of cis-2-butene into trans-2-butene, is directly influenced by the intensity of light. This is because photochemical reactions rely on the absorption of light energy (photons) to promote the reactants to a higher energy state, allowing the reaction to proceed.\n\nIn the case of cis-2-butene converting to trans-2-butene, the reaction involves the breaking of the pi bond between the carbon atoms and the formation of a new pi bond in a different orientation. This process is initiated by the absorption of a photon, which provides the necessary energy for the bond rotation.\n\nThe relationship between light intensity and the rate of a photochemical reaction can be described by the following factors:\n\n1. The number of photons absorbed by the reactants: As the light intensity increases, more photons are available to be absorbed by the cis-2-butene molecules. This increases the probability of a molecule absorbing a photon and undergoing the reaction, leading to a higher reaction rate.\n\n2. The quantum yield of the reaction: Quantum yield is the ratio of the number of molecules that undergo the reaction to the number of photons absorbed. If the quantum yield is high, it means that a large proportion of the absorbed photons result in a successful reaction, leading to a faster reaction rate.\n\n3. The absorption spectrum of the reactants: The absorption spectrum of a molecule determines the wavelengths of light that can be absorbed and used to initiate the reaction. If the absorption spectrum of cis-2-butene overlaps well with the light source's emission spectrum, the reaction rate will be higher.\n\nIn summary, the rate of the photochemical reaction involving the conversion of cis-2-butene into trans-2-butene will increase with increasing light intensity, as long as other factors such as temperature and reactant concentration remain constant. This is because a higher light intensity provides more photons to be absorbed by the reactants, increasing the probability of a successful reaction."
