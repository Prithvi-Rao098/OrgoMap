    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy of formation of water using Hess's law, we need to manipulate the given reactions to match the desired reaction: H2(g) + 1/2O2(g) -> H2O(g).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the second reaction from liquid water to gaseous water. To do this, we need to consider the enthalpy of vaporization of water:\n\nH2O(l) -> H2O(g) ΔH°vap = 44 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can add the enthalpy of vaporization to the second reaction to get the formation of gaseous water:\n\nH2(g) + 1/2O2(g) -> H2O(g) ΔH°rxn = -286 kJ/mol + 44 kJ/mol = -242 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can compare the first reaction to the desired reaction. The first reaction produces 2 moles of gaseous water, while the desired reaction produces only 1 mole. Therefore, we need to divide the first reaction by 2:\n\n1/2(2H2(g) + O2(g) -> 2H2O(g)) ΔH°rxn = 1/2(-484 kJ/mol) = -242 kJ/mol\n\nNow, both reactions are equivalent:\n\nH2(g) + 1/2O2(g) -> H2O(g) ΔH°rxn = -242 kJ/mol\n\nThus, the standard enthalpy of formation of water (gaseous) is -242 kJ/mol."
