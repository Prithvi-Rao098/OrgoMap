    "message_2": "To calculate the binding energy per nucleon, we first need to find the mass defect of the carbon-14 nucleus. The mass defect is the difference between the mass of the individual nucleons (protons and neutrons) and the mass of the nucleus itself.\n\nThe mass of a proton is approximately 1.007276 u, and the mass of a neutron is approximately 1.008665 u.\n\nTotal mass of 6 protons = 6 * 1.007276 u = 6.043656 u\nTotal mass of 8 neutrons = 8 * 1.008665 u = 8.069320 u\nTotal mass of individual nucleons = 6.043656 u + 8.069320 u = 14.112976 u\n\nNow, we can find the mass defect:\n\nMass defect = Total mass of individual nucleons - Mass of carbon-14 nucleus\nMass defect = 14.112976 u - 14.003242 u = 0.109734 u\n\nTo convert the mass defect to energy, we use Einstein's famous equation, E=mc^2, where E is energy, m is mass, and c is the speed of light. In this case, we will use the conversion factor of 1 u = 931.5 MeV/c^2.\n\nBinding energy = Mass defect * 931.5 MeV/c^2\nBinding energy = 0.109734 u * 931.5 MeV/c^2 = 102.210 MeV\n\nNow, we can find the binding energy per nucleon by dividing the binding energy by the total number of nucleons (protons + neutrons).\n\nBinding energy per nucleon = Binding energy / Total number of nucleons\nBinding energy per nucleon = 102.210 MeV / (6 protons + 8 neutrons)\nBinding energy per nucleon = 102.210 MeV / 14 nucleons = 7.301 MeV/nucleon\n\nSo, the binding energy per nucleon for this carbon-14 nucleus is approximately 7.301 MeV/nucleon."
