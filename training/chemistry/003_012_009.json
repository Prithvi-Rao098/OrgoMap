    "message_2": "To calculate the diffusivity of oxygen gas in air at 25°C and 1 atm pressure, we can use the Chapman-Enskog equation, which is given by:\n\nD = (3/16) * (k * T) / (π * d^2 * P)\n\nwhere:\nD is the diffusivity (m²/s)\nk is the Boltzmann constant (1.38064852 × 10⁻²³ J/K)\nT is the temperature in Kelvin (K)\nd is the collision diameter (m)\nP is the pressure (Pa)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin:\n\nT = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\n\nNext, we need to find the collision diameter (d) for oxygen gas. The collision diameter of oxygen is approximately 3.46 × 10⁻¹⁰ m.\n\nNow, we need to convert the pressure from atm to Pa:\n\n1 atm = 101325 Pa\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Chapman-Enskog equation:\n\nD = (3/16) * (1.38064852 × 10⁻²³ J/K * 298.15 K) / (π * (3.46 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)² * 101325 Pa)\n\nD ≈ 2.12 × 10⁻⁵ m²/s\n\nSo, the diffusivity of oxygen gas in air at 25°C and 1 atm pressure is approximately 2.12 × 10⁻⁵ m²/s."
