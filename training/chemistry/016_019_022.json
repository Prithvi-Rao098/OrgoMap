    "message_2": "When 1 mole of hydrogen gas is adsorbed on a surface, the enthalpy of adsorption is -30 kJ/mol. Since the enthalpy is negative, this means that the process is exothermic, and heat is evolved during the adsorption.\n\nTherefore, the heat evolved when 1 mole of hydrogen gas is adsorbed on a surface is 30 kJ/mol."
