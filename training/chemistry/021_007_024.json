    "message_2": "To calculate the formal charge of nitrogen in the NO3- molecule, we will use the formula:\n\nFormal Charge = (Valence Electrons) - (Non-bonding Electrons) - (1/2 x Bonding Electrons)\n\nFor nitrogen (N) in NO3-, we have:\n\n1. Valence Electrons: Nitrogen belongs to Group 15 (or Group 5A) in the periodic table, so it has 5 valence electrons.\n2. Non-bonding Electrons: In the NO3- molecule, nitrogen is bonded to three oxygen atoms, and there are no lone pairs on the nitrogen atom. Therefore, there are 0 non-bonding electrons.\n3. Bonding Electrons: Each nitrogen-oxygen bond in NO3- is a double bond, which means there are 2 x 3 = 6 bonding electrons.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nFormal Charge of N = (5) - (0) - (1/2 x 6)\nFormal Charge of N = 5 - 0 - 3\nFormal Charge of N = +2\n\nSo, the formal charge of nitrogen in the NO3- molecule is +2."
