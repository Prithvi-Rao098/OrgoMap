    "message_2": "Uranium-238 undergoes a series of radioactive decay processes, ultimately resulting in the formation of a stable isotope of lead, specifically Lead-206 (Pb-206). This decay series is known as the uranium series or the 4n+2 decay chain, and it involves several alpha and beta decays through intermediate isotopes of thorium, radium, radon, polonium, and others before reaching the stable Pb-206."
