Given data that may be used: \n\n- The heat of combustion of methane is -890 kJ/mol.\n- The surface area of the silica gel is 300 m2/g.\n- The loading of methane onto the silica gel is 1.5 mmol/g.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of adsorption of methane onto silica gel, we need to determine the amount of heat released during the adsorption process. We can use the heat of combustion of methane and the loading of methane onto the silica gel to find this value.\n\nFirst, let's convert the loading of methane from mmol/g to mol/g:\n\n1.5 mmol/g * (1 mol / 1000 mmol) = 0.0015 mol/g\n\nNext, we can find the amount of heat released per gram of silica gel during the adsorption process by multiplying the loading of methane (in mol/g) by the heat of combustion of methane:\n\n0.0015 mol/g * (-890 kJ/mol) = -1.335 kJ/g\n\nNow, we need to find the amount of heat released per square meter of silica gel surface area. To do this, we can divide the heat released per gram of silica gel by the surface area of the silica gel:\n\n-1.335 kJ/g / 300 m²/g = -0.00445 kJ/m²\n\nThe enthalpy of adsorption of methane onto silica gel is -0.00445 kJ/m²."
