    "message_1": "What is the new equilibrium constant value if the temperature of a chemical system is increased from 25°C to 35°C, given that the original equilibrium constant (Kc) value is 0.12 at 25°C and the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the reaction is -45 kJ/mol?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Van't Hoff equation, which relates the change in temperature to the change in the equilibrium constant for a reaction:\n\nln(K2/K1) = -ΔH/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nWhere:\n- K1 is the equilibrium constant at the initial temperature (T1)\n- K2 is the equilibrium constant at the final temperature (T2)\n- ΔH is the enthalpy change of the reaction\n- R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\n- T1 and T2 are the initial and final temperatures in Kelvin, respectively\n\nFirst, we need to convert the temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin:\nT1 = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\nT2 = 35°C + 273.15 = 308.15 K\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Van't Hoff equation:\n\nln(K2/0.12) = -(-45,000 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K) * (1/308.15 K - 1/298.15 K)\n\nSolve for K2:\n\nln(K2/0.12) ≈ 2.104\nK2/0.12 = e^2.104\nK2 ≈ 0.12 * e^2.104\nK2 ≈ 0.301\n\nThe new equilibrium constant value at 35°C is approximately 0.301."
