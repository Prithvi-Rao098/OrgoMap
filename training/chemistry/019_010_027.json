    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of 1 mole of ethane, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH_combustion = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nFor the products, we have 2 moles of CO2 and 3 moles of H2O. For the reactants, we have 1 mole of C2H6. The standard enthalpies of formation are given for each substance.\n\nΔH_combustion = [(2 mol CO2 × -393.5 kJ/mol CO2) + (3 mol H2O × -285.8 kJ/mol H2O)] - (1 mol C2H6 × -84.7 kJ/mol C2H6)\n\nΔH_combustion = [(-787 kJ) + (-857.4 kJ)] - (-84.7 kJ)\n\nΔH_combustion = -1644.4 kJ + 84.7 kJ\n\nΔH_combustion = -1559.7 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the combustion of 1 mole of ethane (C2H6) is -1559.7 kJ."
