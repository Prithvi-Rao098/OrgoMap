    "message_2": "The enthalpy change for the combustion of carbon is not relevant to this problem. We only need the enthalpy change for the combustion of hydrogen gas.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the combustion of hydrogen gas is:\n\nH2(g) + 1/2 O2(g) → H2O(g)\n\nThe given enthalpy change for this reaction is -141.8 kJ/mol.\n\nHowever, the chemical equation we want to find the enthalpy change for is:\n\n2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(g)\n\nComparing the two equations, we can see that the second equation is just twice the first equation. Therefore, the enthalpy change for the second equation will be twice the enthalpy change for the first equation.\n\nEnthalpy change for 2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(g) = 2 × (-141.8 kJ/mol) = -283.6 kJ/mol"
