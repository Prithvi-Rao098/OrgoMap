    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the vaporization of 25.0 g of water, we need to first determine the number of moles of water and then use the molar enthalpy of vaporization.\n\n1. Calculate the number of moles of water:\nThe molar mass of water (H2O) is 18.015 g/mol. \n\nmoles of water = mass of water / molar mass of water\nmoles of water = 25.0 g / 18.015 g/mol\nmoles of water ≈ 1.387 moles\n\n2. Calculate the standard enthalpy change:\nStandard enthalpy change = moles of water × molar enthalpy of vaporization\n\nStandard enthalpy change = 1.387 moles × 40.7 kJ/mol\nStandard enthalpy change ≈ 56.4 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the vaporization of 25.0 g of water at 100°C is approximately 56.4 kJ."
