    "message_2": "First, we need to determine the limiting reactant. To do this, we will calculate the moles of each reactant and compare their mole ratios.\n\nMolar mass of CH4 = 12.01 (C) + 4 * 1.01 (H) = 16.05 g/mol\nMoles of CH4 = 12.5 g / 16.05 g/mol = 0.778 moles\n\nMolar mass of O2 = 2 * 16.00 (O) = 32.00 g/mol\nMoles of O2 = 50.0 g / 32.00 g/mol = 1.5625 moles\n\nNow, we will compare the mole ratios of CH4 and O2 to the balanced equation:\n\nCH4 : O2 = 1 : 2\n0.778 moles CH4 : 1.5625 moles O2 = 1 : 2.008\n\nSince the ratio of CH4 to O2 is slightly less than the balanced equation (1 : 2), CH4 is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow, we will calculate the mass of CO2 produced using the stoichiometry of the balanced equation:\n\n1 mole CH4 produces 1 mole CO2\n0.778 moles CH4 will produce 0.778 moles CO2\n\nMolar mass of CO2 = 12.01 (C) + 2 * 16.00 (O) = 44.01 g/mol\nMass of CO2 = 0.778 moles * 44.01 g/mol = 34.23 g\n\nTherefore, 34.23 grams of CO2 will be produced when 12.5 grams of methane reacts with 50.0 grams of oxygen."
