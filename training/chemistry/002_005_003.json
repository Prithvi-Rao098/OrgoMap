    "message_2": "The inorganic compound formed between magnesium and chlorine is magnesium chloride (MgCl2). This compound is an ionic compound, as it is formed through the transfer of electrons between a metal (magnesium) and a non-metal (chlorine). Magnesium loses two electrons to form a Mg2+ cation, while each chlorine atom gains one electron to form two Cl- anions. These ions are then attracted to each other through electrostatic forces, forming the ionic compound magnesium chloride."
