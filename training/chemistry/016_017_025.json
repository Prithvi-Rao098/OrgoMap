    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of methane, we can use the following balanced chemical equation:\n\nCH₄(g) + 2 O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2 H₂O(l)\n\nNow, we can use Hess's Law to calculate the enthalpy change for this reaction:\n\nΔH = Σ ΔHf(products) - Σ ΔHf(reactants)\n\nFor the products, we have 1 mole of CO₂ and 2 moles of H₂O. For the reactants, we have 1 mole of CH₄ and 2 moles of O₂. The enthalpy of formation of O₂ is 0 kJ/mol since it is in its standard state.\n\nΔH = [(1 mol CO₂ × -393.5 kJ/mol CO₂) + (2 mol H₂O × -285.8 kJ/mol H₂O)] - [(1 mol CH₄ × -74.8 kJ/mol CH₄) + (2 mol O₂ × 0 kJ/mol O₂)]\n\nΔH = (-393.5 kJ + (-571.6 kJ)) - (-74.8 kJ)\nΔH = -965.1 kJ + 74.8 kJ\nΔH = -890.3 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we need to find the enthalpy change for 2.5 moles of methane:\n\nΔH_total = ΔH × moles of CH₄\nΔH_total = -890.3 kJ/mol × 2.5 mol\nΔH_total = -2225.75 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change when 2.5 moles of methane gas is completely burned in excess oxygen gas is -2225.75 kJ."
