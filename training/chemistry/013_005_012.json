    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory, which is a widely used method for determining the surface area of porous materials. The BET theory is based on the adsorption of gas molecules onto a solid surface.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of nitrogen gas adsorbed. We can use the ideal gas law for this:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nWhere P is the pressure (1.00 atm), V is the volume (10.0 mL), n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant (0.0821 L atm/mol K), and T is the temperature (77 K).\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for n:\n\nn = PV / RT\n\nn = (1.00 atm) × (10.0 mL) × (1 L / 1000 mL) / (0.0821 L atm/mol K × 77 K)\n\nn ≈ 0.00159 moles\n\nNow that we have the number of moles of nitrogen gas adsorbed, we can find the total number of nitrogen molecules by multiplying the number of moles by Avogadro's number (6.022 × 10^23 molecules/mol):\n\nNumber of N2 molecules = 0.00159 moles × 6.022 × 10^23 molecules/mol ≈ 9.57 × 10^20 molecules\n\nNext, we can calculate the total surface area occupied by the nitrogen molecules by multiplying the number of molecules by the cross-sectional area of a nitrogen molecule (16.2 Å^2):\n\nTotal surface area = (9.57 × 10^20 molecules) × (16.2 Å^2/molecule)\n\nTotal surface area ≈ 1.55 × 10^22 Å^2\n\nFinally, we need to convert the surface area from Å^2 to a more common unit, such as m^2. To do this, we can use the conversion factor 1 Å = 1 × 10^-10 m:\n\nTotal surface area = (1.55 × 10^22 Å^2) × (1 × 10^-10 m/Å)^2\n\nTotal surface area ≈ 1.55 × 10^6 m^2\n\nSo, the surface area of the sample of activated carbon is approximately 1.55 × 10^6 m^2."
