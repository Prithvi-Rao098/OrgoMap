    "message_1": "What is the percentage composition of a gas mixture consisting of propane, butane, and pentane if the gas mixture has a total pressure of 550 mmHg and the individual compounds have partial pressures of 100 mmHg for propane, 200 mmHg for butane, and 250 mmHg for pentane, when analyzed using gas chromatography?",
    "message_2": "To find the percentage composition of the gas mixture, we need to determine the mole fraction of each compound and then convert it to a percentage. The mole fraction of each compound can be found by dividing the partial pressure of the compound by the total pressure of the mixture.\n\n1. Calculate the mole fraction of propane:\nMole fraction of propane = (Partial pressure of propane) / (Total pressure)\nMole fraction of propane = 100 mmHg / 550 mmHg\nMole fraction of propane = 0.1818\n\n2. Calculate the mole fraction of butane:\nMole fraction of butane = (Partial pressure of butane) / (Total pressure)\nMole fraction of butane = 200 mmHg / 550 mmHg\nMole fraction of butane = 0.3636\n\n3. Calculate the mole fraction of pentane:\nMole fraction of pentane = (Partial pressure of pentane) / (Total pressure)\nMole fraction of pentane = 250 mmHg / 550 mmHg\nMole fraction of pentane = 0.4545\n\n4. Convert the mole fractions to percentages:\nPercentage of propane = 0.1818 * 100 = 18.18%\nPercentage of butane = 0.3636 * 100 = 36.36%\nPercentage of pentane = 0.4545 * 100 = 45.45%\n\nSo, the percentage composition of the gas mixture is approximately 18.18% propane, 36.36% butane, and 45.45% pentane."
