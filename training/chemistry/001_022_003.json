    "message_2": "When 3-methyl-1-pentene is subjected to a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement reaction in the presence of concentrated sulfuric acid, the product formed is 2-methyl-2-pentene.\n\nHere is the mechanism for the reaction:\n\n1. Protonation of the alkene: The double bond of 3-methyl-1-pentene reacts with the sulfuric acid (H2SO4), resulting in the formation of a carbocation at the more substituted carbon (C2) due to the stability provided by the methyl group.\n\n   H2C=C(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3 + H2SO4 → [H2C(+)-C(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3] + HSO4-\n\n2. Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement: A 1,2-hydride shift occurs, moving a hydride from the neighboring carbon (C3) to the carbocation at C2. This results in the formation of a new carbocation at C3.\n\n   [H2C(+)-C(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3] → [H3C-C(+)(CH3)-CH-CH2-CH3]\n\n3. Deprotonation: The carbocation formed in step 2 is deprotonated by the bisulfate ion (HSO4-) to form the alkene product, 2-methyl-2-pentene.\n\n   [H3C-C(+)(CH3)-CH-CH2-CH3] + HSO4- → H2C=C(CH3)-CH-CH2-CH3 + H2SO4\n\nThe stereochemistry of the product is determined by the Zaitsev's rule, which states that the more substituted alkene is the major product. In this case, the major product is 2-methyl-2-pentene, as it has more alkyl groups attached to the double bond compared to the alternative product, 3-methyl-1-pentene."
