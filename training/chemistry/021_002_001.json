    "message_2": "In ethene (C2H4), the carbon atoms are connected by a double bond, which consists of one sigma bond and one pi bond. The bond length between the two carbon atoms refers to the distance between their nuclei. Since the distance between the nuclei of the carbon atoms is already given as 1.33 angstroms, there is no need to calculate it further.\n\nTherefore, the bond length between the two carbon atoms in ethene is 1.33 angstroms."
