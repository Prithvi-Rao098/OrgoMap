    "message_2": "Methanol (CH3OH) and ethanol (C2H5OH) are both alcohols, but they have some differences in their physical and chemical properties due to the difference in their molecular structure.\n\nPhysical properties:\n\n1. Molecular weight: Methanol has a lower molecular weight (32 g/mol) compared to ethanol (46 g/mol) because it has one less carbon atom and two less hydrogen atoms.\n\n2. Boiling point: Methanol has a lower boiling point (64.7°C or 148.5°F) than ethanol (78.4°C or 173.1°F) due to the weaker intermolecular forces in methanol.\n\n3. Solubility: Both methanol and ethanol are polar molecules and can form hydrogen bonds, making them highly soluble in water. However, ethanol is slightly less soluble than methanol due to its larger non-polar hydrocarbon chain.\n\nChemical properties:\n\n1. Reactivity: Both methanol and ethanol can undergo similar chemical reactions, such as combustion, oxidation, and esterification. However, ethanol is less reactive than methanol due to the presence of the additional carbon atom and the inductive effect.\n\n2. Toxicity: Methanol is more toxic than ethanol. When ingested, methanol is metabolized in the liver to formaldehyde and then to formic acid, which can cause severe metabolic acidosis, optic nerve damage, and even death. Ethanol, on the other hand, is metabolized to acetaldehyde and then to acetic acid, which is less toxic.\n\nNow, when a phenol group is added to a carbon atom in ethanol, it forms a compound called phenethyl alcohol (C6H5CH2CH2OH). The presence of the phenol group significantly affects the properties of the molecule:\n\n1. Polarity: The phenol group is an aromatic ring, which is less polar than the hydroxyl group in alcohols. This makes phenethyl alcohol less polar than ethanol, affecting its solubility in water.\n\n2. Boiling point: The presence of the phenol group increases the molecular weight and the size of the molecule, leading to stronger London dispersion forces. This results in a higher boiling point for phenethyl alcohol (219-221°C or 426-430°F) compared to ethanol.\n\n3. Reactivity: The presence of the phenol group can affect the reactivity of phenethyl alcohol. The aromatic ring can participate in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions, which are not possible for ethanol. Additionally, the electron-donating effect of the phenol group can influence the acidity of the hydroxyl group, making phenethyl alcohol a weaker acid than ethanol.\n\n4. Odor: Phenethyl alcohol has a pleasant, rose-like odor, which is different from the characteristic odor of ethanol. This property makes phenethyl alcohol useful as a fragrance in cosmetics and perfumes."
