    "message_1": "What is the number of electrons transferred when a solution containing 0.5 moles of CuSO4 is electrolyzed using a current of 2.5 amperes for 2 hours, given that the reduction half-reaction is Cu2+ (aq) + 2e-→ Cu (s)?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of electrons transferred during the electrolysis, we can use Faraday's law of electrolysis. First, we need to find the total charge (in coulombs) passed through the solution during the electrolysis.\n\nTotal charge (Q) = Current (I) × Time (t)\n\nGiven that the current (I) is 2.5 amperes and the time (t) is 2 hours, we can convert the time to seconds:\n\n2 hours × (3600 seconds/hour) = 7200 seconds\n\nNow, we can calculate the total charge:\n\nQ = 2.5 A × 7200 s = 18000 coulombs\n\nNext, we need to find the number of moles of electrons (n) transferred during the electrolysis. We can use Faraday's constant (F), which is approximately 96485 coulombs per mole of electrons:\n\nn = Q / F\nn = 18000 C / 96485 C/mol ≈ 0.1864 moles of electrons\n\nSince the reduction half-reaction involves 2 moles of electrons for every mole of Cu2+ reduced:\n\nCu2+ (aq) + 2e- → Cu (s)\n\nWe can find the number of moles of Cu2+ ions reduced:\n\n0.1864 moles of electrons × (1 mole of Cu2+ / 2 moles of electrons) ≈ 0.0932 moles of Cu2+\n\nNow, we can find the number of electrons transferred during the electrolysis:\n\n0.0932 moles of Cu2+ × 2 moles of electrons/mole of Cu2+ ≈ 0.1864 moles of electrons\n\nTherefore, approximately 0.1864 moles of electrons were transferred during the electrolysis."
