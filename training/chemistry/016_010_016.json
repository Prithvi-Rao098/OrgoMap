    "message_1": "What is the enthalpy change when 5.0 g of NaOH dissolves in 100.0 mL of water at 25 °C? Assume that the specific heat capacity of the solution is equal to the specific heat capacity of water and that the heat capacity of the calorimeter is negligible. The molar mass of NaOH is 40.00 g/mol and the density of water is 1.00 g/mL. Use the following equation to calculate the enthalpy change:\nΔHsoln = qsoln/moles of solute",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the moles of NaOH:\n\nmoles of NaOH = mass of NaOH / molar mass of NaOH\nmoles of NaOH = 5.0 g / 40.00 g/mol\nmoles of NaOH = 0.125 mol\n\nNext, we need to find the heat released or absorbed by the solution (q_soln). We can use the following equation:\n\nq_soln = mcΔT\n\nwhere m is the mass of the solution, c is the specific heat capacity of the solution (which is equal to the specific heat capacity of water), and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nFirst, we need to find the mass of the solution. Since the density of water is 1.00 g/mL, the mass of 100.0 mL of water is 100.0 g. Adding the mass of NaOH, we get:\n\nmass of solution = mass of water + mass of NaOH\nmass of solution = 100.0 g + 5.0 g\nmass of solution = 105.0 g\n\nNow, we need to find the change in temperature (ΔT). Since the problem does not provide the final temperature, we cannot calculate ΔT directly. However, we can use the enthalpy change of dissolution for NaOH, which is -44.51 kJ/mol.\n\nNow we can calculate q_soln:\n\nq_soln = moles of NaOH × ΔH_dissolution\nq_soln = 0.125 mol × (-44.51 kJ/mol)\nq_soln = -5.56 kJ\n\nFinally, we can calculate the enthalpy change (ΔH_soln):\n\nΔH_soln = q_soln / moles of solute\nΔH_soln = -5.56 kJ / 0.125 mol\nΔH_soln = -44.48 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change when 5.0 g of NaOH dissolves in 100.0 mL of water at 25 °C is approximately -44.48 kJ/mol."
