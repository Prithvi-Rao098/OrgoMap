    "message_2": "To determine the structure of Compound X, we need to analyze the NMR spectrum data provided:\n\n1. A singlet at 2.1 ppm with an integration of 3.\n2. A triplet at 3.8 ppm with an integration of 2.\n3. A quartet at 7.2 ppm with an integration of 1.\n\nLet's break down the information:\n\n1. The singlet at 2.1 ppm with an integration of 3 suggests that there is a CH3 group (methyl group) in the molecule. The chemical shift of 2.1 ppm is typical for a methyl group that is not directly attached to an electronegative atom.\n\n2. The triplet at 3.8 ppm with an integration of 2 indicates that there is a CH2 group (methylene group) in the molecule. The chemical shift of 3.8 ppm suggests that this methylene group is adjacent to an electronegative atom, such as oxygen or nitrogen.\n\n3. The quartet at 7.2 ppm with an integration of 1 suggests that there is a CH group (methine group) in the molecule. The chemical shift of 7.2 ppm is typical for a methine group that is part of an aromatic ring.\n\nBased on this information, we can propose the following structure for Compound X:\n\nAn aromatic ring with a CH2 group (methylene) attached to it, which is further connected to a CH3 group (methyl) through an oxygen atom. This structure can be represented as:\n\nAr-CH2-O-CH3\n\nWhere \"Ar\" represents the aromatic ring."
