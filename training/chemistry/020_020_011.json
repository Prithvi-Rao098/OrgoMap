Given that the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the reaction is -50 kJ/mol and the initial concentration of A and B are 0.1 mol/L and 0.2 mol/L respectively.",
    "message_2": "To determine the change in the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the exothermic reaction A + B ⇌ AB when the temperature is increased from 298 K to 350 K, we can use the van't Hoff equation:\n\nln(K2/K1) = -ΔH/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere K1 and K2 are the equilibrium constants at temperatures T1 and T2, ΔH is the enthalpy change, and R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K).\n\nGiven:\nΔH = -50 kJ/mol = -50,000 J/mol\nT1 = 298 K\nT2 = 350 K\n\nWe need to find K1 (the initial equilibrium constant) at 298 K. However, we are not given the initial equilibrium constant. Therefore, we cannot calculate the exact change in Kc. \n\nHowever, we can still determine the general trend of the change in Kc. Since the reaction is exothermic (ΔH < 0), increasing the temperature will shift the equilibrium to the left (towards the reactants) according to Le Chatelier's principle. This means that Kc will decrease when the temperature is increased from 298 K to 350 K."
