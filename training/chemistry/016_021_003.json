    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of polymerization (ΔH) per mole of styrene monomer, we need to determine the number of moles of styrene monomer and then divide the energy released by the number of moles.\n\nFirst, let's find the molar mass of styrene monomer (C8H8). The molar mass of carbon (C) is 12.01 g/mol, and the molar mass of hydrogen (H) is 1.01 g/mol.\n\nMolar mass of styrene = (8 × 12.01) + (8 × 1.01) = 96.08 + 8.08 = 104.16 g/mol\n\nNow, let's find the number of moles of styrene monomer in 10 grams.\n\nNumber of moles = mass / molar mass = 10 g / 104.16 g/mol ≈ 0.096 moles\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy of polymerization (ΔH) per mole of styrene monomer.\n\nΔH = energy released / number of moles = 1195 kJ / 0.096 moles ≈ 12447.92 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy of polymerization of polystyrene is approximately 12,448 kJ/mol."
