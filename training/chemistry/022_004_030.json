    "message_2": "To balance the redox reaction between potassium permanganate (KMnO4) and oxalic acid (H2C2O4) in acidic medium, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Write down the unbalanced equation:\nKMnO4 + H2C2O4 → Mn^2+ + CO2\n\n2. Separate the equation into two half-reactions:\nOxidation half-reaction: H2C2O4 → CO2\nReduction half-reaction: KMnO4 → Mn^2+\n\n3. Balance the atoms in each half-reaction:\nOxidation half-reaction: H2C2O4 → 2 CO2 + 2 H^+\nReduction half-reaction: MnO4^- + 8 H^+ + 5 e^- → Mn^2+ + 4 H2O\n\n4. Balance the electrons in both half-reactions:\nTo balance the electrons, we need to multiply the oxidation half-reaction by 5 and the reduction half-reaction by 2:\n\nOxidation half-reaction: 5 H2C2O4 → 10 CO2 + 10 H^+ + 10 e^-\nReduction half-reaction: 2 MnO4^- + 16 H^+ + 10 e^- → 2 Mn^2+ + 8 H2O\n\n5. Add the two balanced half-reactions together and simplify:\n5 H2C2O4 + 2 MnO4^- + 16 H^+ → 10 CO2 + 10 H^+ + 2 Mn^2+ + 8 H2O\n\nSimplify by canceling out the 10 H^+ on both sides:\n5 H2C2O4 + 2 MnO4^- + 6 H^+ → 10 CO2 + 2 Mn^2+ + 8 H2O\n\n6. Write the balanced redox reaction:\n5 H2C2O4 + 2 KMnO4 + 6 H^+ → 10 CO2 + 2 Mn^2+ + 8 H2O\n\nNote: In the final balanced equation, we replaced MnO4^- with KMnO4, as potassium (K^+) is a spectator ion and does not participate in the redox reaction."
