    "message_2": "To determine the percentage composition of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen in a sample of a new organic compound, we need to perform an elemental analysis. Elemental analysis is a method that provides the relative amounts of each element present in a compound. Here's how we can do it:\n\n1. Obtain a known mass of the sample.\n2. Perform combustion analysis to determine the mass of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen in the sample.\n3. Calculate the percentage composition of each element.\n\nLet's assume we have the following data from the elemental analysis:\n\n- Mass of the sample: 100 mg\n- Mass of carbon obtained: 60 mg\n- Mass of hydrogen obtained: 10 mg\n- Mass of nitrogen obtained: 30 mg\n\nNow, we can calculate the percentage composition of each element:\n\nPercentage of Carbon (C) = (Mass of Carbon / Mass of Sample) × 100\nPercentage of Carbon (C) = (60 mg / 100 mg) × 100 = 60%\n\nPercentage of Hydrogen (H) = (Mass of Hydrogen / Mass of Sample) × 100\nPercentage of Hydrogen (H) = (10 mg / 100 mg) × 100 = 10%\n\nPercentage of Nitrogen (N) = (Mass of Nitrogen / Mass of Sample) × 100\nPercentage of Nitrogen (N) = (30 mg / 100 mg) × 100 = 30%\n\nSo, the percentage composition of the new organic compound is:\n- Carbon: 60%\n- Hydrogen: 10%\n- Nitrogen: 30%"
