    "message_1": "What volume of carbon dioxide gas will be released when 5 grams of calcium carbonate reacts with an excess of hydrochloric acid inside a 1 L container at standard temperature and pressure?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) to produce calcium chloride (CaCl2), water (H2O), and carbon dioxide (CO2):\n\nCaCO3 (s) + 2 HCl (aq) → CaCl2 (aq) + H2O (l) + CO2 (g)\n\nFirst, we need to determine the number of moles of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) that are present in 5 grams. The molar mass of CaCO3 is:\n\n40.08 (Ca) + 12.01 (C) + 3 * 16.00 (O) = 100.09 g/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of moles of CaCO3:\n\nmoles of CaCO3 = mass / molar mass = 5 g / 100.09 g/mol ≈ 0.0499 mol\n\nFrom the balanced chemical equation, we can see that 1 mole of CaCO3 produces 1 mole of CO2. Therefore, the number of moles of CO2 produced is equal to the number of moles of CaCO3:\n\nmoles of CO2 = 0.0499 mol\n\nAt standard temperature and pressure (STP), which is defined as 0°C (273.15 K) and 1 atm, 1 mole of an ideal gas occupies a volume of 22.4 liters. Therefore, we can calculate the volume of CO2 produced:\n\nvolume of CO2 = moles of CO2 * volume per mole at STP = 0.0499 mol * 22.4 L/mol ≈ 1.12 L\n\nSo, approximately 1.12 liters of carbon dioxide gas will be released when 5 grams of calcium carbonate reacts with an excess of hydrochloric acid inside a 1 L container at standard temperature and pressure."
