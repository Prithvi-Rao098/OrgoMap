    "message_2": "In NaClO3, the oxidation state of sodium (Na) is +1, and the oxidation state of oxygen (O) is -2. Let's denote the oxidation state of chlorine (Cl) as x. \n\nThe overall charge of the compound NaClO3 is neutral (0). Therefore, the sum of the oxidation states of all the elements in the compound must equal zero. \n\nSo, we have:\n\n(+1) + x + 3(-2) = 0\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx - 6 = -1\n\nx = +5\n\nThe oxidation state of chlorine in NaClO3 is +5."
