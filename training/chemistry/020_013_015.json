    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Ka) for the dissociation of acetic acid (CH3COOH) in water, we need to first write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nCH3COOH (aq) + H2O (l) ⇌ CH3COO- (aq) + H3O+ (aq)\n\nNow, we can set up the equilibrium expression for the reaction:\n\nKa = [CH3COO-][H3O+] / [CH3COOH]\n\nWe are given the initial concentration of acetic acid ([CH3COOH]0) as 0.1 M and the equilibrium concentration of the conjugate base ([CH3COO-]) as 0.02 M. Since acetic acid is a weak acid, we can assume that the amount of dissociation is small compared to the initial concentration. Therefore, we can write the equilibrium concentrations as follows:\n\n[CH3COOH] = [CH3COOH]0 - [CH3COO-] ≈ 0.1 M - 0.02 M = 0.08 M\n[CH3COO-] = [H3O+] = 0.02 M (since the reaction produces equal amounts of CH3COO- and H3O+)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Ka expression:\n\nKa = (0.02)(0.02) / (0.08)\nKa = 0.0004 / 0.08\nKa = 0.005\n\nThe equilibrium constant (Ka) for the dissociation of acetic acid in water at 25°C is approximately 0.005."
