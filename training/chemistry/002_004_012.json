    "message_2": "The given dissociation constant (Ka) is not relevant for HCl in this case, as HCl is a strong acid and dissociates completely in water. Therefore, we can directly calculate the pH of the solution using the concentration of HCl.\n\nThe pH of a solution is calculated using the formula:\n\npH = -log10[H+]\n\nSince HCl is a strong acid and dissociates completely, the concentration of H+ ions will be equal to the concentration of HCl. In this case, the concentration of HCl is 0.1 M.\n\npH = -log10(0.1)\npH = -(-1)\npH = 1\n\nThe pH of the 0.1 M HCl solution is 1."
