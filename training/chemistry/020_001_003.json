If the initial concentration of N2 is 0.1 M and the initial concentration of H2 is 0.2 M, what is the concentration of NH3 at equilibrium?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table method. First, let's set up the ICE table:\n\n```\n          N2(g)   +   3H2(g)   ⇌   2NH3(g)\nInitial:   0.1M        0.2M         0M\nChange:   -x          -3x          +2x\nEquilibrium: 0.1-x     0.2-3x       2x\n```\n\nNow, we can write the expression for the equilibrium constant, Kc:\n\nKc = [NH3]^2 / ([N2] * [H2]^3)\n\nGiven Kc = 6.0 x 10^2, we can substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the expression:\n\n6.0 x 10^2 = (2x)^2 / ((0.1 - x) * (0.2 - 3x)^3)\n\nNow, we need to solve for x. Since this is a complex equation, we can make an assumption that x is small compared to the initial concentrations of N2 and H2. This means that 0.1 - x ≈ 0.1 and 0.2 - 3x ≈ 0.2. This simplifies the equation to:\n\n6.0 x 10^2 = (2x)^2 / (0.1 * 0.2^3)\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n(2x)^2 = 6.0 x 10^2 * 0.1 * 0.2^3\n(2x)^2 = 6.0 x 10^2 * 0.1 * 0.008\n(2x)^2 = 4.8\n2x = sqrt(4.8)\n2x = 2.19\nx = 1.095\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can find the concentration of NH3 at equilibrium:\n\n[NH3] = 2x = 2 * 1.095 = 2.19 M\n\nSo, the concentration of NH3 at equilibrium is 2.19 M."
