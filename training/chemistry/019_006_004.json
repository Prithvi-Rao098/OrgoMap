    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction, we can use the expression:\n\nKc = [N2O4] / [NO2]^2\n\nFirst, we need to determine the change in concentration for both NO2 and N2O4. Since the stoichiometry of the reaction is 2 moles of NO2 for every 1 mole of N2O4, the change in concentration for NO2 is twice that of N2O4.\n\nInitial concentration of NO2 = 0.25 M\nEquilibrium concentration of NO2 = 0.15 M\nChange in concentration of NO2 = 0.25 - 0.15 = 0.10 M\n\nInitial concentration of N2O4 = 0 M (since it's not given, we assume it's 0)\nEquilibrium concentration of N2O4 = 0.10 M\nChange in concentration of N2O4 = 0.10 - 0 = 0.10 M\n\nNow, we can plug these equilibrium concentrations into the Kc expression:\n\nKc = [N2O4] / [NO2]^2\nKc = (0.10) / (0.15)^2\nKc = 0.10 / 0.0225\nKc ≈ 4.44\n\nThe equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction at 298 K is approximately 4.44."
