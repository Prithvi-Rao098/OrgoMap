    "message_2": "In this redox reaction, we can identify the oxidation states of each element as follows:\n\n1. Cu (Copper):\nIn its elemental form, the oxidation state of Cu is 0.\n\n2. HNO3 (Nitric acid):\nFor H, the oxidation state is +1.\nFor O, the oxidation state is -2.\nFor N, we can determine its oxidation state using the formula: oxidation state of N = x\n(+1) + x + 3(-2) = 0\nx - 6 = 0\nx = +5\nSo, the oxidation state of N in HNO3 is +5.\n\n3. Cu(NO3)2 (Copper(II) nitrate):\nFor Cu, the oxidation state is +2 (as indicated by the Roman numeral II).\nFor N and O in the nitrate ion (NO3-), the oxidation states are the same as in HNO3: N is +5 and O is -2.\n\n4. NO2 (Nitrogen dioxide):\nFor O, the oxidation state is -2.\nFor N, we can determine its oxidation state using the formula: oxidation state of N = x\nx + 2(-2) = 0\nx - 4 = 0\nx = +4\nSo, the oxidation state of N in NO2 is +4.\n\n5. H2O (Water):\nFor H, the oxidation state is +1.\nFor O, the oxidation state is -2.\n\nIn summary, the oxidation states in the redox reaction are:\nCu: 0\nHNO3: H(+1), N(+5), O(-2)\nCu(NO3)2: Cu(+2), N(+5), O(-2)\nNO2: N(+4), O(-2)\nH2O: H(+1), O(-2)"
