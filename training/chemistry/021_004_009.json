    "message_2": "The hybridization of the carbon atom in the molecule C2H2 (acetylene) is sp. Each carbon atom in C2H2 forms two sigma bonds (one with another carbon atom and one with a hydrogen atom) and two pi bonds (with the other carbon atom). The formation of two sigma bonds requires two hybrid orbitals, which are formed by the combination of one s orbital and one p orbital, resulting in sp hybridization."
