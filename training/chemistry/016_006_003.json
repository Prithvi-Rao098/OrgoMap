    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of heat released during the dissolution of sodium hydroxide and then use that to calculate the final temperature of the solution.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of moles of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in 5.00 g.\n\nThe molar mass of NaOH = 22.99 g/mol (Na) + 15.999 g/mol (O) + 1.007 g/mol (H) = 39.996 g/mol\n\nNumber of moles of NaOH = mass / molar mass = 5.00 g / 39.996 g/mol ≈ 0.125 mol\n\nNow, let's calculate the heat released during the dissolution of NaOH.\n\nq = moles × enthalpy of dissolution = 0.125 mol × -44.51 kJ/mol = -5.564 kJ\n\nSince the heat is released, the value is negative. Now, we need to find the heat capacity of the water.\n\nThe specific heat capacity of water is 4.18 J/g°C. Since we have 100 mL of water, and the density of water is approximately 1 g/mL, we have 100 g of water.\n\nHeat capacity of water = mass × specific heat capacity = 100 g × 4.18 J/g°C = 418 J/°C\n\nNow, let's convert the heat released during the dissolution of NaOH to Joules.\n\nq = -5.564 kJ × 1000 J/kJ = -5564 J\n\nNow, we can find the change in temperature of the water.\n\nΔT = q / heat capacity of water = -5564 J / 418 J/°C ≈ -13.3°C\n\nSince the initial temperature of the water is 25°C, the final temperature will be:\n\nFinal temperature = initial temperature + ΔT = 25°C - 13.3°C ≈ 11.7°C\n\nSo, the final temperature of the water after adding 5.00 g of solid sodium hydroxide is approximately 11.7°C."
