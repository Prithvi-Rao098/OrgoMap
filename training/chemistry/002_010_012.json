    "message_2": "To calculate the density of the titanium (III) nitrate sample, we can use the formula:\n\nDensity = Mass / Volume\n\nGiven the mass of the sample is 34.6 g and the volume is 25.0 mL, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nDensity = 34.6 g / 25.0 mL = 1.384 g/mL\n\nNow, we need to convert the density from g/mL to kg/m³. To do this, we can use the following conversion factors:\n\n1 g = 0.001 kg\n1 mL = 0.000001 m³\n\nSo, we can convert the density to kg/m³:\n\n1.384 g/mL * (0.001 kg / 1 g) * (1 mL / 0.000001 m³) = 1384 kg/m³\n\nTherefore, the density of the titanium (III) nitrate sample is 1.384 g/mL or 1384 kg/m³."
