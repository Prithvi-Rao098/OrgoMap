    "message_2": "To identify the functional groups present in a given organic compound using spectroscopic techniques, you can use the following methods:\n\n1. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy: IR spectroscopy measures the absorption of infrared light by a molecule, which causes vibrations in the chemical bonds. Different functional groups absorb infrared light at specific wavelengths, allowing you to identify them based on their characteristic absorption peaks.\n\n2. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy: NMR spectroscopy uses the interaction of radiofrequency radiation with the nuclei of atoms in a magnetic field. The resulting spectra provide information about the chemical environment of the nuclei, which can help identify functional groups. Proton NMR (1H NMR) and Carbon-13 NMR (13C NMR) are the most commonly used techniques for organic compounds.\n\n3. Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) Spectroscopy: UV-Vis spectroscopy measures the absorption of ultraviolet and visible light by a molecule. Functional groups with conjugated systems (alternating single and double bonds) or chromophores (groups that absorb light) can be identified using this technique.\n\n4. Mass Spectrometry (MS): MS is a technique that measures the mass-to-charge ratio of ions. It can provide information about the molecular weight of a compound and its fragmentation pattern, which can help identify functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.\n\nTo identify the functional groups in a given organic compound, you should:\n\n1. Obtain the IR, NMR, UV-Vis, and MS spectra of the compound.\n2. Analyze the IR spectrum for characteristic absorption peaks that correspond to specific functional groups. For example, a broad peak around 3300 cm-1 indicates the presence of an O-H group, while a sharp peak around 1700 cm-1 indicates a C=O group.\n3. Examine the NMR spectra for characteristic chemical shifts and coupling patterns that can help identify functional groups. For example, a singlet around 9-10 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum indicates an aldehyde, while a peak around 170 ppm in the 13C NMR spectrum indicates a carbonyl group.\n4. Analyze the UV-Vis spectrum for any absorption peaks that can be attributed to chromophores or conjugated systems.\n5. Evaluate the MS data to determine the molecular weight and fragmentation pattern of the compound, which can provide clues about the functional groups and overall structure.\n\nBy combining the information obtained from these spectroscopic techniques, you can identify the functional groups present in the given organic compound."
