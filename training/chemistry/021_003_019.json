    "message_2": "To predict the bond angle in a molecule of sulfur dioxide (SO2) using the VSEPR theory, we first need to determine the electron geometry and molecular geometry of the molecule.\n\n1. Determine the central atom: In SO2, sulfur (S) is the central atom.\n\n2. Count the total number of valence electrons: Sulfur has 6 valence electrons, and each oxygen atom has 6 valence electrons. So, the total number of valence electrons is 6 (S) + 2 * 6 (O) = 18 valence electrons.\n\n3. Determine the electron geometry: To do this, we need to distribute the valence electrons in the molecule. First, we form single bonds between the central atom (S) and the two oxygen atoms (O). This accounts for 4 valence electrons (2 bonds * 2 electrons/bond). The remaining 14 valence electrons are distributed as lone pairs. Sulfur will have one lone pair (2 electrons), and each oxygen atom will have three lone pairs (6 electrons each). This gives us the following electron distribution:\n\nS: 1 lone pair (2 electrons) + 2 single bonds (4 electrons) = 6 electrons\nO: 3 lone pairs (6 electrons) + 1 single bond (2 electrons) = 8 electrons (for each oxygen atom)\n\nThe electron geometry around the central sulfur atom is trigonal planar because there are three electron groups (two single bonds and one lone pair) around it.\n\n4. Determine the molecular geometry: The molecular geometry is determined by the arrangement of the bonded atoms (ignoring the lone pairs). In SO2, the molecular geometry is bent or V-shaped due to the presence of the lone pair on the sulfur atom.\n\n5. Predict the bond angle: In a molecule with trigonal planar electron geometry, the ideal bond angle is 120°. However, in SO2, the presence of the lone pair on the sulfur atom causes a repulsion between the lone pair and the bonding pairs, which pushes the oxygen atoms closer together. As a result, the bond angle in SO2 is slightly less than 120°. Experimental measurements show that the bond angle in SO2 is approximately 119.5°.\n\nIn summary, the electron geometry of SO2 is trigonal planar, and its molecular geometry is bent or V-shaped. The presence of the lone pair on the sulfur atom causes a deviation from the ideal bond angle of 120°, resulting in a bond angle of approximately 119.5°."
