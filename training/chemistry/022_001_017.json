    "message_2": "To balance the given chemical equation, follow these steps:\n\n1. Count the number of atoms of each element on both sides of the equation.\n   Reactants: 1 Fe, 1 H, 1 Cl\n   Products: 1 Fe, 2 H, 3 Cl\n\n2. Identify the element that has an unequal number of atoms on both sides. In this case, it's chlorine (Cl).\n\n3. Adjust the coefficients to balance the number of chlorine atoms. Since there are 3 Cl atoms in FeCl3, we need to multiply HCl by 3 to get 3 Cl atoms on the reactant side.\n\n   Fe + 3HCl → FeCl3 + H2\n\n4. Now, count the number of atoms of each element again.\n   Reactants: 1 Fe, 3 H, 3 Cl\n   Products: 1 Fe, 2 H, 3 Cl\n\n5. Balance the remaining elements. In this case, it's hydrogen (H). Since there are 3 H atoms on the reactant side and 2 H atoms on the product side, we can balance it by multiplying H2 by 1.5 (3/2). However, we should avoid using fractions in balanced chemical equations. So, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to remove the fraction.\n\n   2(Fe + 3HCl) → 2(FeCl3 + 1.5H2)\n\n6. Simplify the equation:\n\n   2Fe + 6HCl → 2FeCl3 + 3H2\n\nThe balanced chemical equation is:\n\n2Fe + 6HCl → 2FeCl3 + 3H2"
