    "message_2": "To determine the formal charge of each atom in the molecule HCOOH (formic acid), we will use the formula:\n\nFormal charge = (Valence electrons) - (Non-bonding electrons) - (1/2 x Bonding electrons)\n\n1. Hydrogen (H): \nValence electrons: 1\nNon-bonding electrons: 0\nBonding electrons: 2 (1 single bond)\nFormal charge of H: 1 - 0 - (1/2 x 2) = 0\n\n2. Carbon (C): \nValence electrons: 4\nNon-bonding electrons: 0\nBonding electrons: 8 (1 single bond to H, 1 single bond to O, and 1 double bond to O)\nFormal charge of C: 4 - 0 - (1/2 x 8) = 0\n\n3. Oxygen (O) with a single bond to C: \nValence electrons: 6\nNon-bonding electrons: 4 (2 lone pairs)\nBonding electrons: 2 (1 single bond to C)\nFormal charge of O: 6 - 4 - (1/2 x 2) = 0\n\n4. Oxygen (O) with a double bond to C: \nValence electrons: 6\nNon-bonding electrons: 4 (2 lone pairs)\nBonding electrons: 4 (1 double bond to C)\nFormal charge of O: 6 - 4 - (1/2 x 4) = 0\n\nIn summary, the formal charges of each atom in the HCOOH molecule are as follows:\nH: 0\nC: 0\nO (single bond): 0\nO (double bond): 0"
