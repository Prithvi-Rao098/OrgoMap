    "message_2": "To find the heat of crystallization of sodium acetate trihydrate, we need to determine the amount of heat released per gram of the substance. \n\nGiven that 10 grams of sodium acetate trihydrate released 125.8 kJ of heat, we can calculate the heat of crystallization as follows:\n\nHeat of crystallization = Heat released / Mass of substance\nHeat of crystallization = 125.8 kJ / 10 g\n\nHeat of crystallization = 12.58 kJ/g\n\nSo, the heat of crystallization of sodium acetate trihydrate is 12.58 kJ/g."
