    "message_2": "In the compound SF6, the central atom is sulfur (S). To determine the hybridization of the central atom, we need to consider the number of electron domains around the sulfur atom.\n\nSulfur has 6 valence electrons, and it forms 6 sigma bonds with the 6 fluorine atoms in SF6. Therefore, there are 6 electron domains around the sulfur atom.\n\nAccording to the VSEPR theory, the hybridization that corresponds to 6 electron domains is sp3d2. So, the hybridization of the central atom (sulfur) in SF6 is sp3d2."
