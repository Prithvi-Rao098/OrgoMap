    "message_2": "The reaction between propyne (CH₃C≡CH) and hydrogen chloride (HCl) is an electrophilic addition reaction. The mechanism involves the following steps:\n\n1. Protonation of the alkyne: The electrophilic hydrogen atom from HCl is attracted to the electron-rich triple bond of propyne. The triple bond acts as a nucleophile and attacks the hydrogen atom, forming a bond with it. This results in the formation of a carbocation intermediate and a chloride ion (Cl⁻).\n\nCH₃C≡CH + HCl → CH₃C≡C⁺H₂ + Cl⁻\n\n2. Attack of the nucleophile: The carbocation intermediate is electron-deficient and positively charged. The chloride ion (Cl⁻), which is a good nucleophile, attacks the carbocation, forming a bond with the carbon atom.\n\nCH₃C≡C⁺H₂ + Cl⁻ → CH₃CClH=CH₂\n\nThe product obtained is 1-chloro-2-propene (also known as 1-chloropropene or allyl chloride), which is a vinyl chloride compound with the molecular formula CH₂=CHCH₂Cl."
