    "message_2": "To determine the theoretical yield of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, we first need to find the limiting reactant in the reaction. The balanced chemical equation for the preparation of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine is:\n\nC6H3ClN2O4 + N2H4 → C6H3N4O4 + HCl\n\nMolar mass of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (C6H3ClN2O4) = 202.55 g/mol\nMolar mass of hydrazine (N2H4) = 32.05 g/mol\nMolar mass of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (C6H3N4O4) = 198.11 g/mol\n\nFirst, convert the mass of each reactant to moles:\n\nmoles of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene = 7 g / 202.55 g/mol = 0.0345 mol\nmoles of hydrazine = 5 g / 32.05 g/mol = 0.1559 mol\n\nNow, compare the mole ratio of the reactants to the balanced equation:\n\nmoles of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene / moles of hydrazine = 0.0345 mol / 0.1559 mol = 0.221\n\nSince the balanced equation has a 1:1 ratio of reactants, 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow, calculate the theoretical yield of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine:\n\nmoles of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine = moles of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene = 0.0345 mol\n\nmass of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine = moles × molar mass = 0.0345 mol × 198.11 g/mol = 6.84 g\n\nThe theoretical yield of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine is 6.84 grams."
