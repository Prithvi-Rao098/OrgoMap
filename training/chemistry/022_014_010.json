    "message_1": "The problem is: \n\nA chemistry student has 10 grams of sodium chloride and 20 grams of silver nitrate. If they react the two together, which compound will be the limiting reactant? How many grams of the excess reactant will be left over? And, what is the maximum amount of silver chloride that can be formed?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to first write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between sodium chloride (NaCl) and silver nitrate (AgNO₃):\n\nNaCl (aq) + AgNO₃ (aq) → AgCl (s) + NaNO₃ (aq)\n\nNow, we need to determine the limiting reactant. To do this, we will compare the moles of each reactant and see which one runs out first.\n\nFirst, we need the molar masses of NaCl and AgNO₃:\nNaCl: Na (22.99 g/mol) + Cl (35.45 g/mol) = 58.44 g/mol\nAgNO₃: Ag (107.87 g/mol) + N (14.01 g/mol) + 3O (3 × 16.00 g/mol) = 169.87 g/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the moles of each reactant:\nmoles of NaCl = 10 g / 58.44 g/mol = 0.171 moles\nmoles of AgNO₃ = 20 g / 169.87 g/mol = 0.118 moles\n\nSince the mole ratio of NaCl to AgNO₃ in the balanced equation is 1:1, we can see that AgNO₃ is the limiting reactant because there are fewer moles of it.\n\nNow, we can calculate the amount of excess reactant (NaCl) left over:\nmoles of NaCl left = 0.171 moles - 0.118 moles = 0.053 moles\ngrams of NaCl left = 0.053 moles × 58.44 g/mol = 3.10 g\n\nFinally, we can calculate the maximum amount of silver chloride (AgCl) that can be formed:\nmoles of AgCl = moles of limiting reactant (AgNO₃) = 0.118 moles\nmass of AgCl = moles of AgCl × molar mass of AgCl\nAgCl: Ag (107.87 g/mol) + Cl (35.45 g/mol) = 143.32 g/mol\nmass of AgCl = 0.118 moles × 143.32 g/mol = 16.91 g\n\nSo, the limiting reactant is silver nitrate (AgNO₃), there will be 3.10 grams of sodium chloride (NaCl) left over, and the maximum amount of silver chloride (AgCl) that can be formed is 16.91 grams."
