    "message_2": "To calculate the specific heat capacity of copper, we can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat absorbed (in joules), m is the mass of the substance (in grams), c is the specific heat capacity (in J/g°C), and ΔT is the change in temperature (in °C).\n\nWe are given the following information:\n\nq = 1500 J\nm = 100 g\nΔT = 20°C\n\nWe need to solve for c:\n\n1500 J = (100 g)(c)(20°C)\n\nNow, we can solve for c:\n\nc = 1500 J / (100 g × 20°C)\nc = 1500 J / 2000 g°C\nc = 0.75 J/g°C\n\nThe specific heat capacity of copper is 0.75 J/g°C."
