    "message_2": "To determine the optimum amount of salicylic acid and acetic anhydride required to produce a desired amount of aspirin with a high yield and purity, you need to consider the stoichiometry of the reaction. The balanced chemical equation for the synthesis of aspirin is:\n\nC7H6O3 (salicylic acid) + C4H6O3 (acetic anhydride) → C9H8O4 (aspirin) + C2H4O2 (acetic acid)\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that one mole of salicylic acid reacts with one mole of acetic anhydride to produce one mole of aspirin.\n\nTo calculate the optimum amount of reactants, you need to know the desired amount of aspirin you want to produce. Let's assume you want to produce 10 grams of aspirin.\n\n1. Calculate the moles of aspirin (C9H8O4) desired:\nMolar mass of aspirin = 180.16 g/mol\nMoles of aspirin = (10 g) / (180.16 g/mol) = 0.0555 mol\n\n2. Calculate the moles of salicylic acid (C7H6O3) and acetic anhydride (C4H6O3) required:\nSince the stoichiometry is 1:1, the moles of salicylic acid and acetic anhydride required are equal to the moles of aspirin desired.\nMoles of salicylic acid = 0.0555 mol\nMoles of acetic anhydride = 0.0555 mol\n\n3. Calculate the mass of salicylic acid and acetic anhydride required:\nMolar mass of salicylic acid = 138.12 g/mol\nMass of salicylic acid = (0.0555 mol) × (138.12 g/mol) = 7.66 g\n\nMolar mass of acetic anhydride = 102.09 g/mol\nMass of acetic anhydride = (0.0555 mol) × (102.09 g/mol) = 5.67 g\n\nSo, the optimum amount of salicylic acid and acetic anhydride required to produce 10 grams of aspirin with a high yield and purity is approximately 7.66 grams of salicylic acid and 5.67 grams of acetic anhydride."
