    "message_2": "To find the concentration of the HCl solution, we can use the titration formula:\n\nM1V1 = M2V2\n\nwhere M1 is the concentration of the HCl solution, V1 is the volume of the HCl solution, M2 is the concentration of the NaOH solution, and V2 is the volume of the NaOH solution.\n\nWe are given:\nV1 = 25 mL\nM2 = 0.1 M\nV2 = 32.85 mL\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula and solve for M1:\n\nM1 * 25 mL = 0.1 M * 32.85 mL\n\nM1 * 25 mL = 3.285 moles\n\nNow, divide both sides by 25 mL to find M1:\n\nM1 = 3.285 moles / 25 mL\n\nM1 = 0.1314 M\n\nSo, the concentration of the HCl solution is approximately 0.1314 M."
