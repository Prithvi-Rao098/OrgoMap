    "message_2": "To calculate the heat of mixing, we first need to determine the heat released during the neutralization reaction between HCl and NaOH. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nHCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H2O(l)\n\nSince both solutions have the same concentration (0.1 M) and volume (100 mL), they will react completely with each other, forming an equal amount of NaCl and water.\n\nThe heat released during the reaction can be calculated using the enthalpy change of the reaction, which is -55.9 kJ/mol for the neutralization of HCl and NaOH. We need to determine the number of moles of HCl and NaOH reacting to find the total heat released.\n\nMoles of HCl = (0.1 mol/L) * (100 mL) * (1 L/1000 mL) = 0.01 mol\nMoles of NaOH = (0.1 mol/L) * (100 mL) * (1 L/1000 mL) = 0.01 mol\n\nSince both moles are equal, the reaction goes to completion. Now, we can calculate the heat released:\n\nHeat released = (0.01 mol) * (-55.9 kJ/mol) = -0.559 kJ\n\nNow, we need to determine the heat absorbed by the resulting solution. The total volume of the solution is 200 mL, and since the density is 1.00 g/mL, the mass of the solution is:\n\nMass of solution = (200 mL) * (1.00 g/mL) = 200 g\n\nAssuming the temperature change is negligible, we can calculate the heat absorbed by the solution using the specific heat capacity:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nWhere q is the heat absorbed, m is the mass of the solution, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the temperature change. Since the temperature change is negligible, ΔT is approximately 0, and the heat absorbed by the solution is also approximately 0.\n\nTherefore, the heat of mixing is approximately equal to the heat released during the neutralization reaction:\n\nHeat of mixing ≈ -0.559 kJ"
