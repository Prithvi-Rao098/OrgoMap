    "message_2": "The frequency of infrared radiation that would induce the greatest change in the dipole moment of a molecule depends on the specific molecule and its vibrational modes. In general, the frequency of the radiation corresponds to the energy difference between the vibrational energy levels of the molecule.\n\nTo determine the frequency that would induce the greatest change in the dipole moment, you would need to analyze the vibrational modes of the molecule and identify the mode with the largest change in the dipole moment. This can be done using group theory and vibrational spectroscopy techniques.\n\nOnce the vibrational mode with the largest change in the dipole moment is identified, you can calculate the frequency of the infrared radiation using the following equation:\n\nν = (1/2π) * √(k/μ)\n\nwhere ν is the frequency, k is the force constant of the bond (which is related to the bond strength), and μ is the reduced mass of the atoms involved in the vibration.\n\nKeep in mind that this is a simplified approach, and more advanced computational methods may be needed for complex molecules."
