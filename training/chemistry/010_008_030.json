    "message_1": "What is the current density in an electrochemical cell that contains a copper electrode with a surface area of 10 cm² and a current of 2 A passing through it for 5 minutes, while the other electrode is made of zinc and has a surface area of 5 cm²? The electrolyte used is a solution of zinc sulfate with a concentration of 0.1 M. The reduction potential for copper is +0.34V and the reduction potential for zinc is -0.76V.",
    "message_2": "Current density is defined as the current per unit area of the electrode. In this case, we are given the current (2 A) and the surface area of the copper electrode (10 cm²). To find the current density, we simply divide the current by the surface area:\n\nCurrent density (J) = Current (I) / Surface area (A)\n\nJ = 2 A / 10 cm²\nJ = 0.2 A/cm²\n\nSo, the current density in the electrochemical cell is 0.2 A/cm²."
