    "message_2": "To find the mass of copper deposited on the electrode, we can use Faraday's law of electrolysis, which states that the mass of a substance deposited or dissolved at an electrode is directly proportional to the amount of charge passed through the electrolyte.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total charge passed through the electrolyte. We can do this using the formula:\n\nCharge (Q) = Current (I) × Time (t)\n\nGiven the current (I) is 2.5 A and the time (t) is 45 minutes, we can convert the time to seconds:\n\nt = 45 minutes × 60 seconds/minute = 2700 seconds\n\nNow, we can calculate the charge:\n\nQ = 2.5 A × 2700 s = 6750 C\n\nNext, we need to find the number of moles of electrons transferred during the electrolysis. We can do this using the Faraday constant (F), which is the charge per mole of electrons:\n\nMoles of electrons (n) = Charge (Q) / Faraday constant (F)\n\nn = 6750 C / 96,485 C/mol ≈ 0.07 mol\n\nThe balanced half-reaction for the reduction of Cu^2+ ions to Cu metal is:\n\nCu^2+ + 2e^- → Cu\n\nFrom the stoichiometry of the reaction, we can see that 2 moles of electrons are required to deposit 1 mole of copper. Therefore, we can find the number of moles of copper deposited (n_Cu) using the moles of electrons (n):\n\nn_Cu = n / 2 ≈ 0.07 mol / 2 ≈ 0.035 mol\n\nFinally, we can find the mass of copper deposited (m_Cu) using the atomic weight of copper (AW_Cu):\n\nm_Cu = n_Cu × AW_Cu\n\nm_Cu = 0.035 mol × 63.54 g/mol ≈ 2.22 g\n\nSo, the mass of copper deposited on the electrode during the electrolysis is approximately 2.22 grams."
