    "message_2": "When benzene is treated with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4), the major product formed is nitrobenzene (C6H5NO2). This reaction is an example of electrophilic aromatic substitution, specifically nitration.\n\nMechanism of the reaction:\n\n1. Formation of the electrophile: The concentrated sulfuric acid protonates the nitric acid, forming nitronium ion (NO2+) as the electrophile.\nHNO3 + H2SO4 -> H3O+ + NO2+ + HSO4-\n\n2. Electrophilic attack: The electrophile, nitronium ion (NO2+), attacks the benzene ring, which is rich in electron density due to the presence of delocalized Ï€ electrons. This results in the formation of a resonance-stabilized carbocation intermediate, where the positive charge is delocalized over three carbon atoms.\n\n3. Deprotonation: A base, usually the bisulfate ion (HSO4-) from the first step, abstracts a proton from the carbocation intermediate, restoring the aromaticity of the benzene ring and forming nitrobenzene as the final product.\n\nOverall reaction: C6H6 + HNO3 -> C6H5NO2 + H2O\n\nIn this reaction, the benzene ring acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic nitronium ion. The product, nitrobenzene, is formed through a series of resonance-stabilized intermediates, and the aromaticity of the benzene ring is preserved throughout the reaction."
