    "message_2": "To determine the bond order of the nitrogen molecule (N2) using molecular orbital theory, we first need to understand the electron configuration of nitrogen and then fill the molecular orbitals accordingly.\n\nNitrogen has an atomic number of 7, which means it has 7 electrons. In a nitrogen molecule (N2), there are two nitrogen atoms, so there are a total of 14 electrons.\n\nMolecular orbitals are formed by the linear combination of atomic orbitals. For nitrogen, the molecular orbitals are filled in the following order: σ1s, σ*1s, σ2s, σ*2s, π2p, π*2p, and σ2p.\n\nNow, let's fill the molecular orbitals with the 14 electrons of N2:\n\n1. σ1s: 2 electrons\n2. σ*1s: 2 electrons\n3. σ2s: 2 electrons\n4. σ*2s: 2 electrons\n5. π2p: 4 electrons (2 in each degenerate orbital)\n6. π*2p: 0 electrons\n7. σ2p: 2 electrons\n\nThe bond order is calculated using the formula:\n\nBond order = (number of electrons in bonding orbitals - number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\n\nFor N2, the bond order is:\n\nBond order = (10 - 4) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3\n\nThe bond order of the nitrogen molecule (N2) is 3. This means that there are three covalent bonds between the two nitrogen atoms in the molecule. A higher bond order generally indicates a stronger bond and greater stability. In the case of N2, the triple bond makes it a very stable and unreactive molecule."
