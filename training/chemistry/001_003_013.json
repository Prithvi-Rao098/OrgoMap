    "message_2": "The given molecule is:\n\n    H    H\n     \\  /\n      C=C\n     /  \\\n    H    OH\n\nTo identify the chiral centers, we need to look for carbon atoms that have four different groups attached to them. In this molecule, there are no carbon atoms with four different groups attached. The carbon with the OH group has two hydrogens attached, and the other carbon in the double bond also has two hydrogens attached. Therefore, there are no chiral centers in this molecule.\n\nSince there are no chiral centers, the molecule cannot be a meso compound. Meso compounds have chiral centers but are still achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n\nAs for drawing the enantiomers, since there are no chiral centers in this molecule, it does not have any enantiomers. The molecule is achiral, meaning it is superimposable on its mirror image."
