    "message_2": "The activity of the enzyme amylase in breaking down starch is affected by temperature, as with most enzymes. Enzymes are proteins that act as biological catalysts, speeding up chemical reactions in living organisms. They have an optimal temperature at which they function most efficiently.\n\nFor amylase, the optimal temperature is typically around 37°C (98.6°F), which is the normal body temperature for humans. At this temperature, the enzyme is most effective in breaking down starch into its constituent sugars.\n\nAs the temperature increases above the optimal temperature, the enzyme's activity starts to decline. This is because the higher temperatures cause the enzyme's structure to denature, or lose its shape, which is essential for its function. Once the enzyme is denatured, it can no longer catalyze the breakdown of starch effectively.\n\nConversely, as the temperature decreases below the optimal temperature, the enzyme's activity also decreases. This is because the lower temperatures slow down the molecular motion, resulting in fewer collisions between the enzyme and its substrate (starch), and thus fewer reactions taking place.\n\nIn summary, the effect of temperature on the activity of the enzyme amylase in breaking down starch follows a bell-shaped curve, with the highest activity at the optimal temperature (around 37°C) and decreasing activity as the temperature moves away from this optimal point."
