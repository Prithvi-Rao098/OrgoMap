    "message_2": "To calculate the heat of formation of methane (CH4), we can use the following reaction:\n\nC (graphite) + 2 H2 (g) → CH4 (g)\n\nWe can use Hess's Law to find the heat of formation of methane. Hess's Law states that the total enthalpy change of a reaction is the same, whether the reaction occurs in one step or several steps. We can use the given standard enthalpies of formation of CO2, H2O, and O2 to create a series of reactions that will ultimately give us the desired reaction.\n\nFirst, let's write down the given standard enthalpies of formation:\n\n1. C (graphite) + O2 (g) → CO2 (g)   ΔHf°(CO2) = -393.5 kJ/mol\n2. H2 (g) + 1/2 O2 (g) → H2O (l)     ΔHf°(H2O) = -285.8 kJ/mol\n3. O2 (g)                             ΔHf°(O2) = 0 kJ/mol (since it's an element in its standard state)\n\nNow, we can manipulate these reactions to get the desired reaction:\n\n1. C (graphite) + O2 (g) → CO2 (g)   ΔH1 = -393.5 kJ/mol\n2. 2 (H2 (g) + 1/2 O2 (g) → H2O (l))  ΔH2 = 2 * (-285.8 kJ/mol) = -571.6 kJ/mol\n3. CO2 (g) + 2 H2O (l) → CH4 (g) + 2 O2 (g) + 2 H2O (l)  ΔH3 = ΔHf°(CH4)\n\nNow, we can add reactions 1, 2, and the reverse of reaction 3:\n\nC (graphite) + O2 (g) + 2 H2 (g) + CO2 (g) + 2 H2O (l) → CO2 (g) + 2 H2O (l) + CH4 (g) + 2 O2 (g) + 2 H2O (l)\n\nSimplifying the reaction, we get:\n\nC (graphite) + 2 H2 (g) → CH4 (g)\n\nNow, we can use Hess's Law to find the heat of formation of methane:\n\nΔHf°(CH4) = ΔH1 + ΔH2 + (-ΔH3)\n\nΔHf°(CH4) = -393.5 kJ/mol - 571.6 kJ/mol + ΔH3\n\nΔH3 = 393.5 kJ/mol + 571.6 kJ/mol\n\nΔH3 = 965.1 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the heat of formation of methane (CH4) is -965.1 kJ/mol."
