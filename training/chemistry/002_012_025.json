    "message_2": "To calculate the bond order and bond length of the N-O bond in nitric oxide (NO) using molecular orbital theory, we first need to determine the molecular orbital configuration of NO.\n\nNitrogen (N) has an atomic number of 7, so it has 7 electrons. Oxygen (O) has an atomic number of 8, so it has 8 electrons. Therefore, the NO molecule has a total of 15 electrons.\n\nThe molecular orbitals for NO can be represented as follows:\n1. σ(1s)\n2. σ*(1s)\n3. σ(2s)\n4. σ*(2s)\n5. σ(2pz)\n6. π(2px) = π(2py)\n7. π*(2px) = π*(2py)\n8. σ*(2pz)\n\nNow, we can fill the molecular orbitals with the 15 electrons, starting from the lowest energy level:\n1. σ(1s) - 2 electrons\n2. σ*(1s) - 2 electrons\n3. σ(2s) - 2 electrons\n4. σ*(2s) - 2 electrons\n5. σ(2pz) - 2 electrons\n6. π(2px) = π(2py) - 4 electrons (2 in each)\n7. π*(2px) = π*(2py) - 1 electron (in π*(2px))\n\nThe bond order can be calculated using the formula:\nBond order = (number of electrons in bonding orbitals - number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\n\nIn this case, there are 10 electrons in bonding orbitals (2 in σ(1s), 2 in σ(2s), 2 in σ(2pz), and 4 in π(2px) and π(2py)) and 5 electrons in antibonding orbitals (2 in σ*(1s), 2 in σ*(2s), and 1 in π*(2px)). So, the bond order is:\n\nBond order = (10 - 5) / 2 = 5 / 2 = 2.5\n\nThe bond order of the N-O bond in nitric oxide (NO) is 2.5.\n\nAs for the bond length, it is experimentally determined and cannot be directly calculated using molecular orbital theory. However, we can infer that a higher bond order generally corresponds to a shorter bond length and a stronger bond. The experimental bond length of the N-O bond in nitric oxide (NO) is approximately 115 picometers (pm)."
