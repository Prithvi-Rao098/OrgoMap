    "message_2": "To calculate the conductivity of a 0.1 M solution of sodium chloride (NaCl) at 25°C, we need to know the molar conductivity of NaCl at this concentration and temperature. Molar conductivity is the conductivity of an electrolyte solution divided by the molar concentration of the electrolyte and is usually expressed in S cm²/mol.\n\nFor NaCl, the molar conductivity at infinite dilution (Λm°) at 25°C is approximately 126.5 S cm²/mol. However, since we are dealing with a 0.1 M solution, we need to use the Kohlrausch's law of independent migration of ions to determine the molar conductivity at this concentration:\n\nΛm = Λm° - K√c\n\nwhere Λm is the molar conductivity at the given concentration (c), Λm° is the molar conductivity at infinite dilution, K is the Kohlrausch constant, and c is the concentration of the solution in mol/L.\n\nThe Kohlrausch constant (K) for NaCl is approximately 1.8 S cm²/mol^1/2. Now, we can plug in the values to calculate the molar conductivity at 0.1 M:\n\nΛm = 126.5 - 1.8√0.1\nΛm ≈ 126.5 - 1.8 × 0.316\nΛm ≈ 125.1 S cm²/mol\n\nNow that we have the molar conductivity, we can calculate the conductivity (κ) of the 0.1 M NaCl solution:\n\nκ = Λm × c\nκ = 125.1 × 0.1\nκ ≈ 12.51 S/m\n\nSo, the conductivity of a 0.1 M solution of sodium chloride at 25°C is approximately 12.51 S/m."
