    "message_1": "What is the new equilibrium position, expressed in terms of the equilibrium constant, when a solution containing 0.1 M of NH3 and 0.2 M of NH4Cl is titrated with HCl to a final concentration of 0.15 M? Calculate the percent decrease in the concentration of NH3 at equilibrium due to the added HCl. (Assume that no volume change occurs.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the reaction between NH3 and HCl, which forms NH4Cl:\n\nNH3 + HCl â†’ NH4+ + Cl-\n\nInitially, we have 0.1 M of NH3 and 0.2 M of NH4Cl. When we titrate the solution with HCl to a final concentration of 0.15 M, we can calculate the moles of HCl added:\n\nmoles of HCl = (0.15 M) * volume of the solution\n\nSince we assume no volume change, we can use the initial volume of the solution (let's call it V) to find the moles of HCl:\n\nmoles of HCl = (0.15 M) * V\n\nNow, we can calculate the moles of NH3 and NH4Cl initially present in the solution:\n\nmoles of NH3 = (0.1 M) * V\nmoles of NH4Cl = (0.2 M) * V\n\nWhen HCl is added, it reacts with NH3 to form NH4Cl. The moles of NH3 will decrease, and the moles of NH4Cl will increase:\n\nmoles of NH3 (final) = (0.1 M) * V - (0.15 M) * V\nmoles of NH4Cl (final) = (0.2 M) * V + (0.15 M) * V\n\nNow, we can calculate the final concentrations of NH3 and NH4Cl:\n\n[NH3] = moles of NH3 (final) / V = -0.05 M\n[NH4Cl] = moles of NH4Cl (final) / V = 0.35 M\n\nSince the final concentration of NH3 is negative, it means that all the NH3 has reacted with HCl, and the final concentration of NH3 is 0 M. The final concentration of NH4Cl is 0.35 M.\n\nNow, we can calculate the percent decrease in the concentration of NH3:\n\nPercent decrease = [(initial concentration - final concentration) / initial concentration] * 100\nPercent decrease = [(0.1 M - 0 M) / 0.1 M] * 100 = 100%\n\nThe concentration of NH3 at equilibrium has decreased by 100% due to the added HCl."
