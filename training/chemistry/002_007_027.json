Write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction, and identify the type of reaction as well as the oxidation state of copper in the reactant and product side of the equation.",
    "message_2": "When aqueous solutions of potassium hydroxide (KOH) and copper(II) chloride (CuCl₂) are mixed, a double displacement reaction occurs, resulting in the formation of copper(II) hydroxide (Cu(OH)₂) and potassium chloride (KCl).\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\n2 KOH (aq) + CuCl₂ (aq) → Cu(OH)₂ (s) + 2 KCl (aq)\n\nType of reaction: Double displacement reaction\n\nOxidation state of copper in the reactant side (CuCl₂): +2\nOxidation state of copper in the product side (Cu(OH)₂): +2\n\nThe oxidation state of copper remains the same on both sides of the equation, indicating that there is no redox reaction occurring in this case."
