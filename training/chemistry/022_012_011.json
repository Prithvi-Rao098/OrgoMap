    "message_2": "To calculate the volume of 0.2 M hydrochloric acid (HCl) required to completely neutralize 25 mL of 0.1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution, we can use the concept of moles and the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nNaOH + HCl → NaCl + H2O\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of NaOH reacts with 1 mole of HCl. \n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of NaOH in the 25 mL solution:\n\nmoles of NaOH = Molarity × Volume\nmoles of NaOH = 0.1 M × 0.025 L (since 25 mL = 0.025 L)\nmoles of NaOH = 0.0025 moles\n\nSince 1 mole of NaOH reacts with 1 mole of HCl, we need 0.0025 moles of HCl to neutralize the NaOH.\n\nNow, we can find the volume of 0.2 M HCl required:\n\nVolume of HCl = moles of HCl / Molarity of HCl\nVolume of HCl = 0.0025 moles / 0.2 M\nVolume of HCl = 0.0125 L\n\nTo convert the volume to milliliters:\n\nVolume of HCl = 0.0125 L × 1000 mL/L\nVolume of HCl = 12.5 mL\n\nSo, 12.5 mL of 0.2 M hydrochloric acid is required to completely neutralize 25 mL of 0.1 M sodium hydroxide solution."
