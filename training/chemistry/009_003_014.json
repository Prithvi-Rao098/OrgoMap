    "message_2": "To calculate the total energy released by the fission of 1 kg of uranium-235, we need to first convert the mass defect into energy using Einstein's famous equation, E=mc^2, where E is energy, m is mass, and c is the speed of light (3.0 x 10^8 m/s).\n\n1. Convert the mass defect from atomic mass units (amu) to kilograms (kg):\n1 amu = 1.66054 x 10^-27 kg\n0.1925 amu = 0.1925 * 1.66054 x 10^-27 kg = 3.199 x 10^-28 kg\n\n2. Calculate the energy released per fission event using E=mc^2:\nE = (3.199 x 10^-28 kg) * (3.0 x 10^8 m/s)^2 = 2.879 x 10^-11 Joules\n\n3. Determine the number of uranium-235 atoms in 1 kg:\n1 kg of uranium-235 = 1000 g\n1 mole of uranium-235 = 235 g\nNumber of moles in 1 kg = 1000 g / 235 g/mol = 4.255 mol\nNumber of atoms in 1 kg = 4.255 mol * Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol) = 2.561 x 10^24 atoms\n\n4. Calculate the total energy released by the fission of 1 kg of uranium-235:\nTotal energy = (2.879 x 10^-11 Joules/fission event) * (2.561 x 10^24 atoms) = 7.377 x 10^13 Joules\n\nThe total energy released by the fission of 1 kg of uranium-235 is approximately 7.377 x 10^13 Joules."
