    "message_1": "How much energy is required to break the bond between two oxygen atoms in a diatomic oxygen molecule (O2) using bond enthalpy?",
    "message_2": "The bond enthalpy, also known as bond dissociation energy, is the energy required to break a chemical bond between two atoms. For a diatomic oxygen molecule (O2), the bond enthalpy is approximately 498 kJ/mol. This means that 498 kJ of energy is required to break the bond between two oxygen atoms in one mole of O2 molecules."
