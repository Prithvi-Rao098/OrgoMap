    "message_2": "As an AI language model, I cannot directly analyze the IR and NMR spectra since I cannot see or process images. However, I can help you interpret the results if you provide me with the key peaks and signals from the IR and NMR spectra. Please provide the relevant information, and I will do my best to help you determine the molecular structure and functional groups of compound X."
