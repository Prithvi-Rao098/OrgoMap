    "message_2": "The reaction quotient (Q) is calculated using the initial concentrations of the reactants and products in the reaction. For the given reaction:\n\n2A + 3B ↔ 4C\n\nThe expression for Q is:\n\nQ = [C]^4 / ([A]^2 * [B]^3)\n\nUsing the initial concentrations provided:\n\n[A] = 0.2 M\n[B] = 1.0 M\n[C] = 0.5 M\n\nPlug these values into the Q expression:\n\nQ = (0.5)^4 / ((0.2)^2 * (1.0)^3)\nQ = (0.0625) / (0.04 * 1)\nQ = 0.0625 / 0.04\nQ = 1.5625\n\nSo, the reaction quotient (Q) for the given reaction at 25°C with the initial concentrations provided is 1.5625."
