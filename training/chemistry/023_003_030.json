    "message_2": "The balanced chemical equation for the synthesis of nylon-6,6 from adipic acid and hexamethylenediamine is:\n\nn HOOC-(CH2)4-COOH + n H2N-(CH2)6-NH2 â†’ [-OC-(CH2)4-COO-(CH2)6-NH-]n + 2n H2O\n\nwhere n represents the number of repeating units in the polymer chain.\n\nTo determine the theoretical yield of the reaction, we need to know the initial amounts of adipic acid and hexamethylenediamine. The theoretical yield is based on the limiting reactant, which is the reactant that will be completely consumed first in the reaction. Once we know the limiting reactant, we can calculate the theoretical yield using stoichiometry."
