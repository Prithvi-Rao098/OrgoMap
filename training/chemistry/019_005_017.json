    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) at standard conditions, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°\n\nwhere ΔH° is the change in enthalpy, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ΔS° is the change in entropy.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin:\n\nT = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\n\nNext, we need to convert the entropy from J/K•mol to kJ/K•mol:\n\nΔS° = -283.3 J/K•mol × (1 kJ / 1000 J) = -0.2833 kJ/K•mol\n\nNow we can plug in the values into the equation:\n\nΔG° = (-1560.8 kJ/mol) - (298.15 K × -0.2833 kJ/K•mol) = -1560.8 kJ/mol + 84.5 kJ/mol = -1476.3 kJ/mol\n\nThe Gibbs free energy change for the combustion of ethane gas in oxygen gas to form carbon dioxide gas and water vapor at a temperature of 25 °C and a pressure of 1 atm is -1476.3 kJ/mol."
