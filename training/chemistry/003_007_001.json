    "message_2": "To find the entropy change when a perfect gas expands, we can use the formula:\n\nΔS = nR * ln(V2/V1)\n\nwhere ΔS is the entropy change, n is the number of moles of the gas, R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), V1 is the initial volume, and V2 is the final volume.\n\nHowever, we don't have the number of moles (n) given in the problem. To find n, we can use the ideal gas law:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nSince we don't have the pressure (P) either, we can't find the exact value of the entropy change. But we can express the entropy change in terms of the unknown variables n and P.\n\nFirst, let's find n from the ideal gas law:\n\nn = PV/RT\n\nNow, let's substitute this expression for n into the entropy change formula:\n\nΔS = (PV/RT) * R * ln(V2/V1)\n\nThe R's cancel out:\n\nΔS = P * (V2 - V1) * ln(V2/V1) / T\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values for V1, V2, and T:\n\nΔS = P * (10 L - 5 L) * ln(10 L / 5 L) / 300 K\n\nΔS = P * 5 L * ln(2) / 300 K\n\nSo, the entropy change depends on the pressure P. If the pressure is given, you can plug it into the equation to find the exact value of ΔS."
