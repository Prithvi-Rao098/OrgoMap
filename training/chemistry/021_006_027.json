    "message_2": "The dipole moment of a carbon dioxide (CO2) molecule is 0 Debye. This is because CO2 is a linear molecule with two polar C=O bonds that are oriented in opposite directions. The individual bond dipoles cancel each other out, resulting in a net dipole moment of zero for the entire molecule."
