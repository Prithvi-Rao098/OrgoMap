    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant (K) of the redox reaction, we first need to determine the standard cell potential (E°cell) for the reaction. \n\nThe given redox reaction is:\n\nFe3+(aq) + SCN-(aq) ⇌ FeSCN2+(aq)\n\nWe can break this reaction into two half-reactions:\n\n1. Fe3+(aq) + e- → Fe2+(aq) (Reduction)\n2. FeSCN2+(aq) → Fe3+(aq) + SCN-(aq) + e- (Oxidation)\n\nThe standard reduction potential for the first half-reaction is given as E°1 = 0.771 V. For the second half-reaction, we need to reverse the given reaction:\n\nFeSCN2+(aq) + e- ⇌ Fe2+(aq) + SCN-(aq) E° = -0.216 V\n\nReversed reaction:\n\nFe2+(aq) + SCN-(aq) ⇌ FeSCN2+(aq) + e- E° = 0.216 V\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard cell potential (E°cell) for the overall reaction by subtracting the standard reduction potential of the second half-reaction (E°2) from the standard reduction potential of the first half-reaction (E°1):\n\nE°cell = E°1 - E°2 = 0.771 V - 0.216 V = 0.555 V\n\nNow, we can use the Nernst equation to calculate the equilibrium constant (K):\n\nE°cell = (RT/nF) * ln(K)\n\nWhere R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin (298 K for standard conditions), n is the number of electrons transferred (1 in this case), and F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol).\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for K:\n\nK = exp(nFE°cell/RT)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nK = exp((1 * 96,485 C/mol * 0.555 V) / (8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K))\n\nK ≈ 1.1 x 10^12\n\nThe equilibrium constant (K) for the given redox reaction at standard conditions is approximately 1.1 x 10^12."
