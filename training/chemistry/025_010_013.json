    "message_1": "What actions can be taken by chemistry departments or instructors to provide students with greater exposure to current research in chemistry and enhance their understanding of the relevance of this research to their own studies and future careers?",
    "message_2": "1. Incorporate current research articles into the curriculum: Instructors can include recent research articles in their course materials and discuss them during lectures. This will help students understand the latest developments in the field and how they relate to their coursework.\n\n2. Invite guest speakers: Chemistry departments can invite researchers and professionals from academia, industry, or government to give talks on their current research projects. This will expose students to a variety of research topics and career paths in chemistry.\n\n3. Organize research seminars and workshops: Departments can organize regular research seminars and workshops where faculty members, postdocs, and graduate students present their research findings. This will provide students with an opportunity to learn about ongoing research projects within their department and interact with researchers.\n\n4. Encourage undergraduate research: Instructors can encourage students to participate in undergraduate research projects, either as part of their coursework or as independent research. This hands-on experience will help students develop research skills and gain a deeper understanding of the research process.\n\n5. Collaborate with other departments and institutions: Chemistry departments can collaborate with other departments within their institution or with other institutions to organize joint research seminars, workshops, or conferences. This will expose students to interdisciplinary research and broaden their understanding of the field.\n\n6. Promote research internships and fellowships: Departments can promote research internships and fellowships available to students, both within their institution and externally. This will provide students with opportunities to gain research experience and develop professional connections.\n\n7. Develop research-based courses: Instructors can develop courses that focus on current research topics in chemistry. These courses can include a combination of lectures, discussions, and hands-on laboratory work, allowing students to explore the research topic in depth.\n\n8. Utilize online resources: Instructors can incorporate online resources, such as research databases, podcasts, and webinars, into their courses to expose students to current research and developments in the field.\n\n9. Encourage participation in conferences and symposia: Departments can encourage students to attend and present their research at local, national, and international conferences and symposia. This will provide students with an opportunity to network with other researchers and learn about the latest research findings in their field.\n\n10. Foster a research culture: Chemistry departments can foster a research culture by emphasizing the importance of research in the field, highlighting the achievements of faculty and students, and providing resources and support for students interested in pursuing research opportunities."
