    "message_2": "The minimum temperature required for a deuterium-tritium (D-T) nuclear fusion reaction to occur is approximately 100 million Kelvin (100 MK or 100 million degrees Celsius). This high temperature is necessary to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged deuterium and tritium nuclei, allowing them to come close enough for the strong nuclear force to bind them together.\n\nThe core temperature of the sun is estimated to be around 15 million Kelvin (15 MK or 15 million degrees Celsius). This is significantly lower than the temperature required for D-T fusion. The sun primarily undergoes proton-proton chain reactions, which have a lower temperature threshold for fusion compared to D-T reactions."
