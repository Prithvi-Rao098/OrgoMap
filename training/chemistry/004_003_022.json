    "message_2": "To identify the unknown compound with a molecular formula of C12H22O3, we will analyze the key mass spectrometry peaks and their fragmentation patterns. Mass spectrometry provides information about the molecular weight of the compound and its fragments, which can help us deduce the structure of the compound.\n\nFirst, let's consider the molecular ion peak (M+). This peak represents the intact molecule and its mass should correspond to the molecular weight of the compound. In this case, the molecular ion peak should be at m/z = 214 (12 x 12 for carbon, 22 x 1 for hydrogen, and 3 x 16 for oxygen).\n\nNext, we will look for significant fragment peaks that can provide information about the structure of the compound. Common fragmentation patterns in mass spectrometry include the cleavage of carbon-carbon bonds, loss of functional groups, and rearrangement reactions.\n\n1. Loss of a neutral molecule: A common fragmentation pattern is the loss of a neutral molecule, such as water (H2O, 18 Da) or methanol (CH3OH, 32 Da). If we observe a peak at m/z = 196 (214 - 18), it would suggest the presence of a hydroxyl group in the compound. Similarly, a peak at m/z = 182 (214 - 32) would indicate the presence of a methoxy group.\n\n2. Cleavage of carbon-carbon bonds: Fragmentation of carbon-carbon bonds can result in the formation of smaller fragments, which can provide information about the connectivity of the carbon atoms in the molecule. For example, if we observe a peak at m/z = 57, it could indicate the presence of a propyl group (C3H7) in the compound.\n\n3. Rearrangement reactions: Some compounds undergo rearrangement reactions during mass spectrometry analysis, which can provide information about the structure of the compound. For example, the McLafferty rearrangement is a common reaction observed for carbonyl-containing compounds, where a hydrogen atom is transferred to the carbonyl oxygen, resulting in the cleavage of the carbon-carbon bond adjacent to the carbonyl group. If we observe a peak corresponding to the McLafferty rearrangement, it would suggest the presence of a carbonyl group in the compound.\n\nBy analyzing the key mass spectrometry peaks and their fragmentation patterns, we can deduce the structure of the unknown compound. For example, if we observe peaks corresponding to the loss of water and the presence of a propyl group, we could propose a structure such as 2-propyl-1,4-dihydroxybutane-1,4-dione. Further analysis of the fragmentation patterns and comparison with reference spectra would be necessary to confirm the identity of the compound."
