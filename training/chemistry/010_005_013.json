    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (K) for the given electrochemical reaction, we need to first determine the standard reduction potentials (E°) for the half-reactions involved. The half-reactions are:\n\n1. Fe3+(aq) + e- → Fe2+(aq) with E°1 = +0.77 V\n2. H2(g) → 2H+(aq) + 2e- with E°2 = 0 V (since it's the standard hydrogen electrode)\n\nNow, we can calculate the overall cell potential (E°cell) for the reaction by adding the standard reduction potentials of the half-reactions:\n\nE°cell = E°1 - E°2 = 0.77 V - 0 V = 0.77 V\n\nSince the reaction involves 2 electrons (n = 2), we can use the Nernst equation to find the equilibrium constant (K):\n\nE°cell = (RT/nF) * ln(K)\n\nWhere R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin (25°C = 298.15 K), n is the number of electrons transferred (2), and F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol).\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for K:\n\nK = exp(nF * E°cell / RT)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nK = exp(2 * 96485 * 0.77 / (8.314 * 298.15))\n\nK ≈ 1.1 × 10^11\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant for the given electrochemical reaction at 25°C is approximately 1.1 × 10^11."
