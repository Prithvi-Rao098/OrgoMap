    "message_1": "Calculate the heat of adsorption of hydrogen gas on a platinum surface given the initial temperature of the system is 298 K and the final temperature is 330 K. The mass of the platinum surface used is 5 grams, and the amount of hydrogen adsorbed is 0.01 moles. Assume the heat capacity of the system is constant at 25 J/K.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the heat of adsorption, we can use the formula:\n\nq = n * C * ΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat of adsorption, n is the amount of hydrogen adsorbed (in moles), C is the heat capacity of the system (in J/K), and ΔT is the change in temperature (in K).\n\nFirst, let's find the change in temperature:\n\nΔT = T_final - T_initial\nΔT = 330 K - 298 K\nΔT = 32 K\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nq = (0.01 moles) * (25 J/K) * (32 K)\n\nq = 0.01 * 25 * 32\nq = 8 J\n\nSo, the heat of adsorption of hydrogen gas on the platinum surface is 8 Joules."
