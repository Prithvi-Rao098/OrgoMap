Given that the specific heat capacity of the resulting solution is 4.18 J/g°C, and its temperature increases from 25.0°C to 30.0°C. The molar mass of KCl is 74.55 g/mol, and the enthalpy of hydration of K+ and Cl- ions is -716 and -364 kJ/mol, respectively.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to calculate the moles of KCl dissolved:\n\nmoles of KCl = mass / molar mass\nmoles of KCl = 5.00 g / 74.55 g/mol = 0.0671 mol\n\nNext, we need to calculate the enthalpy change for the dissolution of KCl:\n\nΔH_dissolution = moles of KCl * (enthalpy of hydration of K+ + enthalpy of hydration of Cl-)\nΔH_dissolution = 0.0671 mol * (-716 kJ/mol + (-364 kJ/mol))\nΔH_dissolution = 0.0671 mol * (-1080 kJ/mol)\nΔH_dissolution = -72.5 kJ\n\nNow, we need to calculate the heat absorbed by the solution:\n\nq_solution = mass of solution * specific heat capacity * ΔT\nq_solution = (100 g + 5 g) * 4.18 J/g°C * (30.0°C - 25.0°C)\nq_solution = 105 g * 4.18 J/g°C * 5.0°C\nq_solution = 2194.5 J = 2.1945 kJ\n\nSince the heat absorbed by the solution is equal to the heat released by the dissolution process, we can write:\n\nΔH_dissolution = -q_solution\nΔH_dissolution = -(-2.1945 kJ)\nΔH_dissolution = 2.1945 kJ\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy change for the dissolution of 5.00 g of potassium chloride in 100 mL of water is 2.1945 kJ."
