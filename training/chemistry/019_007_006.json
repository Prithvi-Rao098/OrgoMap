    "message_1": "A student wants to calculate the reaction quotient, Q, for the following chemical reaction at 298 K:\n\n2H2(g) + O2(g) ⇌ 2H2O(g)\n\nIf the partial pressures of H2, O2, and H2O are 0.25 atm, 0.15 atm, and 0.1 atm, respectively, what is the value of Q?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the reaction quotient, Q, we need to use the expression for Q based on the balanced chemical equation:\n\nQ = [H2O]^2 / ([H2]^2 * [O2])\n\nHere, the concentrations are given in terms of partial pressures. So, we can plug in the given values:\n\nQ = (0.1)^2 / ((0.25)^2 * (0.15))\n\nQ = 0.01 / (0.0625 * 0.15)\n\nQ = 0.01 / 0.009375\n\nQ ≈ 1.067\n\nTherefore, the value of Q for this reaction at 298 K with the given partial pressures is approximately 1.067."
