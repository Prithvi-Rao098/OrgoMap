    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the fusion of 25 grams of ice at -10°C to liquid water at 20°C, we need to consider three steps:\n\n1. Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C\n2. Melting the ice at 0°C\n3. Heating the liquid water from 0°C to 20°C\n\nStep 1: Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C\nq1 = mass x specific heat capacity of ice x temperature change\nq1 = 25 g x 2.09 J/g°C x (0 - (-10))°C\nq1 = 25 g x 2.09 J/g°C x 10°C\nq1 = 523.5 J\n\nStep 2: Melting the ice at 0°C\nFirst, we need to find the moles of ice:\nMolar mass of water = 18.015 g/mol\nmoles of ice = 25 g / 18.015 g/mol = 1.387 mol\n\nq2 = moles x enthalpy of fusion\nq2 = 1.387 mol x 6.01 kJ/mol\nq2 = 8.338 kJ = 8338 J (converted to Joules)\n\nStep 3: Heating the liquid water from 0°C to 20°C\nq3 = mass x specific heat capacity of water x temperature change\nq3 = 25 g x 4.18 J/g°C x (20 - 0)°C\nq3 = 25 g x 4.18 J/g°C x 20°C\nq3 = 2090 J\n\nNow, we add the enthalpy changes for all three steps to find the total standard enthalpy change:\n\nTotal enthalpy change = q1 + q2 + q3\nTotal enthalpy change = 523.5 J + 8338 J + 2090 J\nTotal enthalpy change = 10951.5 J\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the fusion of 25 grams of ice at -10°C to liquid water at 20°C is 10,951.5 J."
