    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kb) for the dissociation of ammonia (NH3) in water, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nNH3(aq) + H2O(l) â‡Œ NH4+(aq) + OH-(aq)\n\nNext, we need to find the equilibrium concentrations of all the species involved in the reaction. We are given the initial concentration of NH3 (0.02 M) and the equilibrium concentration of NH4+ (0.004 M). Since the reaction produces an equal amount of NH4+ and OH-, the equilibrium concentration of OH- is also 0.004 M. The change in the concentration of NH3 is equal to the concentration of NH4+ produced, so the equilibrium concentration of NH3 is 0.02 - 0.004 = 0.016 M.\n\nNow we can use the expression for the equilibrium constant (Kb) for the reaction:\n\nKb = [NH4+][OH-] / [NH3]\n\nPlugging in the equilibrium concentrations:\n\nKb = (0.004)(0.004) / (0.016)\nKb = 0.000016 / 0.016\nKb = 1.0 x 10^-3\n\nThe equilibrium constant (Kb) for the dissociation of ammonia (NH3) in water is 1.0 x 10^-3."
