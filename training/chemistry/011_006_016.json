    "message_2": "Ethylene (C2H4) is a symmetric molecule with a planar structure. Due to its symmetry, the dipole moments of the C-H bonds cancel each other out, resulting in a net dipole moment of zero. This is true for both ab initio calculations and experimental measurements. In other words, ethylene is a nonpolar molecule with no significant dipole moment."
