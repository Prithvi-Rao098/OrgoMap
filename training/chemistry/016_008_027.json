    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat energy required to melt the ice, we need to first determine the number of moles of ice and then use the enthalpy of fusion to find the energy.\n\n1. Calculate the number of moles of ice:\nThe molecular weight of water (H2O) is 18.015 g/mol. \n\nmoles of ice = mass of ice / molecular weight of water\nmoles of ice = 15 g / 18.015 g/mol\nmoles of ice ≈ 0.833 mol\n\n2. Calculate the heat energy required to melt the ice:\nWe can use the enthalpy of fusion (ΔHfus) to find the energy required to melt the ice.\n\nq = moles of ice × ΔHfus\nq = 0.833 mol × 6.01 kJ/mol\nq ≈ 5.01 kJ\n\nTherefore, the amount of heat energy required to melt 15 grams of ice at 0°C is approximately 5.01 kJ."
