    "message_2": "In secular equilibrium, the activity of radon-222 (Rn-222) is equal to the activity of uranium-238 (U-238). The activity (A) of a radioactive substance is given by the equation:\n\nA = λ * N\n\nwhere λ is the decay constant and N is the number of atoms of the substance.\n\nThe decay constant λ can be calculated using the half-life (T) of the substance:\n\nλ = ln(2) / T\n\nThe half-life of U-238 is 4.468 × 10^9 years, and the half-life of Rn-222 is 3.823 days. To make the calculations consistent, we need to convert the half-life of Rn-222 to years:\n\n3.823 days * (1 year / 365.25 days) ≈ 0.01047 years\n\nNow, we can calculate the decay constants for U-238 and Rn-222:\n\nλ(U-238) = ln(2) / (4.468 × 10^9 years) ≈ 1.54 × 10^(-10) year^(-1)\nλ(Rn-222) = ln(2) / 0.01047 years ≈ 0.066 year^(-1)\n\nSince the activity of Rn-222 is given as 3.5 Bq, we can calculate the number of Rn-222 atoms in the sample:\n\n3.5 Bq = 0.066 year^(-1) * N(Rn-222)\nN(Rn-222) ≈ 3.5 Bq / 0.066 year^(-1) ≈ 53 atoms\n\nNow, we can use the secular equilibrium condition (A(U-238) = A(Rn-222)) to find the number of U-238 atoms:\n\nA(U-238) = 1.54 × 10^(-10) year^(-1) * N(U-238)\n3.5 Bq = 1.54 × 10^(-10) year^(-1) * 5.0 × 10^23 atoms\n\nSolving for N(U-238):\n\nN(U-238) ≈ 3.5 Bq / (1.54 × 10^(-10) year^(-1)) ≈ 2.27 × 10^22 atoms\n\nSo, there are approximately 2.27 × 10^22 atoms of uranium-238 in the sample. Since we assumed secular equilibrium, the number of radon-222 atoms is the same:\n\nN(Rn-222) ≈ 2.27 × 10^22 atoms"
