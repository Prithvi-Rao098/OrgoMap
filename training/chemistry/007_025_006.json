    "message_2": "To isolate and identify the active compounds in natural products with potential medicinal use, we can follow a systematic approach that involves several steps:\n\n1. Selection of plant material: Choose the plant species based on traditional knowledge, ethnopharmacological information, or scientific literature that suggests potential medicinal properties for treating the specific disease or condition.\n\n2. Extraction: Harvest the plant material and subject it to extraction using suitable solvents, such as water, ethanol, or methanol. This process will yield crude extracts containing a mixture of compounds.\n\n3. Fractionation: Separate the crude extract into different fractions using techniques like liquid-liquid partitioning, column chromatography, or preparative thin-layer chromatography. This step helps to narrow down the active compounds by separating them based on their polarity or other chemical properties.\n\n4. Biological screening: Test the crude extract and its fractions for their biological activity against the specific disease or condition using in vitro (cell-based) or in vivo (animal) models. This step helps to identify the most active fraction(s) that warrant further investigation.\n\n5. Isolation of active compounds: Further purify the active fraction(s) using advanced chromatographic techniques, such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or flash chromatography, to isolate the individual active compounds.\n\n6. Structural elucidation: Determine the chemical structure of the isolated active compounds using spectroscopic techniques, such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, mass spectrometry (MS), and infrared (IR) spectroscopy. Comparing the obtained data with known compounds in databases can help identify the compound or confirm its novelty.\n\n7. Confirmation of biological activity: Test the isolated active compounds for their biological activity against the specific disease or condition using in vitro or in vivo models. This step confirms that the identified compounds are responsible for the observed activity in the crude extract or fractions.\n\n8. Further studies: Once the active compounds are identified and their structures are elucidated, additional studies can be performed to understand their mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and potential for drug development.\n\nBy following this systematic approach, chemists can isolate and identify the active compounds in natural products with potential medicinal use for treating specific diseases or conditions."
