    "message_1": "What mass of sodium chloride (NaCl) is required to react completely with 20.0 mL of a 0.10 M silver nitrate (AgNO3) solution, according to the following balanced chemical equation?\n\n2 NaCl + AgNO3 → 2 AgCl + NaNO3\n\nAssuming that the density of the silver nitrate solution is 1.00 g/mL, what mass of NaCl in grams is needed to completely react with the silver nitrate solution?",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the moles of AgNO3 in the 20.0 mL solution.\n\nmoles of AgNO3 = (volume of solution) x (concentration of AgNO3)\nmoles of AgNO3 = (20.0 mL) x (0.10 mol/L)\n\nSince 1 L = 1000 mL, we need to convert the volume to liters:\n20.0 mL = 0.020 L\n\nmoles of AgNO3 = (0.020 L) x (0.10 mol/L) = 0.0020 mol\n\nNow, we can use the stoichiometry of the balanced chemical equation to find the moles of NaCl required to react with the AgNO3:\n\n2 NaCl + AgNO3 → 2 AgCl + NaNO3\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 2 moles of NaCl react with 1 mole of AgNO3. Therefore, we can set up a proportion to find the moles of NaCl:\n\nmoles of NaCl / moles of AgNO3 = 2 / 1\nmoles of NaCl / 0.0020 mol = 2 / 1\n\nmoles of NaCl = 0.0020 mol x 2 = 0.0040 mol\n\nFinally, we can convert moles of NaCl to grams using the molar mass of NaCl (58.44 g/mol):\n\nmass of NaCl = (moles of NaCl) x (molar mass of NaCl)\nmass of NaCl = (0.0040 mol) x (58.44 g/mol) = 0.23376 g\n\nTherefore, 0.23376 grams of NaCl are needed to completely react with the 20.0 mL of 0.10 M AgNO3 solution."
