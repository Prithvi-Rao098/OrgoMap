    "message_2": "To determine the purity of a sample of acetaminophen using the melting point determination method, you will need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Obtain a sample of acetaminophen from the local pharmacy.\n\n2. Find the literature value for the melting point of pure acetaminophen. The melting point of pure acetaminophen is typically around 169-170.5°C.\n\n3. Set up a melting point apparatus, such as a Thiele tube or a digital melting point apparatus.\n\n4. Crush the acetaminophen sample into a fine powder and load it into a capillary tube.\n\n5. Place the capillary tube containing the sample in the melting point apparatus and heat it gradually.\n\n6. Observe the temperature at which the sample starts to melt and the temperature at which it completely melts. Record these temperatures as the melting point range.\n\n7. Compare the observed melting point range to the literature value for pure acetaminophen.\n\nIf the observed melting point range is close to the literature value and has a narrow range (less than 1-2°C difference), the sample is likely to be of high purity. If the observed melting point range is significantly lower than the literature value or has a broader range, it indicates that the sample may contain impurities.\n\nPlease note that this method provides an estimation of the purity of the sample and is not an exact measurement. Other methods, such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or gas chromatography (GC), can provide more accurate purity measurements."
