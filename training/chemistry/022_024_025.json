    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n\nwhere pH is the desired pH, pKa is the negative logarithm of the acid dissociation constant (Ka), [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base, and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid.\n\nFirst, we need to find the pKa of acetic acid:\n\npKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.8 x 10^-5) = 4.74\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\n5.0 = 4.74 + log([A-]/[0.1])\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for [A-]:\n\nlog([A-]/[0.1]) = 5.0 - 4.74 = 0.26\n[A-]/[0.1] = 10^0.26 ≈ 1.82\n[A-] ≈ 1.82 * 0.1 = 0.182 M\n\nNow, we need to find the moles of the conjugate base (acetate ion, CH3COO-) needed to achieve this concentration:\n\nmoles of CH3COO- = (0.182 M) * (0.250 L) = 0.0455 moles\n\nSince NaOH reacts with acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio, we need 0.0455 moles of NaOH to achieve the desired pH. Now, we can find the volume of 0.5 M NaOH needed:\n\nvolume of NaOH = moles of NaOH / concentration of NaOH\nvolume of NaOH = 0.0455 moles / 0.5 M = 0.091 L\n\nTherefore, 0.091 L (or 91 mL) of 0.5 M NaOH should be added to the buffer solution to raise the pH to 5.0."
