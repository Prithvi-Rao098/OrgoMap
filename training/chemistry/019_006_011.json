    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction, we first need to write the expression for Kc. For the reaction:\n\nA(s) + 2B(g) ⇌ 3C(g)\n\nThe Kc expression is:\n\nKc = [C]^3 / [B]^2\n\nSince A is a solid, it is not included in the Kc expression.\n\nNow, we are given the equilibrium concentrations of B and C:\n\n[B] = 0.10 M\n[C] = 0.15 M\n\nPlug these values into the Kc expression:\n\nKc = (0.15)^3 / (0.10)^2\n\nKc = (0.003375) / (0.01)\n\nKc = 0.3375\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction at 25°C is 0.3375."
