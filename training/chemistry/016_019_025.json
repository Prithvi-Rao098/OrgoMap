The standard enthalpy of formation of nitrogen gas is 0 kJ/mol.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the adsorption of nitrogen gas onto activated charcoal, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates the change in pressure to the change in enthalpy and temperature. The equation is as follows:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔH/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nIn this case, we have the initial pressure (P1) as 1 atm, the final pressure (P2) as 0.5 atm, and the temperature (T1 and T2) as 298 K. The gas constant (R) is 8.314 J/mol*K. Since the process occurs at constant temperature, T1 = T2, and the equation simplifies to:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔH/R * (1/T - 1/T)\n\nln(0.5) = -ΔH / (8.314 J/mol*K)\n\nNow, we can solve for ΔH:\n\nΔH = -8.314 J/mol*K * ln(0.5)\nΔH ≈ 5774 J/mol\n\nSince we have 2 moles of nitrogen gas, the total enthalpy change for the adsorption process is:\n\nTotal ΔH = 2 * 5774 J/mol\nTotal ΔH ≈ 11548 J\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy change when 2 moles of nitrogen gas are adsorbed onto the surface of activated charcoal at a temperature of 298 K is approximately 11.548 kJ."
