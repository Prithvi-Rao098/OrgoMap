    "message_2": "To prepare 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline from aniline and chlorine gas, you can follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Nitration of aniline\n1.1. Protect the amino group of aniline by acetylation.\n- Dissolve aniline in glacial acetic acid.\n- Add acetic anhydride to the solution and stir it for some time.\n- The reaction will produce N-acetylaniline and acetic acid.\n\n1.2. Nitrate the N-acetylaniline.\n- Dissolve N-acetylaniline in a mixture of glacial acetic acid and concentrated sulfuric acid.\n- Cool the solution in an ice bath.\n- Slowly add a mixture of concentrated nitric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid to the cooled solution while stirring.\n- The reaction will produce p-nitro-N-acetylaniline.\n\n1.3. Hydrolyze the N-acetyl group.\n- Add the p-nitro-N-acetylaniline to an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide.\n- Heat the solution to hydrolyze the N-acetyl group.\n- The reaction will produce p-nitroaniline and sodium acetate.\n\nStep 2: Chlorination of p-nitroaniline\n2.1. Dissolve p-nitroaniline in a suitable solvent, such as glacial acetic acid or acetonitrile.\n\n2.2. Cool the solution in an ice bath to minimize side reactions.\n\n2.3. Slowly bubble chlorine gas through the cooled solution while stirring. The chlorine gas will react with the p-nitroaniline to form 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline.\n\n2.4. Monitor the reaction progress using thin-layer chromatography (TLC) or another analytical technique to ensure complete conversion of p-nitroaniline to 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline.\n\nStep 3: Isolation and purification of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline\n3.1. Filter the reaction mixture to remove any solid impurities.\n\n3.2. Evaporate the solvent under reduced pressure to obtain crude 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline.\n\n3.3. Recrystallize the crude product from a suitable solvent, such as ethanol or water, to obtain pure 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline.\n\n3.4. Dry the purified product and characterize it using various analytical techniques, such as melting point determination, infrared spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, to confirm its identity and purity."
