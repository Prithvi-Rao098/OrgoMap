The reduction potential of Cu2+(aq) + 2e- → Cu(s) is +0.34 V, and the reduction potential of Ag+(aq) + e- → Ag(s) is +0.80 V. Assume the temperature is 25°C and one-unit charge is exchanged.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the rate of the electrochemical reaction, we first need to determine the overall cell potential (E_cell) and the number of electrons transferred (n) in the reaction.\n\nThe overall cell potential can be calculated using the Nernst equation:\n\nE_cell = E_cathode - E_anode\n\nSince Ag+ has a higher reduction potential (+0.80 V) than Cu2+ (+0.34 V), Ag+ will be reduced at the cathode and Cu will be oxidized at the anode. Therefore:\n\nE_cell = 0.80 V - 0.34 V = 0.46 V\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of electrons transferred (n) in the reaction. The balanced half-reactions are:\n\nCu(s) → Cu2+(aq) + 2e- (anode)\nAg+(aq) + e- → Ag(s) (cathode)\n\nThe overall balanced reaction is:\n\nCu(s) + 2Ag+(aq) → Cu2+(aq) + 2Ag(s)\n\nFrom the balanced reaction, we can see that 2 moles of electrons are transferred for every mole of Cu oxidized and 1 mole of electrons is transferred for every mole of Ag reduced. Since one-unit charge is exchanged, we will consider n = 1 for this problem.\n\nNow, we can calculate the rate of the electrochemical reaction using the current density (0.500 A/m²) and the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol):\n\nrate = (current density) / (n * Faraday constant)\nrate = (0.500 A/m²) / (1 * 96,485 C/mol) = 5.18 x 10^-6 mol/m²·s\n\nThe rate of the electrochemical reaction in the electrolytic cell is 5.18 x 10^-6 mol/m²·s."
