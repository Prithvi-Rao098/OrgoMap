    "message_1": "Determine the structure of an unknown organic compound using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, given the following information: \n- The compound has a molecular formula of C6H12O2 \n- The NMR spectrum shows signals at 1.2 ppm (triplet), 2.3 ppm (quartet), and 3.7 ppm (doublet).",
    "message_2": "To determine the structure of the unknown organic compound, we will analyze the given information and use the NMR spectroscopy data.\n\n1. Molecular formula: C6H12O2\nThis formula suggests that the compound may contain an ester, ether, or alcohol functional group, as well as some alkyl groups.\n\n2. NMR spectrum signals:\n- 1.2 ppm (triplet): This signal is characteristic of a methyl group (CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (CH2). The triplet splitting pattern indicates that the CH3 group is next to a carbon with two hydrogens (n+1 rule).\n- 2.3 ppm (quartet): This signal is characteristic of a methylene group (CH2) adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O) or an oxygen atom. The quartet splitting pattern indicates that the CH2 group is next to a carbon with three hydrogens (n+1 rule).\n- 3.7 ppm (doublet): This signal is characteristic of a methylene group (CH2) adjacent to an oxygen atom, such as in ethers or esters. The doublet splitting pattern indicates that the CH2 group is next to a carbon with one hydrogen (n+1 rule).\n\nBased on the molecular formula and the NMR data, we can propose the following structure for the unknown compound:\n\nCH3CH2COOCH2CH2CH3\n\nThis structure is consistent with the molecular formula C6H12O2 and the NMR signals. The compound is an ester, specifically ethyl propionate."
