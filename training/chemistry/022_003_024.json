    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to first find the moles of HCl and NaOH in the solutions, then determine the moles of H+ and OH- ions remaining after the reaction, and finally calculate the pH of the resulting solution.\n\n1. Calculate the moles of HCl and NaOH:\nmoles of HCl = volume (L) × concentration (M)\nmoles of HCl = 0.050 L × 0.1 M = 0.005 moles\n\nmoles of NaOH = volume (L) × concentration (M)\nmoles of NaOH = 0.100 L × 0.05 M = 0.005 moles\n\n2. Determine the moles of H+ and OH- ions remaining after the reaction:\nSince the moles of HCl and NaOH are equal, they will completely react with each other, forming water and a salt (NaCl). There will be no excess H+ or OH- ions.\n\nHCl + NaOH → H2O + NaCl\n\n3. Calculate the pH of the resulting solution:\nSince there are no excess H+ or OH- ions, the resulting solution is neutral, with a pH of 7."
