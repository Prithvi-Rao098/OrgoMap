    "message_2": "To determine the structural formula of the carboxylic acid, we first need to find its molecular formula based on its molecular weight. \n\nThe molecular weight of a carboxylic acid can be represented as:\n\nMolecular weight = 12n + 32 + 2n + 16 + 1\nwhere n is the number of carbon atoms in the carboxylic acid.\n\nGiven the molecular weight of 118 g/mol, we can set up the equation:\n\n118 = 12n + 32 + 2n + 16 + 1\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n118 = 14n + 49\n\nSubtracting 49 from both sides:\n\n69 = 14n\n\nDividing by 14:\n\nn ≈ 4.93\n\nSince the number of carbon atoms must be a whole number, we can round n to 5.\n\nNow that we know there are 5 carbon atoms in the carboxylic acid, we can determine its molecular formula:\n\nC5H(2×5)+2O2\nC5H12O2\n\nThe structural formula of the carboxylic acid is:\n\nCH3(CH2)3COOH\n\nThis carboxylic acid is called pentanoic acid or valeric acid. When it reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst, it forms an ester with a fruity smell."
