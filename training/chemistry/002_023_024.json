    "message_2": "The conductivity of an inorganic compound is directly related to the concentration of its ions in a solution. When the concentration of an inorganic compound in a solution increases, the number of ions available to carry charge also increases, which in turn increases the conductivity of the solution.\n\nIn general, the conductivity of a solution is proportional to the concentration of ions present. This relationship can be represented by the equation:\n\nConductivity (κ) = Concentration (C) × Molar conductivity (Λ)\n\nHere, the molar conductivity (Λ) is a constant that depends on the specific inorganic compound and the temperature of the solution.\n\nAs the concentration of the inorganic compound increases, the number of ions in the solution increases, leading to a higher conductivity. Conversely, as the concentration decreases, the number of ions decreases, resulting in lower conductivity. However, it is important to note that this relationship may not be linear at very high or very low concentrations due to factors such as ion pairing or the formation of complexes.\n\nIn summary, changing the concentration of an inorganic compound in a solution will have a direct effect on its conductivity, with higher concentrations leading to increased conductivity and lower concentrations leading to decreased conductivity."
