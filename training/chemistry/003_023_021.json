    "message_2": "To calculate the energy change of the reaction, we need to use the balanced chemical equation and Hess's Law. The balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane is:\n\nCH₄(g) + 2O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nNow, we can use Hess's Law, which states that the energy change of a reaction is equal to the sum of the energy changes of the products minus the sum of the energy changes of the reactants. In this case, we have:\n\nΔH = [1 mol CO₂ × (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 mol H₂O × (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [1 mol CH₄ × (-890.4 kJ/mol)]\n\nFirst, we need to convert the 2.0 g of methane to moles. The molar mass of methane (CH₄) is 12.01 g/mol (C) + 4 × 1.01 g/mol (H) = 16.05 g/mol. So, we have:\n\n2.0 g CH₄ × (1 mol CH₄ / 16.05 g CH₄) = 0.1247 mol CH₄\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy change for the reaction:\n\nΔH = [0.1247 mol CH₄ × (1 mol CO₂ × (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 mol H₂O × (-285.8 kJ/mol))] - [0.1247 mol CH₄ × (-890.4 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH = [0.1247 mol CH₄ × (-393.5 kJ/mol - 2 × 285.8 kJ/mol)] - [0.1247 mol CH₄ × (-890.4 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH = [0.1247 mol CH₄ × (-965.1 kJ/mol)] - [0.1247 mol CH₄ × (-890.4 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH = -120.3 kJ + 111.1 kJ\n\nΔH = -9.2 kJ\n\nThe energy change of the reaction is -9.2 kJ. Since the value is negative, the reaction is exothermic, meaning it releases energy in the form of heat."
