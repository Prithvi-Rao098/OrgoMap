    "message_2": "A phase diagram is a graphical representation of the equilibrium conditions between different phases of a substance, such as solid, liquid, and gas. In this case, we have information about the triple point, critical point, and normal boiling point of the substance.\n\nTriple point: 2 atm and 50°C\nCritical point: 70 atm and 400°C\nNormal boiling point: 100°C (at 1 atm pressure)\n\nTo calculate the boiling point at 1.2 atm pressure, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates the vapor pressure of a substance at different temperatures. The equation is:\n\nln(P2/P1) = (ΔHvap/R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2)\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization, and R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K).\n\nWe know the normal boiling point (100°C or 373.15 K) and its corresponding pressure (1 atm or 101.325 kPa). We want to find the boiling point at 1.2 atm (121.59 kPa). We can rearrange the equation to solve for T2:\n\n1/T2 = 1/T1 - (R/ΔHvap) * ln(P2/P1)\n\nHowever, we don't have the value for ΔHvap. A common approximation for substances with similar properties to water is to use ΔHvap = 40 kJ/mol. This is just an estimation, and the actual value may vary for different substances.\n\nUsing this approximation, we can plug in the values:\n\n1/T2 = 1/373.15 - (8.314/40000) * ln(121.59/101.325)\n\n1/T2 ≈ 0.002681 - 0.000207\nT2 ≈ 1/0.002474\n\nT2 ≈ 404.1 K\n\nSo, the boiling point at 1.2 atm pressure is approximately 404.1 K or 131°C. Keep in mind that this is an estimation based on the approximation for ΔHvap. The actual boiling point may be different depending on the specific substance and its properties."
