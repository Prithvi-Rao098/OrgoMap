The density of water is 1.00 g/mL and the specific heat capacity of the solution is 4.18 J/g°C. The molar mass of ammonium chloride is 53.49 g/mol.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change of solution, we first need to find the heat absorbed or released by the solution (q). We can do this using the formula:\n\nq = mass × specific heat capacity × change in temperature\n\nThe mass of the solution is the sum of the mass of ammonium chloride and the mass of water. Since the density of water is 1.00 g/mL, the mass of 50.0 mL of water is 50.0 g. Therefore, the mass of the solution is:\n\nmass_solution = mass_NH4Cl + mass_water = 5.00 g + 50.0 g = 55.0 g\n\nThe change in temperature is given as -4.21°C (since the temperature decreases). Now we can calculate the heat absorbed or released by the solution:\n\nq = (55.0 g) × (4.18 J/g°C) × (-4.21°C) = -966.729 J\n\nSince the temperature of the solution decreases, the heat is released, and the enthalpy change (ΔH) is positive. Therefore, ΔH = +966.729 J.\n\nNow we need to find the moles of ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) dissolved:\n\nmoles_NH4Cl = mass_NH4Cl / molar_mass_NH4Cl = 5.00 g / 53.49 g/mol = 0.0935 mol\n\nFinally, we can calculate the enthalpy change of solution per mole of NH4Cl:\n\nΔH_solution = ΔH / moles_NH4Cl = 966.729 J / 0.0935 mol = 10334.5 J/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change of solution for ammonium chloride is approximately 10.3 kJ/mol."
