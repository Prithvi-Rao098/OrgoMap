    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of methane gas (CH4) at constant pressure, we can use Hess's Law, which states that the enthalpy change for a reaction is the same whether it occurs in one step or several steps. We can use the standard enthalpies of formation for the reactants and products to determine the enthalpy change for the reaction.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane is:\n\nCH4 (g) + 2 O2 (g) → CO2 (g) + 2 H2O (l)\n\nThe enthalpy change for the reaction (ΔH) can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nΔH = Σ [ΔHf(products)] - Σ [ΔHf(reactants)]\n\nwhere ΔHf represents the standard enthalpy of formation.\n\nFor the products:\n1 mol of CO2: -393.5 kJ/mol\n2 mol of H2O: 2 * -285.8 kJ/mol = -571.6 kJ/mol\n\nFor the reactants:\n1 mol of CH4: -74.8 kJ/mol\n2 mol of O2: 2 * 0 kJ/mol = 0 kJ/mol (The standard enthalpy of formation for an element in its standard state is zero.)\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nΔH = [(-393.5) + (-571.6)] - [(-74.8) + (0)]\nΔH = (-965.1) - (-74.8)\nΔH = -890.3 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change for the combustion of methane gas (CH4) at constant pressure is -890.3 kJ/mol."
