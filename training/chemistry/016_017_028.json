    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of oxidation of methane gas, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the complete combustion of methane:\n\n$CH_4 + 2O_2 \\rightarrow CO_2 + 2H_2O$\n\nNext, we will use Hess's Law, which states that the enthalpy change of a reaction is equal to the sum of the enthalpy changes of formation of the products minus the sum of the enthalpy changes of formation of the reactants.\n\nΔH_reaction = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nWe are given the standard enthalpy of formation of $CH_4$ (-74.8 kJ/mol) and $H_2O$ (-285.8 kJ/mol). The standard enthalpy of formation of $O_2$ is 0 kJ/mol, as it is in its elemental form. The standard enthalpy of formation of $CO_2$ is -393.5 kJ/mol.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the equation:\n\nΔH_reaction = [1 × (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 × (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [1 × (-74.8 kJ/mol) + 2 × 0 kJ/mol]\n\nΔH_reaction = (-393.5 - 571.6) - (-74.8)\n\nΔH_reaction = -965.1 + 74.8\n\nΔH_reaction = -890.3 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy of oxidation of methane gas when it is burned completely in the presence of excess oxygen gas is -890.3 kJ/mol."
