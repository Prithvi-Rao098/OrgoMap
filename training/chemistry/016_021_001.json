    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the polymerization of 30 grams of polystyrene, we first need to determine the number of moles of polystyrene involved. We can do this using the molecular weight of polystyrene (104.1 g/mol).\n\nNumber of moles = mass / molecular weight\nNumber of moles = 30 g / 104.1 g/mol = 0.288 moles\n\nNow that we have the number of moles, we can calculate the enthalpy change using the heat of polymerization (-124 kJ/mol).\n\nEnthalpy change = heat of polymerization × number of moles\nEnthalpy change = -124 kJ/mol × 0.288 moles = -35.7 kJ\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy change for the polymerization of 30 grams of polystyrene is -35.7 kJ."
