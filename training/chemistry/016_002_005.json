    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction of burning 1 mole of methane using Hess's Law, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane:\n\nCH₄(g) + 2 O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2 H₂O(l)\n\nNow, we can use Hess's Law to find the enthalpy change for this reaction. Hess's Law states that the enthalpy change for a reaction is equal to the sum of the enthalpy changes for the formation of the products minus the sum of the enthalpy changes for the formation of the reactants.\n\nΔH(reaction) = Σ ΔH(products) - Σ ΔH(reactants)\n\nIn this case, the enthalpy change for the reaction is:\n\nΔH(reaction) = [1 × ΔH(CO₂) + 2 × ΔH(H₂O)] - [1 × ΔH(CH₄) + 2 × ΔH(O₂)]\n\nSince the enthalpy of formation for O₂ is zero (it is in its standard state), the equation becomes:\n\nΔH(reaction) = [1 × ΔH(CO₂) + 2 × ΔH(H₂O)] - [1 × ΔH(CH₄)]\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values for the enthalpy of formation:\n\nΔH(reaction) = [1 × (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 × (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [1 × (-74.8 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH(reaction) = (-393.5 - 2 × 285.8 + 74.8) kJ/mol\n\nΔH(reaction) = (-393.5 - 571.6 + 74.8) kJ/mol\n\nΔH(reaction) = -890.3 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy change for the reaction of burning 1 mole of methane is -890.3 kJ/mol."
