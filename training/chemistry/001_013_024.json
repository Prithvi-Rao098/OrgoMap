    "message_2": "Pyridine is an aromatic nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compound. Its aromaticity is similar to that of benzene, as both molecules satisfy Hückel's rule, which states that a compound is aromatic if it has a planar, cyclic structure with 4n+2 π electrons (where n is an integer). \n\nIn pyridine, there are six π electrons, which is the same as in benzene. The difference between the two compounds lies in the presence of a nitrogen atom in pyridine, which replaces one of the carbon atoms in the benzene ring. This nitrogen atom contributes one electron to the π system, while the other two electrons are involved in a lone pair that is not part of the aromatic system. The nitrogen atom in pyridine is sp2 hybridized, and the molecule maintains its planar structure, which is essential for aromaticity.\n\nIn summary, both pyridine and benzene are aromatic compounds with six π electrons, but pyridine contains a nitrogen atom in its ring structure, which differentiates it from benzene."
