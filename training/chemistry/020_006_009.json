    "message_1": "What is the new equilibrium constant for the reaction when the temperature is increased from 25°C to 50°C, if the initial equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction 2NOCl(g) ⇌ 2NO(g) + Cl2(g) is 2.50 × 10^-3 at 25°C and the enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the reaction is +92.7 kJ/mol?",
    "message_2": "To find the new equilibrium constant (Kc') at the increased temperature, we can use the van't Hoff equation:\n\nln(Kc'/Kc) = -ΔH° * (1/T' - 1/T) / R\n\nwhere Kc is the initial equilibrium constant (2.50 × 10^-3), ΔH° is the enthalpy change (+92.7 kJ/mol), T and T' are the initial and final temperatures in Kelvin (298K and 323K, respectively), and R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the enthalpy change from kJ/mol to J/mol:\n\nΔH° = 92.7 kJ/mol * (1000 J/1 kJ) = 92700 J/mol\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the van't Hoff equation:\n\nln(Kc'/Kc) = -92700 * (1/323 - 1/298) / 8.314\n\nln(Kc'/2.50 × 10^-3) = 16.56\n\nNow, we can solve for Kc':\n\nKc' = 2.50 × 10^-3 * e^16.56 = 2.50 × 10^-3 * 1.17 × 10^7 = 29.25\n\nThe new equilibrium constant (Kc') for the reaction at 50°C is approximately 29.25."
