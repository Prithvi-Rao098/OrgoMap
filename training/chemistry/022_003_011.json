    "message_2": "The balanced chemical equation for the reaction between hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is:\n\nHCl (aq) + NaOH (aq) → NaCl (aq) + H2O (l)\n\nThe products formed in this reaction are sodium chloride (NaCl) in aqueous state and water (H2O) in liquid state.\n\nTo calculate the amount of water formed when 50 ml of 0.1 M HCl is completely reacted with 50 ml of 0.1 M NaOH, we can use the concept of moles.\n\nMoles of HCl = (Volume of HCl in L) × (Molarity of HCl) = (50 ml × 0.001 L/ml) × 0.1 M = 0.005 moles\nMoles of NaOH = (Volume of NaOH in L) × (Molarity of NaOH) = (50 ml × 0.001 L/ml) × 0.1 M = 0.005 moles\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, the moles of water formed will be equal to the moles of the limiting reactant. In this case, both HCl and NaOH have the same moles, so either can be considered the limiting reactant.\n\nMoles of water formed = 0.005 moles"
