    "message_2": "To find the maximum amount of work that can be obtained from this reaction, we first need to determine the limiting reactant. In this case, we have:\n\n4 moles H2 x (1 mole O2 / 2 moles H2) = 2 moles O2\n2 moles O2 x (2 moles H2 / 1 mole O2) = 4 moles H2\n\nSince both reactants are present in the stoichiometric ratio, neither is the limiting reactant. Therefore, the reaction will proceed to completion.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total enthalpy change (ΔH) for the reaction:\n\nΔH = -483.6 kJ/mol (for 2 moles of H2O produced)\n\nSince 4 moles of hydrogen and 2 moles of oxygen react to form 4 moles of water, we can calculate the total enthalpy change for this reaction:\n\nΔH_total = -483.6 kJ/mol × (4 moles H2O / 2 moles H2O) = -967.2 kJ\n\nAt constant temperature and pressure, the maximum work that can be obtained from the reaction is equal to the enthalpy change:\n\nW_max = ΔH_total = -967.2 kJ\n\nThe maximum amount of work that can be obtained from this reaction is 967.2 kJ."
