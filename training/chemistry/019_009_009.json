    "message_2": "To calculate the standard free energy change (ΔG°) of the redox reaction, we first need to determine the overall cell potential (E°cell) of the reaction using the given standard reduction potentials.\n\nThe balanced half-reactions are:\n\nFe3+(aq) + e- → Fe2+(aq)  E° = +0.771 V (Reduction)\nH2O2(aq) + 2H+(aq) + 2e- → 2H2O(l)  E° = +0.695 V (Reduction)\n\nWe need to reverse the first half-reaction to make it an oxidation reaction:\n\nFe2+(aq) → Fe3+(aq) + e-  E° = -0.771 V (Oxidation)\n\nNow, we can add the two half-reactions to obtain the overall redox reaction:\n\n2Fe2+(aq) + H2O2(aq) + 2H+(aq) → 2Fe3+(aq) + 2H2O(l)\n\nNext, we can calculate the overall cell potential (E°cell) by adding the standard reduction potentials of the two half-reactions:\n\nE°cell = E°(Oxidation) + E°(Reduction)\nE°cell = -0.771 V + 0.695 V\nE°cell = -0.076 V\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard free energy change (ΔG°) using the following formula:\n\nΔG° = -nFE°cell\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of electrons transferred (in this case, n = 2), F is Faraday's constant (96,485 C/mol), and E°cell is the overall cell potential.\n\nΔG° = -2 * 96,485 C/mol * (-0.076 V)\nΔG° = 14,660 J/mol\n\nSo, the standard free energy change (ΔG°) of the redox reaction at 298 K and 1 bar is 14,660 J/mol."
