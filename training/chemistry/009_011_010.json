    "message_2": "To determine the age of the fossil, we can use the formula for radioactive decay:\n\nN(t) = N0 * (1/2)^(t / t_half)\n\nWhere:\nN(t) is the amount of carbon-14 remaining at time t\nN0 is the initial amount of carbon-14\nt_half is the half-life of carbon-14 (5730 years)\nt is the time elapsed (the age of the fossil)\n\nIn this case, we are given that the fossil contains 30% of its original carbon-14, so N(t) = 0.3 * N0. We want to solve for t.\n\n0.3 * N0 = N0 * (1/2)^(t / 5730)\n\nDivide both sides by N0:\n\n0.3 = (1/2)^(t / 5730)\n\nNow, we can solve for t using logarithms. Take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(0.3) = ln((1/2)^(t / 5730))\n\nUsing the logarithmic identity ln(a^b) = b * ln(a), we can simplify the right side:\n\nln(0.3) = (t / 5730) * ln(1/2)\n\nNow, solve for t:\n\nt = (5730 * ln(0.3)) / ln(1/2)\n\nt ≈ 5730 * (-1.20397) / (-0.69315)\n\nt ≈ 9990 years\n\nThe age of the fossil is approximately 9990 years."
