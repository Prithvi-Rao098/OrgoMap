    "message_2": "Technetium-99m (99mTc) is a widely used radioisotope for medical imaging. It emits gamma radiation, which can be detected by gamma cameras to create images of the body's internal structures.\n\nThe chemical process used for the production of Technetium-99m is typically through the irradiation of Molybdenum-98 (98Mo) in a nuclear reactor. When Molybdenum-98 absorbs a neutron, it becomes Molybdenum-99 (99Mo), which has a half-life of about 66 hours and decays by beta emission to form Technetium-99m. The Technetium-99m is then extracted from the irradiated target material, usually by using a generator system that separates it from the remaining Molybdenum-99. This generator system is often called a \"moly cow\" or \"technetium cow\" and allows for the continuous production of Technetium-99m for medical use."
