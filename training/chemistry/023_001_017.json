    "message_2": "To calculate the theoretical yield of aspirin, we first need to determine the limiting reactant in the reaction between salicylic acid and acetic anhydride. The balanced chemical equation for the synthesis of aspirin is:\n\nC7H6O3 (salicylic acid) + C4H6O3 (acetic anhydride) â†’ C9H8O4 (aspirin) + C2H4O2 (acetic acid)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given amounts of reactants to moles. The molar mass of salicylic acid (C7H6O3) is 138.12 g/mol and the density of acetic anhydride (C4H6O3) is 1.08 g/mL, with a molar mass of 102.09 g/mol.\n\nMoles of salicylic acid = (2.0 g) / (138.12 g/mol) = 0.0145 mol\nMoles of acetic anhydride = (5.0 mL) * (1.08 g/mL) / (102.09 g/mol) = 0.0529 mol\n\nNow, we need to determine the limiting reactant by comparing the mole ratio of the reactants:\n\nMole ratio of salicylic acid to acetic anhydride = (0.0145 mol) / (0.0529 mol) = 0.274\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, salicylic acid is the limiting reactant because the mole ratio is less than 1.\n\nNow, we can calculate the theoretical yield of aspirin using the stoichiometry of the reaction and the moles of the limiting reactant (salicylic acid):\n\nMoles of aspirin = 0.0145 mol (since the stoichiometry is 1:1)\n\nThe molar mass of aspirin (C9H8O4) is 180.16 g/mol, so we can convert moles of aspirin to grams:\n\nTheoretical yield of aspirin = (0.0145 mol) * (180.16 g/mol) = 2.61 g\n\nTherefore, the theoretical yield of aspirin that can be obtained from the reaction of 2.0 grams of salicylic acid and 5.0 mL of acetic anhydride is 2.61 grams."
