    "message_2": "Primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols are classifications of alcohols based on the carbon atom to which the hydroxyl group (-OH) is attached. The difference between these three types of alcohols lies in the number of carbon atoms directly bonded to the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group. Their chemical reactivity also varies due to this structural difference.\n\n1. Primary alcohols (1°): In primary alcohols, the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group is bonded to only one other carbon atom and two hydrogen atoms. The general formula for primary alcohols is RCH2OH, where R is an alkyl group. For example, ethanol (CH3CH2OH) is a primary alcohol.\n\n2. Secondary alcohols (2°): In secondary alcohols, the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group is bonded to two other carbon atoms and one hydrogen atom. The general formula for secondary alcohols is R2CHOH, where R is an alkyl group. For example, isopropanol (CH3CHOHCH3) is a secondary alcohol.\n\n3. Tertiary alcohols (3°): In tertiary alcohols, the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group is bonded to three other carbon atoms and no hydrogen atoms. The general formula for tertiary alcohols is R3COH, where R is an alkyl group. For example, tert-butanol (CH3C(OH)(CH3)2) is a tertiary alcohol.\n\nThe chemical reactivity of primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols differs mainly in their oxidation reactions. Primary alcohols can be oxidized to form aldehydes (RCHO) and further to carboxylic acids (RCOOH) using oxidizing agents like potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7) or potassium permanganate (KMnO4). Secondary alcohols can be oxidized to form ketones (RCOR') using similar oxidizing agents. However, tertiary alcohols do not undergo oxidation reactions under normal conditions, as they lack the hydrogen atom on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group, which is necessary for oxidation to occur.\n\nFor example:\n- Ethanol (a primary alcohol) can be oxidized to form acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) and further to acetic acid (CH3COOH).\n- Isopropanol (a secondary alcohol) can be oxidized to form acetone (CH3COCH3).\n- Tert-butanol (a tertiary alcohol) does not undergo oxidation under normal conditions.\n\nIn summary, primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols differ in the number of carbon atoms directly bonded to the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group. This structural difference affects their chemical reactivity, particularly in oxidation reactions, where primary alcohols can be oxidized to aldehydes and carboxylic acids, secondary alcohols to ketones, and tertiary alcohols do not undergo oxidation under normal conditions."
