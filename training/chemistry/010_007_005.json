Given that the standard potential of the reduction reaction of Cu2+ to Cu is +0.34 V and the charge of one mole of electrons is 96500 C/mol.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the rate of electroplating of copper on a metallic surface, we need to determine the amount of copper deposited during the electroplating process. We can use Faraday's law of electrolysis to do this.\n\nFaraday's law states that the amount of substance deposited during electrolysis is directly proportional to the amount of charge passed through the solution. Mathematically, it can be represented as:\n\nmass of substance deposited (m) = (current (I) × time (t) × molar mass (M)) / (n × Faraday's constant (F))\n\nwhere:\n- m is the mass of the substance deposited (in grams)\n- I is the current (in amperes)\n- t is the time (in seconds)\n- M is the molar mass of the substance (in grams per mole)\n- n is the number of electrons involved in the redox reaction (in moles)\n- F is Faraday's constant (96500 C/mol)\n\nFirst, we need to determine the number of electrons involved in the reduction reaction of Cu²⁺ to Cu. The balanced half-reaction is:\n\nCu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu\n\nSo, n = 2 moles of electrons are involved in the reaction.\n\nNext, we need to convert the time from hours to seconds:\n\n3 hours × (3600 seconds/hour) = 10800 seconds\n\nNow, we can use Faraday's law to calculate the mass of copper deposited:\n\nm = (I × t × M) / (n × F)\nm = (2.5 A × 10800 s × 63.55 g/mol) / (2 mol × 96500 C/mol)\nm = (2.5 × 10800 × 63.55) / (2 × 96500)\nm ≈ 45.6 g\n\nSo, 45.6 grams of copper are deposited on the metallic surface during the electroplating process.\n\nTo calculate the rate of electroplating, we can divide the mass of copper deposited by the total time:\n\nrate of electroplating = mass of copper deposited / time\nrate of electroplating = 45.6 g / 3 hours\nrate of electroplating ≈ 15.2 g/hour\n\nTherefore, the rate of electroplating of copper on the metallic surface is approximately 15.2 grams per hour."
