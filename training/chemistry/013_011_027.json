    "message_1": "What is the critical micelle concentration of sodium dodecyl sulfate in water at 25°C, if the molar mass of SDS is 288.4 g/mol and its molecular formula is C12H25NaO4S?",
    "message_2": "The critical micelle concentration (CMC) of a surfactant like sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) is the concentration at which micelles start to form in a solution. The CMC is a property of the specific surfactant and depends on factors such as temperature, ionic strength, and the presence of other solutes.\n\nFor sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in water at 25°C, the CMC is typically reported to be around 8.2 x 10^-3 mol/L or 8.2 mM. This value can vary slightly depending on the specific experimental conditions and the purity of the SDS used."
