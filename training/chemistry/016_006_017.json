    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the following formula:\n\nΔH_reaction = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH_reaction is the enthalpy change for the reaction, ΔH_f(products) is the sum of the enthalpies of formation of the products, and ΔH_f(reactants) is the sum of the enthalpies of formation of the reactants.\n\nFor this reaction, we have:\n\nReactants: 2H₂(g) and O₂(g)\nProducts: 2H₂O(g)\n\nΔH_f(H₂O) = -242 kJ/mol\nΔH_f(O₂) = 0 kJ/mol\nΔH_f(H₂) = 0 kJ/mol (since it is an element in its standard state)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nΔH_reaction = [2 × (-242 kJ/mol)] - [2 × 0 kJ/mol + 0 kJ/mol]\n\nΔH_reaction = (-484 kJ) - (0 kJ)\n\nΔH_reaction = -484 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change for the reaction is -484 kJ."
