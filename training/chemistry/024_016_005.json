    "message_2": "To design a system that ensures the production of cosmetics with consistent quality while minimizing the use of harmful chemical additives, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Raw material selection: Choose high-quality, eco-friendly, and non-toxic raw materials for cosmetic formulations. Preferably, use natural and organic ingredients that are sustainably sourced and have minimal environmental impact.\n\n2. Green chemistry principles: Implement green chemistry principles in the formulation and manufacturing process. This includes using energy-efficient processes, reducing waste, and minimizing the use of hazardous substances.\n\n3. Quality control: Establish strict quality control measures at every stage of the production process, from raw material selection to finished product testing. This will ensure that the final product meets the desired quality standards and is free from harmful chemicals.\n\n4. Standard operating procedures (SOPs): Develop and implement standard operating procedures for all aspects of the production process. This will help maintain consistency in product quality and minimize the chances of contamination or errors.\n\n5. Training and education: Train employees on the importance of eco-friendly practices, safe handling of chemicals, and adherence to quality control measures. This will help create a culture of safety and environmental responsibility within the organization.\n\n6. Certification: Obtain relevant certifications, such as ISO 22716 (Good Manufacturing Practices for cosmetics) and ECOCERT (for organic and natural cosmetics), to demonstrate commitment to quality and environmental standards.\n\n7. Research and development: Invest in research and development to explore innovative, eco-friendly, and non-toxic alternatives to traditional cosmetic ingredients and formulations.\n\n8. Consumer education: Educate consumers about the benefits of using eco-friendly and non-toxic cosmetics, and encourage them to make informed choices when purchasing cosmetic products.\n\n9. Continuous improvement: Regularly review and update the production process, quality control measures, and employee training programs to ensure that the system remains effective in producing high-quality, eco-friendly cosmetics.\n\n10. Collaboration: Collaborate with industry partners, regulatory agencies, and research institutions to share knowledge, best practices, and new developments in the field of eco-friendly cosmetics. This will help drive innovation and improve the overall quality and safety of cosmetic products in the market."
