    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a question for the student:\n\nWhat is the standard free energy change for the following redox reaction at 298 K if the standard reduction potentials for the half-reactions are as follows?\n\nZn2+ (aq) + 2e- → Zn (s)  Eºred = -0.76 V\nCu2+ (aq) + 2e- → Cu (s)    Eºred = +0.34 V\n\n2 Zn (s) + Cu2+ (aq) → 2 Zn2+ (aq) + Cu (s) \n\n(Answer in kJ/mol)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard free energy change (ΔG°) for the redox reaction, we first need to determine the standard cell potential (E°cell) for the reaction. We can do this by subtracting the standard reduction potential of the anode (Zn) from the standard reduction potential of the cathode (Cu):\n\nE°cell = E°red(cathode) - E°red(anode)\nE°cell = (+0.34 V) - (-0.76 V)\nE°cell = +1.10 V\n\nNow, we can use the relationship between the standard cell potential and the standard free energy change:\n\nΔG° = -nFE°cell\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of electrons transferred (in this case, 2), F is Faraday's constant (96,485 C/mol), and E°cell is the standard cell potential.\n\nΔG° = -(2 mol)(96,485 C/mol)(1.10 V)\nΔG° = -212,667 J/mol\n\nSince the answer should be in kJ/mol, we need to convert J/mol to kJ/mol:\n\nΔG° = -212,667 J/mol * (1 kJ/1000 J) = -212.67 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard free energy change for the given redox reaction at 298 K is -212.67 kJ/mol."
