    "message_2": "Xenon hexafluoride (XeF4) is a molecule with an octahedral electron geometry. However, since there are only four fluorine atoms bonded to the central xenon atom, and two lone pairs of electrons, the molecular geometry is square planar.\n\nTo determine the polarity of XeF4, we need to consider the electronegativity of the atoms and the symmetry of the molecule. Fluorine is more electronegative than xenon, so the F-Xe bonds are polar. However, due to the square planar geometry of the molecule, these bond dipoles cancel each other out, making the molecule nonpolar.\n\nIn summary, XeF4 has a square planar molecular geometry and is a nonpolar compound."
