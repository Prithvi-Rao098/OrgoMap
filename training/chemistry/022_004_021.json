    "message_2": "In CH3OH (methanol), the oxidation number of carbon can be determined by considering the oxidation numbers of the other atoms in the molecule. \n\nThe oxidation number of hydrogen is +1, and there are three hydrogen atoms in the CH3 group. The oxidation number of oxygen is -2, and there is one oxygen atom in the OH group. The oxidation number of the hydrogen atom in the OH group is also +1.\n\nNow, let's set up an equation to find the oxidation number of carbon (C):\n\n(+1 * 3) + C + (-2) + (+1) = 0\n\n(3) + C + (-1) = 0\n\nC = -2\n\nSo, the oxidation number of carbon in CH3OH is -2."
