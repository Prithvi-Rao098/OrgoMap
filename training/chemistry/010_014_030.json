    "message_1": "What is the mass of silver deposited on the cathode during the electrolysis of a silver nitrate solution with a current of 5 amperes for 2 hours? The molar mass of silver is 107.87 g/mol and the charge on a single electron is 1.6 x 10^-19 coulombs. The Faraday constant is 96,485 coulombs.",
    "message_2": "To find the mass of silver deposited on the cathode, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total charge passed through the solution during electrolysis.\n2. Determine the number of moles of electrons transferred.\n3. Calculate the number of moles of silver deposited.\n4. Calculate the mass of silver deposited.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total charge\nTotal charge (Q) = Current (I) × Time (t)\nQ = 5 A × 2 hours × 3600 seconds/hour = 36,000 Coulombs\n\nStep 2: Determine the number of moles of electrons transferred\nMoles of electrons = Total charge (Q) / Faraday constant (F)\nMoles of electrons = 36,000 C / 96,485 C/mol = 0.373 mol\n\nStep 3: Calculate the number of moles of silver deposited\nSince the reaction is Ag+ + 1e- → Ag, one mole of electrons will deposit one mole of silver.\nMoles of silver = Moles of electrons = 0.373 mol\n\nStep 4: Calculate the mass of silver deposited\nMass of silver = Moles of silver × Molar mass of silver\nMass of silver = 0.373 mol × 107.87 g/mol = 40.23 g\n\nTherefore, the mass of silver deposited on the cathode during the electrolysis of the silver nitrate solution is 40.23 grams."
