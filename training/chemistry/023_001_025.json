    "message_2": "To calculate the maximum theoretical yield of aspirin, we first need to determine the balanced chemical equation for the synthesis of aspirin:\n\nC7H6O3 (salicylic acid) + C4H6O3 (acetic anhydride) â†’ C9H8O4 (aspirin) + C2H4O2 (acetic acid)\n\nNext, we need to find the molar mass of each compound:\n- Salicylic acid (C7H6O3): (7 x 12.01) + (6 x 1.01) + (3 x 16.00) = 138.12 g/mol\n- Aspirin (C9H8O4): (9 x 12.01) + (8 x 1.01) + (4 x 16.00) = 180.16 g/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the moles of salicylic acid used in the reaction:\nmoles of salicylic acid = mass / molar mass = 2.00 g / 138.12 g/mol = 0.0145 mol\n\nSince the reaction is in a 1:1 ratio, the moles of aspirin produced will also be 0.0145 mol. We can now calculate the maximum theoretical yield of aspirin:\n\nmass of aspirin = moles x molar mass = 0.0145 mol x 180.16 g/mol = 2.61 g\n\nThe maximum theoretical yield of aspirin is 2.61 grams.\n\nNow, we can calculate the percent yield of the reaction using the actual yield (1.75 g) and the theoretical yield (2.61 g):\n\npercent yield = (actual yield / theoretical yield) x 100 = (1.75 g / 2.61 g) x 100 = 67.05%\n\nThe percent yield of the reaction is 67.05%."
