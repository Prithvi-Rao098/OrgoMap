    "message_2": "The Lewis structure for carbon dioxide (CO2) is as follows:\n\nO = C = O\n\nIn this structure, the carbon atom (C) is in the center, with double bonds connecting it to each of the two oxygen atoms (O). Each oxygen atom has two lone pairs of electrons, while the carbon atom has no lone pairs."
