The electric current used in the process was 2.26 A, and the time taken to completely react the sample was 120 s. The molecular weight of NaCl is 58.44 g/mol, and 1 mol of NaCl contains 1 mol of Cl-.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of chloride ions (Cl-) present in the 0.500 g sample of sodium chloride (NaCl) solution using coulometry, we need to first determine the number of moles of electrons transferred during the reaction. \n\nCoulometry is based on Faraday's laws of electrolysis, which states that the amount of substance consumed or produced at an electrode during electrolysis is directly proportional to the amount of electric charge passed through the solution. The relationship between the amount of substance and the charge is given by:\n\nAmount of substance (in moles) = (Charge in coulombs) / (Faraday's constant × n)\n\nwhere n is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction, and Faraday's constant (F) is approximately 96485 C/mol.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total charge passed through the solution:\n\nCharge (Q) = Current (I) × Time (t)\nQ = 2.26 A × 120 s\nQ = 271.2 C\n\nIn the reaction, NaCl is dissociated into Na+ and Cl- ions. The reaction involves the transfer of one electron per chloride ion (Cl-):\n\nNaCl → Na+ + Cl-\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of moles of Cl- ions using Faraday's law:\n\nAmount of Cl- (in moles) = (Charge in coulombs) / (Faraday's constant × n)\nAmount of Cl- = 271.2 C / (96485 C/mol × 1)\nAmount of Cl- ≈ 0.00281 mol\n\nNow that we have the number of moles of Cl-, we can calculate the mass of Cl- in the sample:\n\nMass of Cl- = (Amount of Cl- in moles) × (Molecular weight of NaCl)\nMass of Cl- = 0.00281 mol × 58.44 g/mol\nMass of Cl- ≈ 0.164 g\n\nSo, there are approximately 0.164 g of chloride ions (Cl-) present in the 0.500 g sample of sodium chloride (NaCl) solution."
