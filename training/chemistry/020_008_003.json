    "message_1": "Assuming the volume of a container at equilibrium is 2 L, what is the new equilibrium concentration of NOCl if the volume is changed to 1 L, given that the initial concentration of NOCl is 0.10 M and the equilibrium constant (Kc) is 0.054?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the reaction for the dissociation of NOCl and the equilibrium constant expression. The reaction is:\n\n2 NOCl(g) ⇌ 2 NO(g) + Cl2(g)\n\nLet's denote the initial concentration of NOCl as [NOCl]₀ = 0.10 M, and the initial concentrations of NO and Cl2 as [NO]₀ = [Cl2]₀ = 0 M. When the volume is changed to 1 L, the initial concentration of NOCl will change. Let's denote the new initial concentration as [NOCl']₀.\n\nSince the number of moles of NOCl remains constant, we can use the formula:\n\nn = C × V\n\nWhere n is the number of moles, C is the concentration, and V is the volume. For the initial state:\n\nn₀ = [NOCl]₀ × V₀ = 0.10 M × 2 L = 0.20 moles\n\nFor the new state:\n\nn' = [NOCl']₀ × V' = [NOCl']₀ × 1 L\n\nSince the number of moles remains constant:\n\nn₀ = n'\n0.20 moles = [NOCl']₀ × 1 L\n[NOCl']₀ = 0.20 M\n\nNow, let's denote the change in concentration at equilibrium as x. The equilibrium concentrations will be:\n\n[NOCl] = 0.20 M - 2x\n[NO] = 0 M + 2x\n[Cl2] = 0 M + x\n\nThe equilibrium constant expression is:\n\nKc = ([NO]^2 × [Cl2]) / ([NOCl]^2)\n\nSubstitute the equilibrium concentrations and the given Kc value:\n\n0.054 = ((2x)^2 × x) / ((0.20 - 2x)^2)\n\nNow we need to solve this equation for x. It's a cubic equation, and solving it, we get:\n\nx ≈ 0.0367\n\nNow we can find the new equilibrium concentration of NOCl:\n\n[NOCl] = 0.20 M - 2x ≈ 0.20 M - 2(0.0367) ≈ 0.1266 M\n\nSo the new equilibrium concentration of NOCl is approximately 0.1266 M."
