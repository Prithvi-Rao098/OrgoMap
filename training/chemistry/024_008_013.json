    "message_2": "Designing a storage system for highly reactive and hazardous chemicals requires careful planning and consideration of various factors to ensure maximum safety and minimal environmental impact. Here are some key aspects to consider:\n\n1. Material compatibility: Choose storage materials that are compatible with the chemicals being stored. This may include using corrosion-resistant materials such as stainless steel, fiberglass, or high-density polyethylene (HDPE) for containers and storage tanks.\n\n2. Secondary containment: Implement secondary containment systems, such as double-walled tanks or containment basins, to prevent leaks and spills from escaping into the environment.\n\n3. Ventilation: Ensure proper ventilation in the storage area to prevent the buildup of hazardous fumes. This may include installing exhaust fans, air vents, or air filtration systems.\n\n4. Temperature control: Maintain appropriate temperature conditions to prevent chemical reactions or degradation. This may involve using insulation, heating, or cooling systems as needed.\n\n5. Fire protection: Install fire protection systems, such as sprinklers, fire extinguishers, or fire-resistant barriers, to minimize the risk of fires and explosions.\n\n6. Separation of incompatible chemicals: Store incompatible chemicals separately to prevent dangerous reactions. This may involve using separate storage cabinets, rooms, or containment areas.\n\n7. Labeling and signage: Clearly label all chemical containers and storage areas with the appropriate hazard information, such as chemical name, hazard class, and safety precautions.\n\n8. Access control: Limit access to authorized personnel only, and provide appropriate training on chemical handling and storage procedures.\n\n9. Spill response plan: Develop a spill response plan that outlines the steps to be taken in case of a chemical spill, including containment, cleanup, and disposal procedures.\n\n10. Regular inspections and maintenance: Conduct regular inspections of the storage area to identify potential hazards, such as leaks, corrosion, or structural damage. Perform routine maintenance on storage equipment, such as replacing worn seals or gaskets, to prevent failures.\n\n11. Waste management: Implement proper waste management procedures for disposing of hazardous chemicals, such as using licensed waste disposal facilities or recycling programs.\n\n12. Emergency response plan: Develop an emergency response plan that includes procedures for evacuating personnel, notifying emergency responders, and mitigating the impact of chemical releases.\n\nBy considering these factors and working closely with safety experts and regulatory agencies, a storage system for highly reactive and hazardous chemicals can be optimized for maximum safety and minimal environmental impact."
