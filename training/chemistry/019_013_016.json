    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy change for the neutralization reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH_reaction = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH_reaction is the standard enthalpy change for the reaction, and ΔH_f is the standard enthalpy of formation for each compound.\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\nΔH_reaction = [(-407.3 kJ/mol) + (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [(-167.2 kJ/mol) + (-470.1 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH_reaction = (-693.1 kJ/mol) - (-637.3 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH_reaction = -55.8 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the neutralization reaction between hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide is -55.8 kJ/mol."
