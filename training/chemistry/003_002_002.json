    "message_2": "To determine the boiling point of a solution, we can use the boiling point elevation formula:\n\nΔTb = Kb * molality * i\n\nwhere ΔTb is the change in boiling point, Kb is the boiling point elevation constant for water (0.512 °C/molal), molality is the molality of the solution, and i is the van't Hoff factor (number of particles the solute dissociates into). For sucrose, i = 1, as it does not dissociate into ions in water.\n\nFirst, we need to find the molality of the solution. Molality is defined as the moles of solute per kilogram of solvent.\n\nMolality = moles of solute / mass of solvent (in kg)\n\nThe molar mass of sucrose (C12H22O11) is:\n(12 * 12.01) + (22 * 1.01) + (11 * 16.00) = 144.12 + 22.22 + 176.00 = 342.34 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the moles of sucrose:\nmoles of sucrose = 10 g / 342.34 g/mol = 0.0292 mol\n\nNext, we need to convert the mass of water to kilograms:\n100 g = 0.1 kg\n\nNow, we can find the molality of the solution:\nMolality = 0.0292 mol / 0.1 kg = 0.292 molal\n\nNow, we can use the boiling point elevation formula:\nΔTb = Kb * molality * i\nΔTb = 0.512 °C/molal * 0.292 molal * 1\nΔTb = 0.149 °C\n\nThe boiling point of the solution will be the boiling point of pure water plus the change in boiling point:\nBoiling point of solution = boiling point of water + ΔTb\nBoiling point of solution = 100 °C + 0.149 °C = 100.149 °C\n\nSo, the boiling point of the solution is approximately 100.149 °C."
