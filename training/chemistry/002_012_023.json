    "message_2": "To determine the bond order and bond length of the nitrite ion (NO2-), we need to consider its resonance structures and molecular orbital theory.\n\nResonance structures of NO2-:\n\n1. O = N - O^-\n2. O^- - N = O\n\nIn both structures, there is one single bond and one double bond. The actual structure of NO2- is a hybrid of these two resonance structures, which means the bond order is between a single bond (1) and a double bond (2).\n\nBond order = (Number of electrons in bonding orbitals - Number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\n\nIn the case of NO2-, there are 2 bonding electrons in the σ bond and 4 bonding electrons in the π bond (2 from each resonance structure), making a total of 6 bonding electrons. There are 2 antibonding electrons in the π* orbital. \n\nBond order = (6 - 2) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2\n\nSo, the bond order of NO2- is 2, which means the bonds are somewhere between a single bond and a double bond.\n\nAs for the bond length, it is inversely proportional to the bond order. Since the bond order is between a single bond and a double bond, the bond length will be between the typical bond lengths of a single bond and a double bond. The exact bond length can be determined experimentally or through computational chemistry methods, but it is expected to be shorter than a single bond and longer than a double bond."
