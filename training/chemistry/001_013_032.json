    "message_2": "The synthesis of pyrrole from a 1,4-dicarbonyl compound and ammonia is known as the Paal-Knorr synthesis. Here's the step-by-step mechanism for this reaction:\n\n1. Nucleophilic attack of ammonia on one of the carbonyl groups:\nThe lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom of ammonia (NH3) attacks one of the carbonyl groups (C=O) in the 1,4-dicarbonyl compound, forming a tetrahedral intermediate.\n\n2. Proton transfer:\nA proton (H+) from the nitrogen atom in the tetrahedral intermediate is transferred to the oxygen atom of the adjacent carbonyl group, generating a hydroxyl group (OH) and an imine (C=N) in the molecule.\n\n3. Intramolecular cyclization:\nThe hydroxyl group (OH) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the imine carbon, forming a five-membered ring with the release of a water molecule (H2O).\n\n4. Tautomerization:\nThe molecule undergoes tautomerization, where a proton (H+) is transferred from the nitrogen atom to the hydroxyl group (OH), resulting in the formation of a double bond (C=C) and a nitrogen atom with a lone pair of electrons.\n\n5. Aromatization:\nThe molecule undergoes a final rearrangement to form the aromatic pyrrole ring. The lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom is delocalized into the ring, creating a conjugated system of alternating single and double bonds, which imparts aromatic stability to the pyrrole molecule.\n\nThe intermediates involved in this reaction are:\n- Tetrahedral intermediate (formed after the nucleophilic attack of ammonia)\n- Imine and hydroxyl-containing intermediate (formed after proton transfer)\n- Five-membered ring intermediate (formed after intramolecular cyclization)\n- Tautomeric intermediate (formed after tautomerization)\n\nThe final product is the aromatic pyrrole molecule."
