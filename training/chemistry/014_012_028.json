    "message_2": "Metallofullerenes are a class of endohedral fullerenes that contain one or more metal atoms encapsulated within the fullerene cage. The electronic properties of metallofullerenes are influenced by the type of metal atom(s) encapsulated within the cage. In this literature review, we will discuss the impact of metal substitution on the electronic properties of metallofullerene clusters.\n\n1. Metallofullerenes with transition metals:\n\nTransition metals, such as Sc, Y, and La, have been widely studied in metallofullerenes. The electronic properties of these metallofullerenes are influenced by the interaction between the metal atom and the carbon cage. For example, Sc-based metallofullerenes exhibit strong metal-cage interactions, leading to a high degree of electron transfer from the metal to the cage. This results in enhanced stability and unique electronic properties, such as high electron affinity and low ionization potential (Dorn et al., 1999).\n\n2. Metallofullerenes with alkali and alkaline earth metals:\n\nAlkali and alkaline earth metals, such as Li, Na, K, Ca, and Sr, have also been studied in metallofullerenes. These metallofullerenes exhibit weaker metal-cage interactions compared to transition metal-based metallofullerenes. The electronic properties of these metallofullerenes are mainly determined by the size and electronic configuration of the metal atom. For example, Li@C60 exhibits a high electron affinity due to the strong interaction between the Li atom and the carbon cage (Stevenson et al., 1999).\n\n3. Metallofullerenes with lanthanides and actinides:\n\nLanthanides and actinides, such as Ce, Pr, Nd, and U, have been encapsulated within fullerene cages. These metallofullerenes exhibit unique electronic properties due to the presence of f-electrons in the metal atoms. For example, Ce@C82 exhibits a high electron affinity and low ionization potential due to the strong interaction between the Ce atom and the carbon cage (Yang et al., 2007).\n\n4. Metallofullerenes with noble metals:\n\nNoble metals, such as Au, Ag, and Cu, have been encapsulated within fullerene cages. These metallofullerenes exhibit unique electronic properties due to the presence of d-electrons in the metal atoms. For example, Au@C60 exhibits a high electron affinity and low ionization potential due to the strong interaction between the Au atom and the carbon cage (Huang et al., 2011).\n\nIn conclusion, the electronic properties of metallofullerenes are significantly influenced by the type of metal atom(s) encapsulated within the fullerene cage. Metal substitution can lead to changes in the electronic structure, electron affinity, ionization potential, and stability of the metallofullerene cluster. Further research is needed to fully understand the impact of metal substitution on the electronic properties of metallofullerenes and to explore potential applications in areas such as electronics, energy storage, and catalysis."
