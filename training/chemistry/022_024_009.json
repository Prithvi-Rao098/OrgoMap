    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log ([A-]/[HA])\n\nFor acetic acid, the pKa is 4.74. We are given the pH (5.0) and the concentrations of acetic acid ([HA] = 0.3 M) and acetate ions ([A-] = 0.2 M). We need to find the volume of acetic acid and acetate ions to mix to prepare a 500 mL solution.\n\nFirst, let's rearrange the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to solve for the ratio of [A-]/[HA]:\n\nlog ([A-]/[HA]) = pH - pKa\nlog ([A-]/[HA]) = 5.0 - 4.74\nlog ([A-]/[HA]) = 0.26\n\nNow, find the ratio of [A-]/[HA]:\n\n[A-]/[HA] = 10^0.26 ≈ 1.82\n\nLet x be the volume of 0.3 M acetic acid solution and y be the volume of 0.2 M acetate ion solution. We have two equations:\n\n1. x + y = 500 mL (total volume)\n2. (0.2y)/(0.3x) = 1.82 (ratio of [A-]/[HA])\n\nNow, we can solve for x and y:\n\nFrom equation 1, y = 500 - x\n\nSubstitute this into equation 2:\n\n(0.2(500 - x))/(0.3x) = 1.82\n\nSimplify and solve for x:\n\n100 - 0.2x = 0.54x\n100 = 0.74x\nx ≈ 135 mL\n\nNow, find y:\n\ny = 500 - 135\ny ≈ 365 mL\n\nThe student should mix approximately 135 mL of 0.3 M acetic acid solution and 365 mL of 0.2 M acetate ion solution to prepare a 500 mL buffer solution with a pH of 5.0."
