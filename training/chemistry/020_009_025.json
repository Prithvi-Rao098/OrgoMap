    "message_2": "To determine the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation and the expression for Kc:\n\nH2(g) + I2(g) ⇌ 2HI(g)\n\nKc = [HI]^2 / ([H2] * [I2])\n\nNext, we need to find the change in concentration for each species at equilibrium. Since the initial concentration of HI is not given, we can assume it to be 0 M. The equilibrium concentration of HI is given as 0.40 M, so the change in concentration for HI is +0.40 M.\n\nFor the balanced equation, 1 mole of H2 reacts with 1 mole of I2 to produce 2 moles of HI. So, the change in concentration for H2 and I2 will be half of the change in concentration for HI:\n\nChange in [H2] = Change in [I2] = -0.40 M / 2 = -0.20 M\n\nNow, we can find the equilibrium concentrations for H2 and I2:\n\n[H2]_eq = 0.50 M - 0.20 M = 0.30 M\n[I2]_eq = 0.25 M - 0.20 M = 0.05 M\n\nFinally, we can plug these equilibrium concentrations into the Kc expression:\n\nKc = [HI]^2 / ([H2] * [I2])\nKc = (0.40 M)^2 / (0.30 M * 0.05 M)\nKc = 0.16 M^2 / 0.015 M^2\nKc ≈ 10.67\n\nThe equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction of hydrogen gas and iodine gas to form hydrogen iodide gas at room temperature is approximately 10.67."
