    "message_2": "To calculate the reaction quotient, Q, we use the expression for Q based on the balanced chemical equation and the partial pressures of the gases involved:\n\n$$Q = \\frac{[\\ce{CO2}] \\times [\\ce{H2O}]^2}{[\\ce{CH4}] \\times [\\ce{O2}]^2}$$\n\nPlugging in the given partial pressures:\n\n$$Q = \\frac{(0.0\\,\\text{atm}) \\times (0.0\\,\\text{atm})^2}{(0.25\\,\\text{atm}) \\times (0.75\\,\\text{atm})^2}$$\n\nSince the numerator is 0 (due to the partial pressures of CO2 and H2O being 0), Q is also 0:\n\n$$Q = 0$$\n\nNow, to determine if the reaction is at equilibrium or if it will shift towards the products or reactants, we need to compare Q to the equilibrium constant, K. However, K is not provided in this problem.\n\nNevertheless, we can still make a qualitative assessment. Since Q is 0 and the partial pressures of the products are 0, the reaction is not at equilibrium. The reaction will shift towards the products (CO2 and H2O) to reach equilibrium, as the forward reaction will occur to increase the concentrations of the products and decrease the concentrations of the reactants (CH4 and O2)."
