    "message_2": "To prepare 10 grams of p-nitroaniline from aniline and nitric acid with a yield of at least 80%, follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the required starting amount of aniline:\nSince the desired yield is 80%, you will need to start with a higher amount of aniline to account for the loss during the reaction. The molecular weight of aniline is 93.13 g/mol, and that of p-nitroaniline is 138.12 g/mol. To calculate the required starting amount of aniline:\n\n(10 g p-nitroaniline) / (138.12 g/mol p-nitroaniline) = 0.0724 mol p-nitroaniline\n0.0724 mol p-nitroaniline / 0.8 (80% yield) = 0.0905 mol aniline\n0.0905 mol aniline * (93.13 g/mol aniline) = 8.43 g aniline\n\n2. Prepare the reaction mixture:\nDissolve 8.43 g of aniline in 50 mL of glacial acetic acid in a round-bottom flask. Add a magnetic stirrer bar and set up the flask on a magnetic stirrer.\n\n3. Prepare the nitrating mixture:\nIn a separate container, mix 5.5 mL of concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) with 5.5 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4). This mixture will act as the nitrating agent.\n\n4. Add the nitrating mixture to the reaction flask:\nSlowly add the nitrating mixture to the aniline solution in the round-bottom flask while stirring. The addition should be done dropwise and with caution, as the reaction is exothermic and can generate heat. Make sure the temperature of the reaction mixture does not exceed 5°C by using an ice bath to cool the flask if necessary.\n\n5. Stir the reaction mixture:\nAfter the addition of the nitrating mixture, continue stirring the reaction mixture for 1 hour at a temperature below 5°C.\n\n6. Quench the reaction:\nSlowly pour the reaction mixture onto crushed ice and stir until the ice has melted. The p-nitroaniline will precipitate out of the solution.\n\n7. Filter and wash the product:\nFilter the precipitated p-nitroaniline using vacuum filtration. Wash the solid product with cold water to remove any remaining acid and impurities.\n\n8. Recrystallize the product:\nDissolve the crude p-nitroaniline in a minimal amount of hot ethanol. Allow the solution to cool slowly to room temperature, and then cool it further in an ice bath to promote crystal formation. Filter the crystals using vacuum filtration and allow them to air dry.\n\n9. Determine the yield and purity:\nWeigh the dried p-nitroaniline crystals to determine the actual yield. The purity of the product can be assessed using melting point determination and comparing it to the known melting point of p-nitroaniline (147-149°C). A narrow melting point range close to the literature value indicates high purity.\n\nAssuming an 80% yield, you should obtain approximately 10 grams of p-nitroaniline. The purity of the resulting product will depend on the efficiency of the washing and recrystallization steps, but it should be relatively high if the procedure is followed carefully."
