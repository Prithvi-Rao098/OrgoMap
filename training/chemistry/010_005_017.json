    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant for the given electrochemical cell reaction, we first need to determine the cell potential (E°cell) and then use the Nernst equation to find the equilibrium constant (K).\n\n1. Write the half-reactions for the given reaction:\nOxidation half-reaction (Cu is oxidized): Cu(s) → Cu2+(aq) + 2 e- \nReduction half-reaction (Ag+ is reduced): Ag+(aq) + 1 e- → Ag(s)\n\n2. Determine the standard reduction potentials for each half-reaction:\nE°red(Cu2+/Cu) = +0.34 V\nE°red(Ag+/Ag) = +0.80 V\n\n3. Calculate the standard cell potential (E°cell):\nSince Cu is being oxidized, we need to reverse the sign of its reduction potential to get the oxidation potential:\nE°ox(Cu/Cu2+) = -0.34 V\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard cell potential:\nE°cell = E°red(Ag+/Ag) - E°ox(Cu/Cu2+) = 0.80 V - (-0.34 V) = 1.14 V\n\n4. Use the Nernst equation to find the equilibrium constant (K):\nE°cell = (RT/nF) * ln(K)\nwhere R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin (25°C = 298 K), n is the number of electrons transferred (2 in this case), and F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol).\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for K:\nK = exp(nFE°cell/RT)\n\nPlug in the values:\nK = exp(2 * 96,485 C/mol * 1.14 V / (8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K))\n\nK ≈ 1.1 × 10^37\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant for the given electrochemical cell reaction at 25°C is approximately 1.1 × 10^37."
