    "message_2": "The energy released by a single uranium-235 atom undergoing a fission reaction is approximately 200 MeV (million electron volts), which is equivalent to 3.2 x 10^-11 Joules.\n\nTo calculate the total energy released by 1 kg of uranium-235 undergoing complete fission, we first need to determine the number of uranium-235 atoms in 1 kg. The atomic mass of uranium-235 is approximately 235 g/mol. \n\n1 kg of uranium-235 = 1000 g\n\nNumber of moles in 1 kg of uranium-235 = (1000 g) / (235 g/mol) = 4.2553 moles\n\nNow, we'll use Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol) to find the number of uranium-235 atoms in 1 kg:\n\nNumber of uranium-235 atoms = 4.2553 moles × (6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol) = 2.56 x 10^24 atoms\n\nNow, we'll multiply the number of atoms by the energy released per atom:\n\nTotal energy released = (2.56 x 10^24 atoms) × (3.2 x 10^-11 Joules/atom) = 8.192 x 10^13 Joules\n\nSo, the total energy released by 1 kg of uranium-235 undergoing complete fission is approximately 8.192 x 10^13 Joules."
