    "message_2": "In the molecule CH3OH (methanol), the carbon atom is bonded to three hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. To determine the hybridization state and orbital geometry of the carbon atom, we need to consider the number of electron domains around it.\n\nAn electron domain is a region where electrons are most likely to be found, such as a bond or a lone pair of electrons. In methanol, the carbon atom forms four sigma (Ïƒ) bonds: three C-H bonds and one C-O bond. There are no lone pairs on the carbon atom. Therefore, there are four electron domains around the carbon atom.\n\nTo accommodate these four electron domains, the carbon atom undergoes sp3 hybridization, which means it mixes one 2s orbital and three 2p orbitals to form four sp3 hybrid orbitals. These sp3 hybrid orbitals are arranged in a tetrahedral geometry around the carbon atom, with bond angles of approximately 109.5 degrees.\n\nSo, the hybridization state of the carbon atom in CH3OH is sp3, and its orbital geometry is tetrahedral."
