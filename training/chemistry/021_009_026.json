    "message_2": "The bond order of carbon dioxide (CO2) can be determined by analyzing its molecular orbital diagram and the Lewis structure. CO2 has a linear molecular geometry with a central carbon atom double-bonded to two oxygen atoms (O=C=O).\n\nEach double bond consists of one sigma (σ) bond and one pi (π) bond. The bond order is defined as the number of bonding electrons minus the number of antibonding electrons, divided by 2. In CO2, there are 4 bonding electrons (2 from each double bond) and no antibonding electrons. Therefore, the bond order of CO2 is:\n\nBond order = (4 - 0) / 2 = 2\n\nThe bond order of 2 indicates that CO2 has a double bond between the carbon and each oxygen atom. This bond order affects the molecule's stability and properties in several ways:\n\n1. Stability: A higher bond order generally correlates with increased stability. In CO2, the double bonds create a strong and stable molecule that is less likely to undergo chemical reactions.\n\n2. Bond length: As bond order increases, bond length typically decreases. In CO2, the double bonds result in shorter C-O bond lengths compared to a single bond, leading to a more compact molecule.\n\n3. Bond strength: A higher bond order also corresponds to stronger bonds. The double bonds in CO2 make the molecule more resistant to breaking apart, which contributes to its stability.\n\n4. Electronegativity: The electronegativity difference between carbon and oxygen leads to polar bonds in CO2. However, due to its linear geometry, the molecule is nonpolar as the dipole moments of the two C-O bonds cancel each other out.\n\nIn summary, the bond order of 2 in CO2 results in a stable, compact, and nonpolar molecule with strong double bonds between the carbon and oxygen atoms. These characteristics contribute to CO2's properties, such as its low reactivity and its role as a greenhouse gas in Earth's atmosphere."
