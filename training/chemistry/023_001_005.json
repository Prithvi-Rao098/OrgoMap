    "message_2": "To calculate the theoretical yield of aspirin from 5 grams of salicylic acid, we need to use stoichiometry. First, we need the balanced chemical equation for the synthesis of aspirin:\n\nC7H6O3 (salicylic acid) + C4H6O3 (acetic anhydride) → C9H8O4 (aspirin) + C2H4O2 (acetic acid)\n\nNow, we need the molar masses of salicylic acid and aspirin:\n\nSalicylic acid (C7H6O3): (7 × 12.01) + (6 × 1.01) + (3 × 16.00) = 138.12 g/mol\nAspirin (C9H8O4): (9 × 12.01) + (8 × 1.01) + (4 × 16.00) = 180.16 g/mol\n\nNext, we need to convert the mass of salicylic acid to moles:\n\n5 g salicylic acid × (1 mol salicylic acid / 138.12 g) = 0.0362 mol salicylic acid\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, the moles of salicylic acid will be equal to the moles of aspirin produced:\n\n0.0362 mol salicylic acid = 0.0362 mol aspirin\n\nNow, we can convert the moles of aspirin back to grams:\n\n0.0362 mol aspirin × (180.16 g / 1 mol aspirin) = 6.52 g aspirin\n\nTherefore, the theoretical yield of aspirin that can be obtained from 5 grams of salicylic acid using excess acetic anhydride in the synthesis process is 6.52 grams."
