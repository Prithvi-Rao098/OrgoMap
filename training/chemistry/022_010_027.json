    "message_2": "When a solution of silver nitrate (AgNO3) is mixed with a solution of sodium chloride (NaCl), a white precipitate of silver chloride (AgCl) is formed. This is due to a double displacement reaction, also known as a metathesis reaction, taking place between the two compounds.\n\nThe chemical reaction can be represented as follows:\n\nAgNO3(aq) + NaCl(aq) â†’ AgCl(s) + NaNO3(aq)\n\nIn this reaction, the silver (Ag+) ions from silver nitrate combine with the chloride (Cl-) ions from sodium chloride to form the insoluble silver chloride precipitate. Simultaneously, the sodium (Na+) ions from sodium chloride combine with the nitrate (NO3-) ions from silver nitrate to form the soluble sodium nitrate (NaNO3).\n\nTo identify the precipitate, you can perform a few tests:\n\n1. Visual inspection: Silver chloride precipitate is white and forms immediately upon mixing the two solutions.\n\n2. Solubility test: Silver chloride is insoluble in water but dissolves in ammonia solution. If you add dilute ammonia to the precipitate, it should dissolve, confirming the presence of silver chloride.\n\n3. Light sensitivity test: Silver chloride is photosensitive and will darken upon exposure to light, turning grey or purple. If you expose the precipitate to sunlight or UV light and observe a color change, it further confirms the presence of silver chloride."
