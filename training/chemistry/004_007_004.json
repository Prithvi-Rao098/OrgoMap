    "message_1": "What is the mass percentage of copper (Cu) in a sample of pure copper chloride (CuCl2) obtained from gravimetric analysis if 2.57 g of copper chloride were heated to drive off all the HCl and water vapor and only 1.97 g of pure copper remained?",
    "message_2": "To find the mass percentage of copper (Cu) in a sample of pure copper chloride (CuCl2), we can use the following formula:\n\nMass percentage of Cu = (mass of Cu / mass of CuCl2) × 100\n\nGiven that 2.57 g of copper chloride were heated and 1.97 g of pure copper remained, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nMass percentage of Cu = (1.97 g / 2.57 g) × 100\n\nMass percentage of Cu ≈ 0.7665 × 100\n\nMass percentage of Cu ≈ 76.65%\n\nTherefore, the mass percentage of copper (Cu) in the sample of pure copper chloride (CuCl2) is approximately 76.65%."
