    "message_2": "Nuclear medicine utilizes radioisotopes for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Some of the most common radioisotopes used in nuclear medicine and their respective production methods are:\n\n1. Technetium-99m (Tc-99m)\nProduction method: Tc-99m is obtained from the decay of its parent isotope, Molybdenum-99 (Mo-99), which is produced by irradiating Uranium-235 (U-235) targets in a nuclear reactor. The Mo-99 decays to Tc-99m through a process called beta decay.\n\n2. Iodine-131 (I-131)\nProduction method: I-131 is produced by irradiating a target material, usually Tellurium, with neutrons in a nuclear reactor. The Tellurium absorbs a neutron and undergoes beta decay to form I-131.\n\n3. Fluorine-18 (F-18)\nProduction method: F-18 is produced by irradiating a target material, usually Oxygen-18-enriched water, with protons in a cyclotron. The Oxygen-18 captures a proton and undergoes a nuclear reaction to form F-18.\n\n4. Gallium-67 (Ga-67)\nProduction method: Ga-67 is produced by irradiating a target material, usually Zinc, with neutrons in a nuclear reactor. The Zinc absorbs a neutron and undergoes a series of nuclear reactions and decays to form Ga-67.\n\n5. Thallium-201 (Tl-201)\nProduction method: Tl-201 is produced by irradiating a target material, usually Thallium-203, with protons in a cyclotron. The Thallium-203 captures a proton and undergoes a nuclear reaction to form Tl-201.\n\n6. Indium-111 (In-111)\nProduction method: In-111 is produced by irradiating a target material, usually Cadmium, with neutrons in a nuclear reactor. The Cadmium absorbs a neutron and undergoes a series of nuclear reactions and decays to form In-111.\n\n7. Yttrium-90 (Y-90)\nProduction method: Y-90 is produced by irradiating a target material, usually Strontium-90, with neutrons in a nuclear reactor. The Strontium-90 absorbs a neutron and undergoes a nuclear reaction to form Y-90.\n\nThese radioisotopes are used in various diagnostic imaging techniques, such as single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET), as well as in targeted radiotherapy for cancer treatment."
