    "message_2": "The electronegativity difference between a fluorine atom and a lithium atom can be calculated by subtracting the electronegativity value of lithium from that of fluorine:\n\nElectronegativity difference = Electronegativity of Fluorine - Electronegativity of Lithium\nElectronegativity difference = 4.0 - 0.98\nElectronegativity difference = 3.02\n\nSo, the electronegativity difference between a fluorine atom and a lithium atom is 3.02."
