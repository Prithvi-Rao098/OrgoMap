    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the formation of one mole of methane (CH4) gas, we can use the following balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane:\n\nCH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l)\n\nWe are given the heat of combustion of methane gas (-890.36 kJ/mol), the heat of formation of water liquid (-285.83 kJ/mol), and the heat of formation of carbon dioxide gas (-393.52 kJ/mol).\n\nWe can use Hess's law to find the heat of formation of methane gas. Hess's law states that the enthalpy change of a reaction is the same, whether it occurs in one step or several steps. Therefore, we can write the following equation:\n\nΔH(formation of CH4) = ΔH(combustion of CH4) + ΔH(formation of CO2) + 2 × ΔH(formation of H2O)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nΔH(formation of CH4) = -890.36 kJ/mol + (-393.52 kJ/mol) + 2 × (-285.83 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH(formation of CH4) = -890.36 kJ/mol + 393.52 kJ/mol + (-571.66 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH(formation of CH4) = -1068.50 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the formation of one mole of methane (CH4) gas is -1068.50 kJ/mol."
