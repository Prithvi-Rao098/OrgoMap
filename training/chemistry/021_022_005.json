    "message_2": "To determine the acidity or basicity of the given molecules, we need to analyze their behavior in water and their ability to donate or accept protons (H+ ions).\n\n1. Ammonia (NH3): Ammonia is a weak base. When it dissolves in water, it accepts a proton (H+) from water to form the ammonium ion (NH4+) and hydroxide ion (OH-). The reaction is as follows:\n\nNH3 + H2O ⇌ NH4+ + OH-\n\n2. Hydrogen chloride (HCl): HCl is a strong acid. When it dissolves in water, it donates a proton (H+) to water, forming hydronium ions (H3O+) and chloride ions (Cl-). The reaction is as follows:\n\nHCl + H2O → H3O+ + Cl-\n\n3. Water (H2O): Water is amphoteric, meaning it can act as both an acid and a base. In pure water, a small number of water molecules donate a proton to another water molecule, forming hydronium ions (H3O+) and hydroxide ions (OH-). The reaction is as follows:\n\n2H2O ⇌ H3O+ + OH-\n\n4. Carbon dioxide (CO2): CO2 is not an acid or a base by itself, but when it dissolves in water, it forms carbonic acid (H2CO3), which is a weak acid. The reaction is as follows:\n\nCO2 + H2O ⇌ H2CO3\n\nNow, let's rank these molecules in order of increasing acidity and increasing basicity:\n\nIncreasing basicity: CO2 < H2O < NH3\nIncreasing acidity: NH3 < H2O < HCl\n\nReasoning:\n- CO2 is the least basic because it does not directly form hydroxide ions (OH-), but it forms a weak acid (H2CO3) when dissolved in water.\n- H2O is more basic than CO2 because it can form hydroxide ions (OH-) and is amphoteric.\n- NH3 is the most basic because it readily accepts protons (H+) and forms hydroxide ions (OH-) in water.\n\n- NH3 is the least acidic because it acts as a base in water.\n- H2O is more acidic than NH3 because it can donate protons (H+) and is amphoteric.\n- HCl is the most acidic because it readily donates protons (H+) in water, forming hydronium ions (H3O+)."
