    "message_2": "To calculate the specific surface area of the activated carbon sample, you can use the following formula:\n\nSpecific Surface Area (SSA) = BET value × mass of the sample\n\nGiven the BET value is 1000 m²/g and the mass of the sample is 0.5 g:\n\nSSA = 1000 m²/g × 0.5 g\n\nSSA = 500 m²\n\nThe specific surface area of the activated carbon sample is 500 m²."
