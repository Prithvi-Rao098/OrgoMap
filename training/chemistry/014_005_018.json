    "message_2": "The coordination geometry of [Fe(H2O)6]2+ in aqueous solution is octahedral. This is because the Fe(II) ion is surrounded by six water molecules acting as ligands, which are arranged in an octahedral manner around the central metal ion. UV-Vis spectroscopy can be used to confirm this coordination geometry by analyzing the d-d transitions of the complex, which are characteristic of octahedral complexes."
