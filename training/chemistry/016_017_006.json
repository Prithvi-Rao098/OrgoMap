    "message_2": "To find the enthalpy of oxidation for the given reaction, we need to consider the enthalpy changes involved in the process. The reaction can be broken down into two steps:\n\n1. Sublimation of sodium (Na):\n2Na(s) → 2Na(g); ΔH_sublimation = 2 * 109 kJ/mol = 218 kJ/mol\n\n2. Formation of sodium oxide (Na2O):\n2Na(g) + 1/2O2(g) → Na2O(s); ΔH_formation = -414 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the overall enthalpy change for the reaction by adding the enthalpy changes for each step:\n\nΔH_total = ΔH_sublimation + ΔH_formation\nΔH_total = 218 kJ/mol + (-414 kJ/mol)\nΔH_total = -196 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy of oxidation for the reaction 2Na(s) + 1/2O2(g) → Na2O(s) is -196 kJ/mol."
