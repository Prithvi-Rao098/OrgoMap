    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat required to melt the ice, we need to first determine the number of moles of ice present. The molecular weight of water (H2O) is 18.015 g/mol.\n\n1. Calculate the number of moles of ice:\nmoles of ice = mass of ice / molecular weight of water\nmoles of ice = 15 g / 18.015 g/mol\nmoles of ice ≈ 0.833 moles\n\n2. Calculate the amount of heat required to melt the ice:\nheat required = moles of ice × enthalpy of fusion\nheat required = 0.833 moles × 6.01 kJ/mol\nheat required ≈ 5.01 kJ\n\nThe total amount of heat required to completely melt the 15 grams of ice at 0°C is approximately 5.01 kJ."
