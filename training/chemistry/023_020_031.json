    "message_1": "What is the yield of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid formed when 10 grams of benzoic acid and excess chlorine gas are used in the synthesis, if the actual yield obtained is only 6.5 grams?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the yield of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid, we need to first determine the theoretical yield and then compare it to the actual yield obtained.\n\n1. Calculate the moles of benzoic acid used:\nThe molecular weight of benzoic acid (C7H6O2) is 122.12 g/mol.\nmoles of benzoic acid = (mass of benzoic acid) / (molecular weight of benzoic acid)\nmoles of benzoic acid = (10 g) / (122.12 g/mol) = 0.0819 mol\n\n2. Determine the stoichiometry of the reaction:\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\nC7H6O2 + 2 Cl2 â†’ C7H4Cl2O2\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of benzoic acid reacts with 2 moles of chlorine gas to produce 1 mole of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid.\n\n3. Calculate the theoretical yield of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid:\nSince we have excess chlorine gas, benzoic acid is the limiting reagent. Therefore, the moles of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid produced will be equal to the moles of benzoic acid used.\nmoles of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid = 0.0819 mol\n\nThe molecular weight of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid (C7H4Cl2O2) is 191.02 g/mol.\ntheoretical yield of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid = (moles of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid) * (molecular weight of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid)\ntheoretical yield = (0.0819 mol) * (191.02 g/mol) = 15.64 g\n\n4. Calculate the percentage yield:\npercentage yield = (actual yield / theoretical yield) * 100\npercentage yield = (6.5 g / 15.64 g) * 100 = 41.56%\n\nThe yield of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid formed in this synthesis is 41.56%."
