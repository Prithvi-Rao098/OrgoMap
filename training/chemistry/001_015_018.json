    "message_2": "To synthesize 2-methylhexane from 2-bromohexane, we can follow these steps using retrosynthetic analysis:\n\n1. First, we need to introduce a methyl group at the 2nd carbon of the 2-bromohexane. We can achieve this through a Grignard reaction. \n\nRetrosynthetic analysis:\n2-methylhexane <-- 2-hexanone + 2-methylmagnesium bromide\n\n2. Now, we need to synthesize the required reagents for the Grignard reaction. We already have 2-bromohexane as our starting material. To synthesize 2-hexanone, we can perform a haloform reaction using 2-bromohexane.\n\nRetrosynthetic analysis:\n2-hexanone <-- 2-bromohexane + NaOH + I2\n\n3. To synthesize 2-methylmagnesium bromide, we can react methyl bromide with magnesium metal.\n\nRetrosynthetic analysis:\n2-methylmagnesium bromide <-- CH3Br + Mg\n\nNow, let's put the steps together in a forward synthesis:\n\n1. Perform a haloform reaction: React 2-bromohexane with NaOH and I2 to form 2-hexanone.\n2. Prepare the Grignard reagent: React CH3Br with Mg to form 2-methylmagnesium bromide.\n3. Perform the Grignard reaction: React 2-hexanone with 2-methylmagnesium bromide to form 2-methylhexane.\n\nNote: Since the question states that 2-bromohexane is the only organic starting material, we assume that inorganic reagents like NaOH, I2, CH3Br, and Mg are available for use."
