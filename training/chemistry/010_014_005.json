    "message_1": "What mass of copper is deposited on the cathode when a current of 10 A is applied for 3 hours in an electrolytic cell containing a copper nitrate solution with a concentration of 0.5 M? (Atomic mass of copper = 63.5 g/mol; Faraday's constant = 96500 C/mol)",
    "message_2": "To determine the mass of copper deposited on the cathode, we need to use the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total charge passed through the electrolytic cell.\n2. Determine the number of moles of electrons passed through the cell.\n3. Calculate the number of moles of copper deposited.\n4. Determine the mass of copper deposited.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total charge passed through the electrolytic cell.\nTotal charge (Q) = Current (I) × Time (t)\nQ = 10 A × (3 hours × 3600 seconds/hour) = 10 A × 10800 s = 108000 C\n\nStep 2: Determine the number of moles of electrons passed through the cell.\nNumber of moles of electrons (n) = Total charge (Q) / Faraday's constant (F)\nn = 108000 C / 96500 C/mol = 1.11856 mol\n\nStep 3: Calculate the number of moles of copper deposited.\nThe balanced half-reaction for the reduction of copper(II) ions at the cathode is:\nCu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu\n\nFrom the stoichiometry of the reaction, 2 moles of electrons are required to deposit 1 mole of copper. Therefore, the number of moles of copper deposited is half the number of moles of electrons.\n\nMoles of copper = 1.11856 mol electrons × (1 mol Cu / 2 mol electrons) = 0.55928 mol Cu\n\nStep 4: Determine the mass of copper deposited.\nMass of copper = Moles of copper × Atomic mass of copper\nMass of copper = 0.55928 mol Cu × 63.5 g/mol = 35.5148 g\n\nSo, the mass of copper deposited on the cathode is approximately 35.51 g."
