    "message_2": "The formation of a complex ion between Fe3+ and SCN- can be represented by the following equilibrium reaction:\n\nFe3+(aq) + SCN-(aq) ⇌ FeSCN2+(aq)\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is given by:\n\nK = [FeSCN2+] / ([Fe3+][SCN-])\n\nWhen the pH of the solution is increased, the concentration of H+ ions decreases. This can affect the formation of the complex ion in several ways.\n\n1. Formation of hydroxide complexes: As the pH increases, the concentration of OH- ions increases. This can lead to the formation of hydroxide complexes with Fe3+ ions, such as Fe(OH)2+ and Fe(OH)2+. The relevant reactions are:\n\nFe3+(aq) + OH-(aq) ⇌ Fe(OH)2+(aq)\nFe3+(aq) + 2OH-(aq) ⇌ Fe(OH)2(aq)\n\nThese reactions will decrease the concentration of free Fe3+ ions in the solution, shifting the equilibrium of the FeSCN2+ complex formation to the left, and thus reducing the formation of the complex ion.\n\n2. Deprotonation of SCN-: As the pH increases, SCN- can undergo deprotonation to form HSCN:\n\nSCN-(aq) + H2O(l) ⇌ HSCN(aq) + OH-(aq)\n\nThis reaction will decrease the concentration of free SCN- ions in the solution, also shifting the equilibrium of the FeSCN2+ complex formation to the left, and reducing the formation of the complex ion.\n\n3. Formation of other complexes: At higher pH values, other metal ions present in the solution may form complexes with SCN-, further reducing the concentration of free SCN- ions and decreasing the formation of the FeSCN2+ complex.\n\nIn summary, increasing the pH of the solution can lead to a decrease in the formation of the FeSCN2+ complex ion due to the formation of hydroxide complexes with Fe3+, deprotonation of SCN-, and the formation of other complexes with SCN-. This can be observed as a decrease in the intensity of the red color associated with the FeSCN2+ complex."
