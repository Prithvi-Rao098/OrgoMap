    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change of dissolution for 5.00 grams of solid sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in 100.0 mL of water at 25°C, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the moles of NaOH.\n2. Use the molar enthalpy of dissolution to find the enthalpy change.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the moles of NaOH\nThe molar mass of NaOH = 22.99 (Na) + 15.999 (O) + 1.007 (H) = 39.996 g/mol\n\nmoles of NaOH = mass / molar mass\nmoles of NaOH = 5.00 g / 39.996 g/mol = 0.125 mol\n\nStep 2: Use the molar enthalpy of dissolution to find the enthalpy change\nΔH = moles × molar enthalpy of dissolution\nΔH = 0.125 mol × (-44.51 kJ/mol)\nΔH = -5.56 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change of dissolution for 5.00 grams of solid sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in 100.0 mL of water at 25°C is -5.56 kJ."
