    "message_2": "To determine the rate constant, k, for the free-radical polymerization of styrene, we can use the following equation:\n\nk = (M_n * I * p) / (2 * t * [M]_0)\n\nwhere:\n- M_n is the number-average molecular weight of the polymer (100,000 g/mol)\n- I is the initiator concentration (0.005 M)\n- p is the initiator efficiency (assumed to be 1 for simplicity)\n- t is the polymerization time (2 hours)\n- [M]_0 is the initial monomer concentration (0.1 M)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nk = (100,000 * 0.005 * 1) / (2 * 2 * 0.1)\n\nk = 500 / 0.4\n\nk = 1250 L/mol·h\n\nTherefore, the rate constant, k, for the free-radical polymerization of styrene is 1250 L/mol·h."
