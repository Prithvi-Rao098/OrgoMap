    "message_2": "The effect on the solubility of a sparingly soluble salt when the concentration of its common-ion is increased is a decrease in solubility. This is due to the common-ion effect, which states that the solubility of a sparingly soluble salt is decreased in the presence of a common ion.\n\nTo calculate the new solubility of lead(II) chloride (PbCl2) in a solution that contains 0.02 M of potassium chloride (KCl), we can use the solubility product constant (Ksp) of PbCl2, which is 1.6 x 10^-5.\n\nFirst, we write the balanced chemical equation for the dissolution of PbCl2:\n\nPbCl2 (s) ⇌ Pb2+ (aq) + 2Cl- (aq)\n\nNext, we write the expression for the solubility product constant (Ksp):\n\nKsp = [Pb2+] [Cl-]^2\n\nSince the solution contains 0.02 M of KCl, the initial concentration of Cl- ions is 0.02 M. Let x be the solubility of PbCl2 in moles per liter. Then, the concentration of Pb2+ ions will be x, and the concentration of Cl- ions will be 2x + 0.02.\n\nNow we can substitute these concentrations into the Ksp expression:\n\n1.6 x 10^-5 = (x) (2x + 0.02)^2\n\nTo solve for x, we can make an approximation that 2x is much smaller than 0.02, so we can simplify the equation to:\n\n1.6 x 10^-5 = (x) (0.02)^2\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 1.6 x 10^-5 / (0.02)^2\nx ≈ 4.0 x 10^-4 M\n\nSo, the new solubility of lead(II) chloride (PbCl2) in a solution that contains 0.02 M of potassium chloride (KCl) is approximately 4.0 x 10^-4 M."
