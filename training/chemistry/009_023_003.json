    "message_1": "What is the half-life of Technetium-99m, a commonly used radionuclide in medical imaging, if it decays with a rate constant of 0.115 per hour? Given that the initial activity of a source containing Technetium-99m is 100 mCi, how long will it take for the activity to drop to 25 mCi?",
    "message_2": "To find the half-life of Technetium-99m, we can use the formula:\n\nHalf-life (t1/2) = ln(2) / rate constant (k)\n\nwhere ln(2) is the natural logarithm of 2, and k is the rate constant (0.115 per hour).\n\nt1/2 = ln(2) / 0.115 ≈ 6.02 hours\n\nThe half-life of Technetium-99m is approximately 6.02 hours.\n\nTo find the time it takes for the activity to drop from 100 mCi to 25 mCi, we can use the decay formula:\n\nFinal activity (A) = Initial activity (A0) * e^(-kt)\n\nwhere A is the final activity (25 mCi), A0 is the initial activity (100 mCi), k is the rate constant (0.115 per hour), and t is the time in hours.\n\n25 = 100 * e^(-0.115t)\n\nDivide both sides by 100:\n\n0.25 = e^(-0.115t)\n\nNow, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(0.25) = -0.115t\n\nSolve for t:\n\nt = ln(0.25) / -0.115 ≈ 9.98 hours\n\nIt will take approximately 9.98 hours for the activity to drop from 100 mCi to 25 mCi."
