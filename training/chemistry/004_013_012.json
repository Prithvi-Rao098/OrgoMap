    "message_1": "What is the amount of copper present in a 0.2500 g sample of a copper salt, if it requires 12500 C of electricity to completely deposit it during coulometric titration?",
    "message_2": "To determine the amount of copper present in the sample, we can use Faraday's law of electrolysis. Faraday's law states that the amount of substance deposited or dissolved at an electrode during electrolysis is directly proportional to the quantity of charge passed through the electrolyte.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of electrons (n) that have been transferred during the electrolysis. We can do this using the formula:\n\nn = Q / (F * z)\n\nwhere:\n- n is the number of moles of electrons\n- Q is the charge passed through the electrolyte (12500 C)\n- F is Faraday's constant (96485 C/mol)\n- z is the charge of the ion (for copper, Cu, z = 2 since it forms Cu²⁺ ions)\n\nn = 12500 C / (96485 C/mol * 2) = 0.0648 mol\n\nNow that we have the number of moles of electrons, we can find the number of moles of copper deposited:\n\nSince the charge of the copper ion is 2 (Cu²⁺), each mole of copper requires 2 moles of electrons to be deposited. Therefore, the number of moles of copper deposited is equal to half the number of moles of electrons:\n\nmoles of Cu = 0.0648 mol / 2 = 0.0324 mol\n\nNow we can find the mass of copper deposited using the molar mass of copper (63.55 g/mol):\n\nmass of Cu = moles of Cu * molar mass of Cu\nmass of Cu = 0.0324 mol * 63.55 g/mol = 2.058 g\n\nHowever, this value seems to be larger than the initial mass of the copper salt (0.2500 g). There must be a mistake in the given data or the problem statement, as the mass of copper cannot be greater than the mass of the copper salt. Please double-check the values provided and ensure they are correct."
