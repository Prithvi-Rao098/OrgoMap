    "message_2": "The major product of the elimination reaction between 2-methylcyclohexanol and concentrated phosphoric acid in the presence of heat is 1-methylcyclohexene. This reaction proceeds via an E1 mechanism, where the alcohol is first protonated by the phosphoric acid to form a good leaving group (water), and then a carbocation is formed at the 2-position. The most stable carbocation is formed due to the methyl group's hyperconjugation, and finally, a Î²-hydrogen is eliminated to form the alkene. The major product is the more stable alkene, which in this case is 1-methylcyclohexene due to its higher degree of substitution."
