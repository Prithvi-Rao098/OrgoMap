    "message_1": "Given the equilibrium reaction: 2NOCl(g) ⇌ 2NO(g) + Cl2(g), if the equilibrium constant (Kc) at 25°C is 2.45 x 10^-3, what will be the new value of Kc if the temperature is increased to 50°C?",
    "message_2": "To determine the new value of Kc at 50°C, we need to know the relationship between the equilibrium constant and temperature. This relationship is given by the van't Hoff equation:\n\nln(K2/K1) = -ΔH°/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nWhere:\n- K1 and K2 are the equilibrium constants at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively\n- ΔH° is the standard enthalpy change of the reaction\n- R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\n- T1 and T2 are the initial and final temperatures in Kelvin, respectively\n\nHowever, we do not have enough information to use the van't Hoff equation, as the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) is not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the new value of Kc at 50°C with the given information."
