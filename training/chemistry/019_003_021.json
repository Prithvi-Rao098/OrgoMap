    "message_2": "The specific heat capacity of water is 4.184 J/g°C. To find the heat capacity of 25 grams of water, we can use the formula:\n\nHeat capacity = mass × specific heat capacity\n\nHeat capacity = 25 g × 4.184 J/g°C\n\nHeat capacity = 104.6 J/°C\n\nSo, the heat capacity of 25 grams of water at 25°C is 104.6 J/°C."
