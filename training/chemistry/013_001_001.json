    "message_2": "The effect of temperature on the adsorption of hydrogen gas on a solid surface of activated carbon can be explained by the adsorption isotherm models and thermodynamics. Generally, the adsorption capacity of hydrogen gas on activated carbon decreases with increasing temperature. This is because the adsorption process is typically exothermic, meaning that it releases heat during the process.\n\nExperimental evidence to support this can be found in various studies conducted on the adsorption of hydrogen gas on activated carbon at different temperatures. One such study is by Panella et al. (2006), who investigated the hydrogen storage capacity of activated carbons at different temperatures (77 K, 87 K, and 298 K) and pressures (up to 10 MPa).\n\nThe results of their study showed that the hydrogen adsorption capacity decreased with increasing temperature. At 77 K, the maximum hydrogen uptake was found to be 5.5 wt%, while at 87 K, it decreased to 4.5 wt%. At room temperature (298 K), the hydrogen adsorption capacity was significantly lower, at around 0.5 wt%.\n\nThe decrease in adsorption capacity with increasing temperature can be explained by the fact that higher temperatures provide more energy to the hydrogen molecules, which can overcome the attractive forces between the gas molecules and the activated carbon surface. As a result, the hydrogen molecules are less likely to be adsorbed onto the activated carbon surface at higher temperatures.\n\nIn conclusion, the adsorption of hydrogen gas on a solid surface of activated carbon is affected by temperature, with the adsorption capacity generally decreasing as the temperature increases. This is supported by experimental evidence from studies such as the one conducted by Panella et al. (2006).\n\nReference:\nPanella, B., Hirscher, M., & Roth, S. (2006).
