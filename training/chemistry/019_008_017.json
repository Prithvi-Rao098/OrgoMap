    "message_2": "To calculate the standard electrode potential for the given reaction, we need to determine the reduction and oxidation half-reactions. \n\nThe given half-reactions are:\n1. Ag+ (aq) + e- → Ag (s) with a standard electrode potential of 0.80 V (reduction)\n2. Cu2+ (aq) + 2e- → Cu (s) with a standard electrode potential of 0.34 V (reduction)\n\nWe need to reverse the second half-reaction to make it an oxidation reaction:\nCu (s) → Cu2+ (aq) + 2e- \n\nWhen we reverse the reaction, we also need to change the sign of the standard electrode potential:\n0.34 V becomes -0.34 V.\n\nNow, we can add the two half-reactions together:\nAg+ (aq) + e- → Ag (s)\nCu (s) → Cu2+ (aq) + 2e-\n\nThe overall reaction is:\nAg+ (aq) + Cu (s) → Ag (s) + Cu2+ (aq)\n\nTo find the standard electrode potential for the overall reaction, we add the standard electrode potentials of the two half-reactions:\n0.80 V + (-0.34 V) = 0.46 V\n\nThe standard electrode potential for the reaction Ag+ (aq) + Cu (s) → Ag (s) + Cu2+ (aq) is 0.46 V."
