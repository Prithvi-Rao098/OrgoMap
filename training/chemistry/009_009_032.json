    "message_2": "The specific radioisotopes used in a nuclear reactor to generate electricity through controlled nuclear fission are uranium-235 (U-235) and plutonium-239 (Pu-239). These isotopes are commonly used as fuel in nuclear power plants due to their ability to sustain a chain reaction.\n\nThe fission process is regulated to prevent overheating by using control rods, which are made of materials that can absorb neutrons, such as boron, cadmium, or hafnium. These control rods are inserted into the reactor core between the fuel rods containing the fissile material. By adjusting the position of the control rods, operators can control the number of neutrons available to sustain the chain reaction, thereby regulating the rate of fission and the heat generated.\n\nIn addition to control rods, nuclear reactors also employ coolant systems to transfer the heat generated by the fission process to a heat exchanger, where it is used to produce steam that drives turbines and generates electricity. The coolant, often water or a liquid metal like sodium, helps to maintain a stable temperature within the reactor core and prevent overheating.\n\nIn summary, the specific radioisotopes used in nuclear reactors for electricity generation are uranium-235 and plutonium-239, and the fission process is regulated by using control rods and coolant systems to prevent overheating."
