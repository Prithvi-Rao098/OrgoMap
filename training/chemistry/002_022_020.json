    "message_2": "To calculate the lattice energy of MgO, we can use the Born-Lande equation:\n\nLattice energy (U) = (N * A * (1 - 1/n) * e^2 * |Z+| * |Z-|) / (4πε₀ * r₀)\n\nWhere:\n- N is the Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23 mol^-1)\n- A is the Madelung constant (for MgO, A ≈ 1.748)\n- n is the Born exponent (for MgO, n ≈ 9)\n- e is the elementary charge (1.602 x 10^-19 C)\n- Z+ and Z- are the charges of the cations and anions, respectively (for MgO, Z+ = 2 and Z- = -2)\n- ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity (8.854 x 10^-12 C² N^-1 m^-2)\n- r₀ is the distance between the ions (2.1 Å, which is equivalent to 2.1 x 10^-10 m)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the lattice energy:\n\nU = (6.022 x 10^23 * 1.748 * (1 - 1/9) * (1.602 x 10^-19)^2 * 2 * 2) / (4π * 8.854 x 10^-12 * 2.1 x 10^-10)\nU ≈ (6.022 x 10^23 * 1.748 * (8/9) * (2.566 x 10^-38) * 4) / (1.112 x 10^-10)\nU ≈ (1.052 x 10^-9) / (1.112 x 10^-10)\nU ≈ 9.46 x 10^3 J/mol\n\nThe lattice energy of MgO is approximately 9,460 J/mol."
