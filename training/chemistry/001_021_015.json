    "message_2": "The major product of this elimination reaction is an alkene. The reaction is an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction, where the KOH acts as a strong base to abstract a proton from the CH3CH2CH2Br, leading to the formation of a double bond and the elimination of the bromide ion. The major product is:\n\nCH2=CHCH3 (propene)"
