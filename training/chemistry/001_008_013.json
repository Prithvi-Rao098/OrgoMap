    "message_2": "When 2-methyl-1-pentanol is treated with concentrated sulfuric acid, it undergoes dehydration reaction to form an alkene. The major product of this reaction will be the more stable alkene, which is formed according to Zaitsev's rule (the more substituted alkene is the major product). In this case, the major product will be 2-methyl-2-pentene."
