    "message_2": "Octahedral coordination compounds exhibit various types of isomerism, including:\n\n1. Geometrical isomerism: This type of isomerism arises due to the different possible arrangements of ligands around the central metal atom in the octahedral complex. In octahedral complexes, geometrical isomerism can be observed in the form of cis and trans isomers.\n\nExample: [Co(NH3)4Cl2]^+ complex\n- Cis isomer: The two Cl ligands are adjacent to each other.\n- Trans isomer: The two Cl ligands are opposite to each other.\n\n2. Optical isomerism: Optical isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other and can rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions. Optical isomerism is observed in octahedral complexes when they have an asymmetric arrangement of ligands.\n\nExample: [Co(en)2Cl2]^+ complex (where en = ethylenediamine)\n- Δ-isomer: The complex rotates plane-polarized light in a clockwise direction (dextrorotatory).\n- Λ-isomer: The complex rotates plane-polarized light in a counterclockwise direction (levorotatory).\n\n3. Linkage isomerism: This type of isomerism occurs when a ligand can bind to the central metal atom through different donor atoms.\n\nExample: [Co(NH3)5(NO2)]^2+ complex\n- Nitro isomer: The NO2 ligand is bound to the Co atom through the nitrogen atom.\n- Nitrito isomer: The NO2 ligand is bound to the Co atom through one of the oxygen atoms.\n\n4. Coordination isomerism: Coordination isomerism occurs in complexes containing two or more different metal atoms and ligands that can interchange their positions between the coordination spheres of the metal atoms.\n\nExample: [Co(NH3)6][Cr(CN)6] complex\n- In this complex, the ligands (NH3 and CN) can interchange their positions between the coordination spheres of Co and Cr, resulting in different coordination isomers.\n\n5. Ionization isomerism: Ionization isomers have the same composition but differ in the ions that are formed when the complex is dissolved in water.\n\nExample: [Co(NH3)5Br]SO4 and [Co(NH3)5SO4]Br complexes\n- In the first complex, the counterion is SO4^2-, while in the second complex, the counterion is Br^-."
