    "message_2": "To calculate the rate of diffusion of helium gas in air, we can use Graham's law of diffusion, which states that the rate of diffusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molar mass. The formula for Graham's law is:\n\nRate₁ / Rate₂ = √(M₂ / M₁)\n\nwhere Rate₁ and Rate₂ are the rates of diffusion of two gases, and M₁ and M₂ are their respective molar masses.\n\nIn this case, we want to find the rate of diffusion of helium (He) in air. Air is primarily composed of nitrogen (N₂) and oxygen (O₂), with molar masses of 28 g/mol and 32 g/mol, respectively. We can approximate the molar mass of air as the average of nitrogen and oxygen, which is:\n\nM_air ≈ (28 g/mol + 32 g/mol) / 2 = 30 g/mol\n\nThe molar mass of helium (He) is 4 g/mol. Now we can use Graham's law to find the rate of diffusion of helium in air:\n\nRate_He / Rate_air = √(M_air / M_He)\n\nLet's assume the rate of diffusion of air is 1 (this is just a reference value, as we are interested in the relative rate of helium compared to air). Then:\n\nRate_He / 1 = √(30 g/mol / 4 g/mol)\n\nRate_He = √(7.5)\n\nRate_He ≈ 2.74\n\nSo, the rate of diffusion of helium gas in air at 25°C and a pressure of 1 atm is approximately 2.74 times faster than the rate of diffusion of air."
