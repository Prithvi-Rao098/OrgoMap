    "message_2": "To determine the mass of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine that can be obtained from the reaction, we will first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nN2H4 + C6H3Cl(NO2)2 → C6H3(NO2)2N2H3 + HCl\n\nNext, we need to find the molar mass of hydrazine (N2H4) and 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (C6H3(NO2)2N2H3).\n\nMolar mass of hydrazine (N2H4) = (2 × 14.01) + (4 × 1.01) = 32.05 g/mol\nMolar mass of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (C6H3(NO2)2N2H3) = (6 × 12.01) + (3 × 1.01) + (4 × 14.01) + (6 × 16.00) + (3 × 1.01) = 198.14 g/mol\n\nNow, we will use the stoichiometry of the balanced equation to determine the mass of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine that can be obtained from 10 grams of hydrazine.\n\nFirst, convert the mass of hydrazine to moles:\n10 g N2H4 × (1 mol N2H4 / 32.05 g N2H4) = 0.312 moles N2H4\n\nAccording to the balanced equation, 1 mole of hydrazine reacts to produce 1 mole of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine. Therefore, the moles of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine produced are equal to the moles of hydrazine used.\n\n0.312 moles N2H4 × (1 mol C6H3(NO2)2N2H3 / 1 mol N2H4) = 0.312 moles C6H3(NO2)2N2H3\n\nNow, convert the moles of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine to mass:\n0.312 moles C6H3(NO2)2N2H3 × (198.14 g C6H3(NO2)2N2H3 / 1 mol C6H3(NO2)2N2H3) = 61.80 g C6H3(NO2)2N2H3\n\nTherefore, the mass of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine that can be obtained from the reaction of 10 grams of hydrazine with excess 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene is approximately 61.80 grams."
