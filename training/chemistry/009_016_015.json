    "message_2": "To calculate the energy of a gamma-ray photon, we can use the formula:\n\nE = h * f\n\nwhere E is the energy of the photon, h is Planck's constant (6.63 x 10^-34 Js), and f is the frequency of the photon (1.25 x 10^19 Hz).\n\nE = (6.63 x 10^-34 Js) * (1.25 x 10^19 Hz)\n\nE = 8.2875 x 10^-15 J\n\nThe energy of the gamma-ray photon is approximately 8.29 x 10^-15 joules."
