    "message_2": "Methanoic acid, also known as formic acid, has the molecular formula HCOOH. Its structure consists of a central carbon atom bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a carbonyl group (C=O). The hydroxyl group contains an acidic hydrogen atom, which can be donated as a proton (H+) in aqueous solutions.\n\nBased on its molecular structure and bonding, methanoic acid is predicted to be acidic. The oxygen atom in the hydroxyl group is more electronegative than the hydrogen atom, creating a polar bond. This polar bond makes it easier for the hydrogen atom to be donated as a proton, resulting in the formation of the formate ion (HCOO-) and a hydronium ion (H3O+).\n\nThe acidity of methanoic acid can also be explained by resonance stabilization of the formate ion. When the acidic hydrogen is donated, the negative charge on the oxygen atom in the formate ion can be delocalized between the two oxygen atoms through resonance, which stabilizes the ion and makes it more likely for the acid to donate a proton.\n\nIn summary, based on its molecular structure and bonding, methanoic acid is predicted to be acidic."
