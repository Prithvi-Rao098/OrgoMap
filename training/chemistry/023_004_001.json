    "message_2": "To determine the maximum yield of acetylsalicylic acid, we need to first find the limiting reactant in the reaction between acetic anhydride and salicylic acid. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nC4H6O3 (acetic anhydride) + C7H6O3 (salicylic acid) â†’ C9H8O4 (acetylsalicylic acid) + C2H4O2 (acetic acid)\n\nThe molar mass of acetic anhydride (C4H6O3) is 102.09 g/mol, and the molar mass of salicylic acid (C7H6O3) is 138.12 g/mol. \n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of each reactant to moles:\n\nmoles of acetic anhydride = 10 g / 102.09 g/mol = 0.0979 mol\nmoles of salicylic acid = 6 g / 138.12 g/mol = 0.0434 mol\n\nNow, we need to determine the mole ratio of acetic anhydride to salicylic acid:\n\nmole ratio = moles of acetic anhydride / moles of salicylic acid = 0.0979 mol / 0.0434 mol = 2.26\n\nSince the balanced equation requires a 1:1 ratio of acetic anhydride to salicylic acid, salicylic acid is the limiting reactant in this reaction.\n\nNow, we can calculate the maximum yield of acetylsalicylic acid (C9H8O4) using the moles of the limiting reactant (salicylic acid). The molar mass of acetylsalicylic acid is 180.16 g/mol.\n\nmaximum yield of acetylsalicylic acid = moles of salicylic acid * molar mass of acetylsalicylic acid\n= 0.0434 mol * 180.16 g/mol = 7.82 g\n\nTherefore, the maximum yield of acetylsalicylic acid that can be obtained from the reaction is 7.82 grams."
