    "message_2": "The primary structure of a protein refers to the linear sequence of amino acids that make up the polypeptide chain. It is the most basic level of protein structure and is determined by the specific order of amino acids encoded by the corresponding gene. Each amino acid is connected to its neighbor through a covalent bond called a peptide bond, which forms between the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of the next.\n\nThe primary structure is crucial for the overall structure and function of the protein because it determines the way the polypeptide chain folds and interacts with other molecules. The amino acid sequence influences the formation of secondary structures, such as alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which in turn contribute to the formation of the tertiary structure, or the overall three-dimensional shape of the protein. The tertiary structure is essential for the protein's function, as it determines the protein's stability, its interactions with other molecules, and its catalytic activity (if it is an enzyme).\n\nAny change in the primary structure, such as a mutation that alters the amino acid sequence, can potentially affect the protein's folding, stability, and function. Some changes may have little to no impact on the protein's function, while others can lead to loss of function or even the formation of misfolded proteins that can aggregate and cause diseases, such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's.\n\nIn summary, the primary structure of a protein is the linear sequence of amino acids that make up the polypeptide chain, and it plays a critical role in determining the overall structure and function of the protein by influencing its folding, stability, and interactions with other molecules."
