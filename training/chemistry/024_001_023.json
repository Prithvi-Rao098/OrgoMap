    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a question for a chemistry student to solve:\n\nDesign a continuous-flow stirred tank reactor (CSTR) for the exothermic reaction A + B → C, which follows first-order kinetics. The reaction rate constant is 0.02 min^-1, and the heat of reaction is -50 kJ/mol. The feed stream contains reactant A at a concentration of 2 mol/L and reactant B at 1 mol/L, with a total flow rate of 2 L/min. The reactor should have a residence time of 5 min and maintain an operating temperature of 30°C. Determine the reactor volume and cooling/heating requirements to maintain the desired temperature.",
    "message_2": "To design the CSTR, we first need to determine the reactor volume. We can do this by using the residence time and the flow rate:\n\nResidence time (τ) = 5 min\nFlow rate (Q) = 2 L/min\n\nReactor volume (V) = τ * Q\nV = 5 min * 2 L/min = 10 L\n\nNow that we have the reactor volume, we can determine the cooling/heating requirements. First, we need to find the reaction rate (r) using the first-order kinetics:\n\nReaction rate constant (k) = 0.02 min^-1\nConcentration of A (C_A) = 2 mol/L\nConcentration of B (C_B) = 1 mol/L\n\nReaction rate (r) = k * C_A * C_B\nr = 0.02 min^-1 * 2 mol/L * 1 mol/L = 0.04 mol/(L*min)\n\nNext, we need to find the heat generation rate (Q_gen) using the heat of reaction:\n\nHeat of reaction (ΔH) = -50 kJ/mol\n\nHeat generation rate (Q_gen) = r * V * ΔH\nQ_gen = 0.04 mol/(L*min) * 10 L * (-50 kJ/mol) = -20 kJ/min\n\nSince the reaction is exothermic (negative heat of reaction), the heat generation rate is negative, which means we need to remove heat from the reactor to maintain the desired temperature of 30°C. Therefore, the cooling requirement is 20 kJ/min."
