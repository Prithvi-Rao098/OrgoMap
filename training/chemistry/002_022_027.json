    "message_2": "To calculate the lattice energy of CaCl2, we can use the Born-Lande equation:\n\nLattice energy (U) = -A * (1 - 1/n) * (Q1 * Q2 / r)\n\nWhere:\nA = Born-Lande equation constant = 2.21 x 10^-19 J nm\nn = Born exponent (typically between 5 and 12, we will use 9 as an approximation for ionic compounds)\nQ1 = charge of ion 1 (Ca2+) = +2\nQ2 = charge of ion 2 (Cl-) = -1\nr = distance between ions = 0.231 nm\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the equation:\n\nU = - (2.21 x 10^-19 J nm) * (1 - 1/9) * ((+2) * (-1) / 0.231 nm)\n\nU = - (2.21 x 10^-19 J nm) * (8/9) * (-2 / 0.231 nm)\n\nU = (2.21 x 10^-19 J nm) * (8/9) * (2 / 0.231 nm)\n\nU = 1.96 x 10^-19 J\n\nThe lattice energy of CaCl2 is approximately 1.96 x 10^-19 J."
