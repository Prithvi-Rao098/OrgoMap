    "message_1": "What is the theoretical yield of nylon-6,6 that can be produced from the reaction of 10 grams of adipic acid and 10 grams of hexamethylenediamine, assuming no side reactions occur and all reactants are completely consumed?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the theoretical yield of nylon-6,6, we first need to determine the limiting reactant in the reaction between adipic acid and hexamethylenediamine. We can do this by comparing the moles of each reactant.\n\nThe molecular weight of adipic acid (C6H10O4) is:\n(6 x 12.01) + (10 x 1.01) + (4 x 16.00) = 146.14 g/mol\n\nThe molecular weight of hexamethylenediamine (C6H16N2) is:\n(6 x 12.01) + (16 x 1.01) + (2 x 14.01) = 116.21 g/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the moles of each reactant:\nmoles of adipic acid = 10 g / 146.14 g/mol = 0.0684 mol\nmoles of hexamethylenediamine = 10 g / 116.21 g/mol = 0.0860 mol\n\nThe stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, so the limiting reactant is adipic acid since it has fewer moles.\n\nNow, we can calculate the theoretical yield of nylon-6,6. The molecular weight of nylon-6,6 (C12H22N2O2) is:\n(12 x 12.01) + (22 x 1.01) + (2 x 14.01) + (2 x 16.00) = 226.32 g/mol\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, the moles of nylon-6,6 produced will be equal to the moles of the limiting reactant, adipic acid.\n\nmoles of nylon-6,6 = 0.0684 mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the mass of nylon-6,6 produced:\nmass of nylon-6,6 = 0.0684 mol x 226.32 g/mol = 15.47 g\n\nThe theoretical yield of nylon-6,6 that can be produced from the reaction of 10 grams of adipic acid and 10 grams of hexamethylenediamine is 15.47 grams."
