    "message_2": "The bond length between two hydrogen atoms in a hydrogen molecule (H2) can be determined by considering the atomic radius of hydrogen. Since the atomic radius of hydrogen is given as 37 pm (picometers), the bond length can be calculated as follows:\n\nBond length = 2 * atomic radius\nBond length = 2 * 37 pm\nBond length = 74 pm\n\nSo, the bond length between two hydrogen atoms in a hydrogen molecule (H2) is 74 pm. Note that the bond energy of H2 (436 kJ/mol) is not needed to calculate the bond length in this case."
