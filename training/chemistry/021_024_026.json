    "message_2": "Molecular orbital theory is a method for describing the electronic structure of molecules using quantum mechanics. In this theory, atomic orbitals from individual atoms combine to form molecular orbitals, which are associated with the entire molecule rather than a single atom. The molecular orbitals can be classified as bonding, non-bonding, or anti-bonding based on their energy levels and electron distribution.\n\nFor the H2 molecule, we have two hydrogen atoms, each with one electron in the 1s orbital. When these two atoms come together to form a molecule, their atomic orbitals combine to form two molecular orbitals: one bonding (σ1s) and one anti-bonding (σ1s*).\n\nThe bonding molecular orbital (σ1s) is lower in energy than the atomic orbitals and has a greater electron density between the two nuclei, which leads to an attractive force and bond formation. The anti-bonding molecular orbital (σ1s*) is higher in energy and has a node between the nuclei, leading to a repulsive force.\n\nTo calculate the bond order, we use the following formula:\n\nBond order = (Number of electrons in bonding orbitals - Number of electrons in anti-bonding orbitals) / 2\n\nFor H2, there are two electrons in the bonding orbital (σ1s) and none in the anti-bonding orbital (σ1s*). So, the bond order is:\n\nBond order = (2 - 0) / 2 = 1\n\nThe bond order of H2 is 1, which indicates that there is a single bond between the two hydrogen atoms. A bond order of 1 or higher generally indicates that the molecule is stable, while a bond order of less than 1 indicates that the molecule is unstable and unlikely to exist. In the case of H2, the bond order of 1 suggests that the molecule is stable, and indeed, H2 is a stable diatomic molecule at room temperature and pressure."
