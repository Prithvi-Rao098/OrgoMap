    "message_2": "The net energy yield during the conversion of glucose to pyruvate in glycolysis is 2 ATP molecules per glucose molecule. Glycolysis is a series of 10 enzyme-catalyzed reactions that occur in the cytoplasm of the cell. The process can be divided into two main phases: the energy investment phase and the energy generation phase.\n\nHere are the detailed steps involved in glycolysis:\n\nEnergy Investment Phase:\n\n1. Hexokinase: Glucose is phosphorylated by hexokinase, using one ATP molecule to form glucose-6-phosphate. This step consumes one ATP molecule.\n\n2. Phosphoglucose isomerase: Glucose-6-phosphate is converted to fructose-6-phosphate.\n\n3. Phosphofructokinase: Fructose-6-phosphate is phosphorylated by phosphofructokinase, using another ATP molecule to form fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. This step consumes one more ATP molecule.\n\n4. Aldolase: Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is cleaved into two three-carbon molecules, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP).\n\n5. Triose phosphate isomerase: DHAP is converted to G3P, resulting in two G3P molecules.\n\nEnergy Generation Phase:\n\n6. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase: Each G3P molecule is oxidized and phosphorylated to form 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3-BPG). This step generates two NADH molecules (one per G3P).\n\n7. Phosphoglycerate kinase: Each 1,3-BPG molecule transfers a phosphate group to ADP, forming ATP and 3-phosphoglycerate. This step generates two ATP molecules (one per 1,3-BPG).\n\n8. Phosphoglycerate mutase: Each 3-phosphoglycerate molecule is converted to 2-phosphoglycerate.\n\n9. Enolase: Each 2-phosphoglycerate molecule is dehydrated to form phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP).\n\n10. Pyruvate kinase: Each PEP molecule transfers a phosphate group to ADP, forming ATP and pyruvate. This step generates two more ATP molecules (one per PEP).\n\nIn summary, the energy investment phase consumes 2 ATP molecules, while the energy generation phase produces 4 ATP molecules. Therefore, the net energy yield of glycolysis is 2 ATP molecules per glucose molecule (4 produced - 2 consumed). Additionally, 2 NADH molecules are generated during the process, which can be further used in the electron transport chain to produce more ATP."
