    "message_2": "The standard electrode potential of a half-cell is the same as its standard reduction potential when the half-cell is written as a reduction reaction. In this case, the standard reduction potential of the Zn/Zn2+ half-cell is given as -0.76 V. Therefore, the standard electrode potential of the Zn/Zn2+ half-cell at 25°C is also -0.76 V."
