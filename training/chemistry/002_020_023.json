    "message_2": "The type of inorganic solid formed between a metal and a non-metal is called an ionic solid or an ionic compound. In ionic solids, the metal atoms lose electrons to form positively charged ions (cations), while the non-metal atoms gain electrons to form negatively charged ions (anions). These ions are held together by strong electrostatic forces of attraction, known as ionic bonds.\n\nIonic solids differ from the type of inorganic solid formed between two non-metals, which are called covalent solids or molecular solids. In covalent solids, the non-metal atoms share electrons to form covalent bonds. These solids are usually characterized by low melting and boiling points, and they are generally poor conductors of heat and electricity.\n\nIonic solids also differ from the type of inorganic solid formed between metal atoms, which are called metallic solids. In metallic solids, the metal atoms are bonded together by a sea of delocalized electrons, which are free to move throughout the solid. This delocalization of electrons results in strong metallic bonds, giving metallic solids their characteristic properties such as high electrical and thermal conductivity, malleability, and ductility.\n\nExamples:\n1. Ionic solid: Sodium chloride (NaCl) is an example of an ionic solid formed between the metal sodium (Na) and the non-metal chlorine (Cl). In this compound, sodium loses one electron to form a positively charged ion (Na+), while chlorine gains one electron to form a negatively charged ion (Cl-). The resulting ionic compound has a high melting point and is a good conductor of electricity when dissolved in water or in a molten state.\n\n2. Covalent solid: Carbon dioxide (CO2) is an example of a covalent solid formed between two non-metals, carbon (C) and oxygen (O). In this compound, carbon and oxygen atoms share electrons to form covalent bonds. Carbon dioxide has a low melting and boiling point and is a poor conductor of heat and electricity.\n\n3. Metallic solid: Copper (Cu) is an example of a metallic solid formed between metal atoms. In copper, the metal atoms are bonded together by a sea of delocalized electrons, which allows it to conduct electricity and heat efficiently. Copper is also malleable and ductile, allowing it to be shaped into wires and sheets."
