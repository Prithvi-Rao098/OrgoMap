    "message_2": "The effect of temperature on the rate of reaction between hydrochloric acid and magnesium ribbon can be explained using the collision theory. As the temperature increases, the kinetic energy of the particles (molecules and ions) also increases. This leads to more frequent and energetic collisions between the reacting particles, in this case, the hydrochloric acid (HCl) and magnesium (Mg) atoms.\n\nWhen the temperature is increased, the rate of reaction between hydrochloric acid and magnesium ribbon generally increases. This is because the higher temperature provides the particles with more energy, allowing them to move faster and collide more often. Additionally, a greater proportion of these collisions will have enough energy to overcome the activation energy barrier, leading to a faster rate of reaction.\n\nIn summary, increasing the temperature will increase the rate of reaction between hydrochloric acid and magnesium ribbon due to more frequent and energetic collisions between the reacting particles."
