    "message_2": "To determine the bond order of the O2 molecule using molecular orbital theory, we first need to consider the electronic configuration of oxygen. Oxygen has 8 electrons, so an O2 molecule has a total of 16 electrons. According to molecular orbital theory, these electrons will fill the molecular orbitals in order of increasing energy.\n\nThe molecular orbitals for O2 are filled in the following order:\n1. σ1s (2 electrons)\n2. σ*1s (2 electrons)\n3. σ2s (2 electrons)\n4. σ*2s (2 electrons)\n5. σ2pz (2 electrons)\n6. π2px and π2py (4 electrons)\n7. π*2px and π*2py (2 electrons)\n\nNow, we can calculate the bond order using the formula:\n\nBond order = (Number of electrons in bonding orbitals - Number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\n\nIn the case of O2:\nBond order = (10 - 6) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2\n\nSo, the bond order of the O2 molecule is 2.\n\nA bond order of 2 indicates that there is a double bond between the two oxygen atoms in the O2 molecule. This double bond results in a relatively strong bond strength, which contributes to the stability of the O2 molecule. The presence of two unpaired electrons in the π*2px and π*2py antibonding orbitals also makes O2 a paramagnetic molecule. Overall, the bond strength and stability of the O2 molecule can be attributed to its molecular orbital configuration and the resulting bond order of 2."
