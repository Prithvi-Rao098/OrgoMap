    "message_1": "Sure, here is a precise problem:\n\nCalculate the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the following chemical reaction at 25°C, given the initial concentrations of each reactant and product: \n\n2NO(g) + O2(g) ⇌ 2NO2(g)\n\nInitial concentrations: [NO] = 0.05 M, [O2] = 0.03 M, [NO2] = 0.00 M. \n\nThe student will need to use the equilibrium constant expression and solve for Kc using the provided concentrations.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to write the equilibrium constant expression for the given reaction:\n\nKc = [NO2]^2 / ([NO]^2 * [O2])\n\nNext, we need to determine the changes in the concentrations of the reactants and products at equilibrium. Let's use x to represent the change in concentration:\n\nAt equilibrium:\n[NO2] = 2x\n[NO] = 0.05 - x\n[O2] = 0.03 - x\n\nNow, we can substitute these equilibrium concentrations into the Kc expression:\n\nKc = (2x)^2 / ((0.05 - x)^2 * (0.03 - x))\n\nSince we are not given the value of Kc, we cannot solve for x directly. However, we can use the ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table and the given initial concentrations to set up the problem for the student to solve. The student will need to be given the value of Kc or additional information to determine the equilibrium concentrations and calculate Kc."
