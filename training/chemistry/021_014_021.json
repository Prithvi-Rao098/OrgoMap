    "message_2": "The VSEPR geometry of a molecule with a central atom having four electron domains, with two of them being lone pairs, is bent or angular. The two lone pairs and two bonding pairs of electrons around the central atom result in a bent molecular geometry due to the repulsion between the electron pairs."
