    "message_1": "What is the balanced chemical equation for the combustion of propane (C3H8), and what is the volume of oxygen gas (O2) required for complete combustion if 10 grams of propane are burned?",
    "message_2": "The balanced chemical equation for the combustion of propane (C3H8) is:\n\nC3H8 + 5O2 → 3CO2 + 4H2O\n\nTo find the volume of oxygen gas (O2) required for complete combustion of 10 grams of propane, we first need to determine the number of moles of propane and then use stoichiometry to find the moles of oxygen gas required.\n\nThe molar mass of propane (C3H8) is:\n(3 × 12.01 g/mol for C) + (8 × 1.01 g/mol for H) = 44.09 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the moles of propane:\nmoles of propane = mass of propane / molar mass of propane\nmoles of propane = 10 g / 44.09 g/mol = 0.2268 moles\n\nFrom the balanced chemical equation, we can see that 1 mole of propane requires 5 moles of oxygen gas for complete combustion. Therefore, we can find the moles of oxygen gas required:\n\nmoles of O2 = moles of propane × (5 moles O2 / 1 mole C3H8)\nmoles of O2 = 0.2268 moles × 5 = 1.134 moles\n\nNow, we can use the ideal gas law to find the volume of oxygen gas required at standard temperature and pressure (STP). At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters. Therefore:\n\nvolume of O2 = moles of O2 × volume per mole at STP\nvolume of O2 = 1.134 moles × 22.4 L/mol = 25.4 liters\n\nSo, the volume of oxygen gas (O2) required for complete combustion of 10 grams of propane is approximately 25.4 liters."
