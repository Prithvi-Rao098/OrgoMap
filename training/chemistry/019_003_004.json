    "message_2": "To calculate the heat capacity of 20 grams of water heated from 25°C to 50°C, we can use the formula:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the heat capacity, m is the mass of the water, c is the specific heat capacity of water, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nThe specific heat capacity of water is 4.18 J/(g·°C).\n\nGiven:\nm = 20 grams\nΔT = 50°C - 25°C = 25°C\nc = 4.18 J/(g·°C)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nQ = (20 g) × (4.18 J/(g·°C)) × (25°C)\nQ = 20 × 4.18 × 25\nQ = 2090 J\n\nSo, the heat capacity of 20 grams of water heated from 25°C to 50°C is 2090 Joules."
