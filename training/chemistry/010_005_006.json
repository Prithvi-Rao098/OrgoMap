    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction, we first need to determine the standard cell potential (E°) for the reaction. The standard cell potential can be calculated using the standard reduction potentials of the two half-reactions:\n\nE°(cell) = E°(cathode) - E°(anode)\n\nGiven the standard reduction potentials of A2+ (0.34 V) and D2+ (-0.74 V), we can identify the cathode and anode half-reactions:\n\nCathode: A2+ + 2e- → A (E° = 0.34 V)\nAnode: D → D2+ + 2e- (E° = 0.74 V, since the reduction potential is -0.74 V)\n\nNow we can calculate the standard cell potential:\n\nE°(cell) = 0.34 V - (-0.74 V) = 1.08 V\n\nNext, we can use the Nernst equation to relate the cell potential (E) at 25°C to the standard cell potential (E°) and the reaction quotient (Q):\n\nE = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\n\nAt equilibrium, E = 0.60 V, and Q = Kc. We can rearrange the Nernst equation to solve for Kc:\n\n0.60 V = 1.08 V - (RT/nF) * ln(Kc)\n\nLet's plug in the values for R (8.314 J/mol·K), T (298 K), n (2, since there are 2 electrons transferred in the reaction), and F (96,485 C/mol):\n\n0.60 V = 1.08 V - ((8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K) / (2 * 96,485 C/mol)) * ln(Kc)\n\nSolving for Kc:\n\nln(Kc) = (1.08 V - 0.60 V) * (2 * 96,485 C/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K)\nln(Kc) ≈ 10.61\n\nNow, we can find Kc by taking the exponent of both sides:\n\nKc = e^(10.61) ≈ 40500\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction at 25°C is approximately 40,500."
