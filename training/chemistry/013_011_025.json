    "message_2": "The critical micelle concentration (CMC) of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in water is the concentration at which SDS molecules start to aggregate and form micelles. The CMC of SDS in water is typically around 8-10 mM (millimolar) at room temperature (25Â°C). However, it is important to note that the CMC can vary depending on factors such as temperature, ionic strength, and the presence of other solutes.\n\nAs for the temperature dependence, the CMC of SDS generally decreases with increasing temperature. This is because the hydrophobic effect, which drives micelle formation, becomes stronger at higher temperatures. The exact relationship between temperature and CMC can be complex and may not be linear, but in general, you can expect the CMC to decrease as the temperature increases.\n\nTo determine the CMC of SDS in water at a specific temperature, you can refer to published experimental data or perform experiments using techniques such as surface tension measurements, conductivity measurements, or fluorescence spectroscopy."
