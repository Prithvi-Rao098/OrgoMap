    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of energy required to melt 50 grams of ice at 0°C, we first need to determine the number of moles of ice present. The molar mass of water (H2O) is 18.015 g/mol.\n\nNumber of moles = mass / molar mass\nNumber of moles = 50 g / 18.015 g/mol = 2.776 moles\n\nNow, we can use the enthalpy of fusion for water (6.01 kJ/mol) to calculate the energy required to melt the ice.\n\nEnergy required = number of moles × enthalpy of fusion\nEnergy required = 2.776 moles × 6.01 kJ/mol = 16.68 kJ\n\nTherefore, 16.68 kJ of energy is required to melt 50 grams of ice at 0°C."
