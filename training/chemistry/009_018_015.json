    "message_2": "There are several common radioisotopes used in medical applications, primarily for diagnostic imaging and therapy. Some of the most frequently used radioisotopes include:\n\n1. Technetium-99m (Tc-99m): This is the most widely used radioisotope in medical imaging, particularly for nuclear medicine scans. Tc-99m is produced by irradiating a molybdenum-98 (Mo-98) target with neutrons in a nuclear reactor, which forms molybdenum-99 (Mo-99). Mo-99 then decays to Tc-99m through a process called beta decay.\n\n2. Iodine-131 (I-131): I-131 is used for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, particularly in the treatment of thyroid disorders. It is produced by irradiating a tellurium-130 (Te-130) target with neutrons in a nuclear reactor, which forms tellurium-131 (Te-131). Te-131 then decays to I-131 through beta decay.\n\n3. Fluorine-18 (F-18): F-18 is commonly used in positron emission tomography (PET) scans, particularly for cancer diagnosis and monitoring. It is produced by irradiating a stable oxygen-18 (O-18) target with protons in a cyclotron, which forms F-18 through a process called proton-induced nuclear reaction.\n\n4. Gallium-67 (Ga-67): Ga-67 is used for diagnostic imaging, particularly in the detection of infections and tumors. It is produced by irradiating a stable zinc-68 (Zn-68) target with protons in a cyclotron, which forms Ga-67 through a process called proton-induced nuclear reaction.\n\n5. Thallium-201 (Tl-201): Tl-201 is used for diagnostic imaging, particularly in cardiac stress tests. It is produced by irradiating a stable thallium-203 (Tl-203) target with protons in a cyclotron, which forms Tl-201 through a process called proton-induced nuclear reaction.\n\n6. Yttrium-90 (Y-90): Y-90 is used for therapeutic purposes, particularly in the treatment of liver cancer. It is produced by irradiating a stable strontium-90 (Sr-90) target with neutrons in a nuclear reactor, which forms Y-90 through a process called neutron capture.\n\nThese radioisotopes are typically produced in specialized facilities, such as nuclear reactors or cyclotrons, and then transported to medical centers for use in diagnostic and therapeutic procedures."
