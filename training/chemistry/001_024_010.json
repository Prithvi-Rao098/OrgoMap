    "message_2": "To identify the functional group present in an unknown organic compound using IR spectroscopy, you need to analyze the IR spectrum of the compound and look for characteristic peaks that correspond to specific functional groups. Here are some common functional groups and their corresponding IR spectrum peaks:\n\n1. Alcohols and Phenols: Broad peak around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹ (O-H stretching)\n2. Carboxylic Acids: Broad peak around 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ (O-H stretching) and a sharp peak around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ (C=O stretching)\n3. Aldehydes: Peak around 2700-2900 cm⁻¹ (C-H stretching) and a sharp peak around 1700-1740 cm⁻¹ (C=O stretching)\n4. Ketones: Sharp peak around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹ (C=O stretching)\n5. Esters: Sharp peak around 1735-1750 cm⁻¹ (C=O stretching) and a peak around 1000-1300 cm⁻¹ (C-O stretching)\n6. Amides: Sharp peak around 1630-1690 cm⁻¹ (C=O stretching) and a peak around 3100-3500 cm⁻¹ (N-H stretching, if present)\n7. Amines: Peak around 3300-3500 cm⁻¹ (N-H stretching, if present) and a peak around 1000-1250 cm⁻¹ (C-N stretching)\n8. Nitriles: Sharp peak around 2210-2260 cm⁻¹ (C≡N stretching)\n9. Alkenes: Peak around 3000-3100 cm⁻¹ (C-H stretching) and a peak around 1600-1680 cm⁻¹ (C=C stretching)\n10. Alkynes: Peak around 3300 cm⁻¹ (C-H stretching, if terminal alkyne) and a peak around 2100-2250 cm⁻¹ (C≡C stretching)\n\nBy analyzing the IR spectrum of the unknown organic compound and correlating the observed peaks with the characteristic peaks mentioned above, you can identify the functional group(s) present in the compound. Keep in mind that some compounds may have multiple functional groups, so you may need to look for multiple characteristic peaks."
