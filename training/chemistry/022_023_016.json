    "message_2": "To find the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid, we can use the Ka expression and the formula for pH. The Ka expression for acetic acid is:\n\nKa = [H+][CH3COO-] / [CH3COOH]\n\nSince the initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.1 M, we can set up an equilibrium expression:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 = (x)(x) / (0.1 - x)\n\nHere, x represents the concentration of H+ ions. We can assume that x is much smaller than 0.1, so the expression simplifies to:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 = x^2 / 0.1\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx^2 = 1.8 x 10^-5 * 0.1\nx^2 = 1.8 x 10^-6\nx = √(1.8 x 10^-6)\nx ≈ 1.34 x 10^-3\n\nNow that we have the concentration of H+ ions, we can find the pH using the formula:\n\npH = -log[H+]\n\npH = -log(1.34 x 10^-3)\npH ≈ 2.87\n\nSo, the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid is approximately 2.87."
