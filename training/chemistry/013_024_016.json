    "message_2": "Detergents and cleaning agents affect the surface tension of water by reducing it. Surface tension is the force that holds water molecules together at the surface, creating a sort of \"skin\" on the water. This is due to the cohesive forces between water molecules, which result from hydrogen bonding.\n\nDetergents and cleaning agents are composed of molecules that have both hydrophilic (water-loving) and hydrophobic (water-repelling) parts. The hydrophilic part of the detergent molecule is attracted to water, while the hydrophobic part is repelled by water and attracted to oils, grease, and dirt. When detergents are added to water, they arrange themselves at the surface with their hydrophobic parts pointing away from the water and their hydrophilic parts interacting with the water molecules.\n\nThis arrangement disrupts the hydrogen bonding between water molecules at the surface, reducing the surface tension. The reduction in surface tension allows the water to spread out more easily and penetrate into small spaces, such as the pores and crevices of the material being cleaned. This increased wetting ability helps to lift and remove dirt, grease, and other contaminants from surfaces more effectively.\n\nIn addition, the hydrophobic part of the detergent molecule surrounds and encapsulates dirt and grease particles, forming small spheres called micelles. These micelles are then easily rinsed away with water, removing the dirt and grease from the surface.\n\nThe reduction of surface tension by detergents and cleaning agents is important in cleaning processes because it enhances the ability of water to wet surfaces and penetrate into small spaces, making it easier to remove dirt, grease, and other contaminants. This results in more effective and efficient cleaning, as well as reducing the amount of water and effort required for the process."
