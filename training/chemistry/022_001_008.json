    "message_2": "To balance the chemical equation, we need to ensure that the number of atoms for each element is the same on both sides of the equation.\n\nH2 + O2 -> H2O\n\nFirst, we notice that there are 2 hydrogen atoms on the left side of the equation and only 2 hydrogen atoms on the right side. However, there are 2 oxygen atoms on the left side and only 1 oxygen atom on the right side. To balance the equation, we can adjust the coefficients:\n\n2H2 + O2 -> 2H2O\n\nNow, the equation is balanced with 4 hydrogen atoms and 2 oxygen atoms on both sides.\n\nReactants: H2 (hydrogen gas) and O2 (oxygen gas)\nProducts: H2O (water)"
