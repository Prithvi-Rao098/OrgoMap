    "message_2": "The mechanism of the nucleophilic substitution reaction of benzylamine with ethyl iodide in the presence of a strong base involves the following steps:\n\n1. Deprotonation of benzylamine: The strong base (e.g., NaOH or KOH) abstracts the acidic hydrogen from the amine group of benzylamine, forming an amine anion (benzylamide anion) and a water molecule.\n\nBenzylamine + OH⁻ → Benzylamide anion + H₂O\n\n2. Nucleophilic attack: The benzylamide anion, which is a strong nucleophile, attacks the electrophilic carbon atom of ethyl iodide, displacing the iodide ion as a leaving group.\n\nBenzylamide anion + Ethyl iodide → N-benzylethylamine + I⁻\n\n3. Overall reaction: The overall reaction is the formation of N-benzylethylamine from benzylamine and ethyl iodide in the presence of a strong base.\n\nBenzylamine + Ethyl iodide + OH⁻ → N-benzylethylamine + I⁻ + H₂O\n\nThis reaction is an example of an S_N2 (bimolecular nucleophilic substitution) mechanism, where the nucleophile attacks the substrate in a single concerted step, leading to the inversion of stereochemistry at the electrophilic carbon center."
