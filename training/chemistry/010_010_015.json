    "message_1": "A galvanic cell has a standard emf of 1.10 V at 298 K. If this cell runs for 25 minutes with a constant current of 0.25 A, what is the amount of energy produced in joules? (Assume the cell is operating under standard conditions.)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of energy produced in the galvanic cell, we can use the formula:\n\nEnergy (E) = Voltage (V) × Charge (Q)\n\nFirst, we need to find the charge (Q) that has passed through the cell. We can do this using the formula:\n\nCharge (Q) = Current (I) × Time (t)\n\nGiven that the current (I) is 0.25 A and the time (t) is 25 minutes, we can convert the time to seconds:\n\nt = 25 minutes × 60 seconds/minute = 1500 seconds\n\nNow, we can find the charge (Q):\n\nQ = 0.25 A × 1500 s = 375 Coulombs\n\nNow that we have the charge, we can find the energy produced in the galvanic cell:\n\nEnergy (E) = Voltage (V) × Charge (Q)\nE = 1.10 V × 375 C = 412.5 Joules\n\nTherefore, the amount of energy produced in the galvanic cell is 412.5 Joules."
