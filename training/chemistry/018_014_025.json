    "message_1": "What is the order of reaction with respect to reactant A if the rate of reaction doubles when the concentration of A is doubled, while the concentration of reactant B remains constant?",
    "message_2": "The order of reaction with respect to reactant A is 1 (first order). This is because when the concentration of A is doubled, the rate of reaction also doubles, indicating a direct linear relationship between the concentration of A and the rate of reaction."
