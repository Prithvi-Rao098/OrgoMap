    "message_2": "When aqueous solutions of potassium iodide (KI) and lead(II) nitrate (Pb(NO3)2) are mixed together, a double replacement reaction occurs, resulting in the formation of lead(II) iodide (PbI2) and potassium nitrate (KNO3).\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\n2 KI (aq) + Pb(NO3)2 (aq) â†’ PbI2 (s) + 2 KNO3 (aq)\n\nThis is a type of precipitation reaction, as lead(II) iodide (PbI2) forms a solid precipitate when the two solutions are mixed."
