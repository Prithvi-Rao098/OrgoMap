    "message_2": "To calculate the heat of formation of propane (C3H8) using Hess's Law, we need to manipulate the given reactions to represent the formation of propane from its elements in their standard states. The target reaction is:\n\nC(s) + H2(g) → 1/2C3H8(g)\n\nFirst, we need to manipulate the given reactions:\n\n1. 2C(s) + 3H2(g) → C3H8(g) ∆H = -103.8 kJ/mol\nDivide this reaction by 2 to obtain 1 mole of C3H8:\nC(s) + 3/2H2(g) → 1/2C3H8(g) ∆H = -51.9 kJ/mol\n\n2. C(s) + O2(g) → CO2(g) ∆H = -393.5 kJ/mol\nThis reaction is fine as it is.\n\n3. H2(g) + 1/2O2(g) → H2O(l) ∆H = -285.8 kJ/mol\nMultiply this reaction by 3/2 to obtain 3 moles of H2O:\n3H2(g) + 3/2O2(g) → 3H2O(l) ∆H = -428.7 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can add the manipulated reactions together:\n\nC(s) + 3/2H2(g) → 1/2C3H8(g) ∆H = -51.9 kJ/mol\nC(s) + O2(g) → CO2(g) ∆H = -393.5 kJ/mol\n3H2(g) + 3/2O2(g) → 3H2O(l) ∆H = -428.7 kJ/mol\n----------------------------------------------\n2C(s) + 4H2(g) + O2(g) → 1/2C3H8(g) + CO2(g) + 3H2O(l) ∆H = -874.1 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we need to subtract the second and third reactions from the first one to isolate the target reaction:\n\n2C(s) + 4H2(g) + O2(g) → 1/2C3H8(g) + CO2(g) + 3H2O(l) ∆H = -874.1 kJ/mol\n- [C(s) + O2(g) → CO2(g) ∆H = -393.5 kJ/mol]\n- [3H2(g) + 3/2O2(g) → 3H2O(l) ∆H = -428.7 kJ/mol]\n----------------------------------------------\nC(s) + H2(g) → 1/2C3H8(g) ∆H = -51.9 kJ/mol\n\nThus, the heat of formation of propane (C3H8) is -51.9 kJ/mol."
