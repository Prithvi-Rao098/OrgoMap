    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the vaporization reaction of 25.0 g of water at 100°C and atmospheric pressure (1 atm), we need to use the following equation:\n\nΔH = m × ΔHvap\n\nwhere ΔH is the enthalpy change, m is the mass of water, and ΔHvap is the molar enthalpy of vaporization for water.\n\nThe molar enthalpy of vaporization for water at 100°C and 1 atm is 40.7 kJ/mol.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of water (25.0 g) to moles:\n\nmoles of water = mass of water / molar mass of water\nmoles of water = 25.0 g / 18.015 g/mol = 1.387 moles\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change:\n\nΔH = (1.387 moles) × (40.7 kJ/mol) = 56.5 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the vaporization reaction of 25.0 g of water at 100°C and atmospheric pressure (1 atm) is 56.5 kJ."
