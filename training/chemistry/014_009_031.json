    "message_2": "The coordination geometry of the complex [UO2(H2O)5]2+ is pentagonal bipyramidal. In this complex, the uranium atom (U) is at the center, and it is bonded to two oxygen atoms (O) in the axial positions, forming a linear U-O-U unit. The five water molecules (H2O) are coordinated to the uranium atom in the equatorial plane, forming a pentagonal arrangement.\n\nOn the other hand, the coordination geometry of the isoelectronic complex [Th(H2O)6]4+ is octahedral. In this complex, the thorium atom (Th) is at the center, and it is surrounded by six water molecules (H2O) in an octahedral arrangement.\n\nThe main difference between the coordination geometries of these two complexes is the number of ligands and the arrangement around the central metal atom. In [UO2(H2O)5]2+, there are seven ligands (two oxide ions and five water molecules) in a pentagonal bipyramidal arrangement, while in [Th(H2O)6]4+, there are six ligands (six water molecules) in an octahedral arrangement."
