    "message_2": "To calculate the change in enthalpy (ΔH) and entropy (ΔS) for the reaction, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation:\n\n2 H₂(g) + O₂(g) → 2 H₂O(g)\n\nNext, we need to find the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) and standard molar entropies (S°) for each substance involved in the reaction. These values can be found in tables or online databases. Here are the values we need:\n\nΔHf° (H₂) = 0 kJ/mol (since it is an element in its standard state)\nΔHf° (O₂) = 0 kJ/mol (since it is an element in its standard state)\nΔHf° (H₂O, g) = -241.8 kJ/mol\n\nS° (H₂) = 130.7 J/mol·K\nS° (O₂) = 205.2 J/mol·K\nS° (H₂O, g) = 188.8 J/mol·K\n\nNow we can calculate the change in enthalpy (ΔH) for the reaction using the following equation:\n\nΔH = Σ [ΔHf° (products)] - Σ [ΔHf° (reactants)]\n\nΔH = [2 × (-241.8 kJ/mol)] - [2 × 0 kJ/mol + 1 × 0 kJ/mol]\nΔH = -483.6 kJ\n\nThe change in enthalpy (ΔH) for the reaction is -483.6 kJ.\n\nNext, we can calculate the change in entropy (ΔS) for the reaction using the following equation:\n\nΔS = Σ [S° (products)] - Σ [S° (reactants)]\n\nΔS = [2 × 188.8 J/mol·K] - [2 × 130.7 J/mol·K + 1 × 205.2 J/mol·K]\nΔS = 377.6 J/mol·K - 466.6 J/mol·K\nΔS = -89.0 J/mol·K\n\nThe change in entropy (ΔS) for the reaction is -89.0 J/mol·K."
