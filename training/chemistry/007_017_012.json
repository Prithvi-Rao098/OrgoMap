    "message_2": "To effectively treat respiratory diseases such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a new compound must possess certain specific chemical properties. These properties will ensure that the compound can target the underlying causes of the diseases, alleviate symptoms, and minimize side effects. Some of the key chemical properties that a new compound should have include:\n\n1. Anti-inflammatory properties: Inflammation plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of asthma and COPD. A compound with anti-inflammatory properties can help reduce airway inflammation, thereby improving lung function and reducing symptoms.\n\n2. Bronchodilatory properties: A compound with bronchodilatory properties can help relax and widen the airways, making it easier for patients to breathe. This property is crucial for treating respiratory diseases characterized by bronchoconstriction, such as asthma and COPD.\n\n3. Selectivity: The compound should be selective for its target, meaning it should primarily act on the specific receptors or enzymes involved in the disease process. This will help minimize off-target effects and reduce the risk of side effects.\n\n4. Bioavailability: The compound should have good bioavailability, meaning it can be effectively absorbed and distributed within the body. This is important for ensuring that the compound reaches its target site in the lungs and exerts its therapeutic effects.\n\n5. Stability: The compound should be stable in the body and not degrade rapidly. This will ensure that it has a long-lasting effect and does not require frequent administration.\n\n6. Solubility: The compound should be soluble in water or other appropriate solvents, which will facilitate its formulation into inhalable or oral dosage forms.\n\n7. Low toxicity: The compound should have low toxicity and minimal side effects, making it safe for long-term use in patients with chronic respiratory diseases.\n\n8. Minimal drug interactions: The compound should have minimal interactions with other medications commonly used by patients with respiratory diseases, such as corticosteroids, beta-agonists, and anticholinergics. This will help reduce the risk of adverse drug interactions and improve patient safety.\n\nIn summary, a new compound for treating respiratory diseases such as asthma and COPD should have anti-inflammatory and bronchodilatory properties, be selective, have good bioavailability, be stable, soluble, have low toxicity, and minimal drug interactions. These properties will help ensure that the compound is effective in treating the disease, has minimal side effects, and can be safely used in combination with other medications."
