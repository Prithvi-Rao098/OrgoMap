    "message_1": "A chemistry student needs to determine the equilibrium concentrations of reactants and products for the following reaction:\n2 NOCl (g) ⇌ 2 NO (g) + Cl2 (g)\nThe initial concentration of NOCl is 0.50 M and the equilibrium constant, Kc = 4.68 x 10^-3. What are the equilibrium concentrations of NO and Cl2?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to keep track of the concentrations of the reactants and products.\n\nInitial concentrations:\n[NOCl] = 0.50 M\n[NO] = 0 M\n[Cl2] = 0 M\n\nChange in concentrations:\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is 2:2:1, for every 2 moles of NOCl that react, 2 moles of NO and 1 mole of Cl2 are produced. Let x be the change in concentration of NOCl.\n\n-2x (moles of NOCl are consumed)\n+2x (moles of NO are produced)\n+x (moles of Cl2 are produced)\n\nEquilibrium concentrations:\n[NOCl] = 0.50 - 2x\n[NO] = 2x\n[Cl2] = x\n\nNow we can use the equilibrium constant expression to solve for x:\n\nKc = [NO]^2 * [Cl2] / [NOCl]^2\n4.68 x 10^-3 = (2x)^2 * (x) / (0.50 - 2x)^2\n\nSolve for x:\n\n4.68 x 10^-3 * (0.50 - 2x)^2 = 4x^3\n0.00234 - 0.01872x + 0.03744x^2 = 4x^3\n\nRearrange the equation:\n\n4x^3 - 0.03744x^2 + 0.01872x - 0.00234 = 0\n\nSolving this cubic equation, we find that x ≈ 0.002 (ignoring the negative and non-physical solutions).\n\nNow we can find the equilibrium concentrations:\n\n[NOCl] = 0.50 - 2x ≈ 0.50 - 2(0.002) ≈ 0.496 M\n[NO] = 2x ≈ 2(0.002) ≈ 0.004 M\n[Cl2] = x ≈ 0.002 M\n\nSo, the equilibrium concentrations are approximately [NOCl] = 0.496 M, [NO] = 0.004 M, and [Cl2] = 0.002 M."
