    "message_2": "The synthesis of phenylalanine from benzyl chloride and ammonia can be represented by the following balanced chemical equation:\n\nC6H5CH2Cl + 2 NH3 â†’ C6H5CH2NH2 + NH4Cl\n\nIn this reaction, 1 mole of benzyl chloride (C6H5CH2Cl) reacts with 2 moles of ammonia (NH3) to produce 1 mole of phenylalanine (C6H5CH2NH2) and 1 mole of ammonium chloride (NH4Cl).\n\nTherefore, the exact stoichiometric ratio of benzyl chloride to ammonia required for the preparation of 1 mole of phenylalanine is 1:2, assuming complete conversion and a yield of 100%."
