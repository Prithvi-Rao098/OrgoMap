    "message_2": "To determine the equilibrium constant for the given redox reaction, we first need to find the overall cell potential (E°) for the reaction. \n\nThe given standard reduction potentials are:\n\nFe3+ + e- → Fe2+; E° = +0.771 V\nH2O2 + 2H+ + 2e- → 2H2O; E° = +1.78 V\n\nWe need to reverse the first half-reaction to match the overall redox reaction:\n\nFe2+ → Fe3+ + e-; E° = -0.771 V\n\nNow, we can add the two half-reactions to get the overall redox reaction:\n\nFe2+ + H2O2 + 2H+ → Fe3+ + 2H2O\n\nThe overall cell potential (E°) is the sum of the potentials of the two half-reactions:\n\nE° = -0.771 V + 1.78 V = 1.009 V\n\nNow we can use the Nernst equation to find the equilibrium constant (K):\n\nE° = (RT/nF) * ln(K)\n\nWhere:\nE° = 1.009 V (overall cell potential)\nR = 8.314 J/(mol·K) (gas constant)\nT = 25°C = 298.15 K (temperature)\nn = 2 (number of electrons transferred in the reaction)\nF = 96485 C/mol (Faraday's constant)\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for K:\n\nln(K) = (nF * E°) / (RT)\nK = e^((nF * E°) / (RT))\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nK = e^((2 * 96485 C/mol * 1.009 V) / (8.314 J/(mol·K) * 298.15 K))\n\nK ≈ e^(198,000 / 2470) ≈ e^80.2\n\nThe equilibrium constant K is approximately e^80.2, which is a very large number. This indicates that the reaction strongly favors the formation of Fe3+ and H2O."
