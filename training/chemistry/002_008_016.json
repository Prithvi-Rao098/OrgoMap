    "message_2": "To find the percent composition of sodium chloride (NaCl), we need to determine the mass of each element (sodium and chlorine) and then divide it by the total mass of the compound.\n\nFirst, we need to find the molar mass of each element:\n- Sodium (Na) has a molar mass of 22.99 g/mol.\n- Chlorine (Cl) has a molar mass of 35.45 g/mol.\n\nNow, we can find the molar mass of NaCl by adding the molar masses of Na and Cl:\nMolar mass of NaCl = Molar mass of Na + Molar mass of Cl\nMolar mass of NaCl = 22.99 g/mol + 35.45 g/mol\nMolar mass of NaCl = 58.44 g/mol\n\nNext, we will find the percent composition of each element in NaCl:\nPercent composition of Na = (Molar mass of Na / Molar mass of NaCl) x 100\nPercent composition of Na = (22.99 g/mol / 58.44 g/mol) x 100\nPercent composition of Na ≈ 39.3%\n\nPercent composition of Cl = (Molar mass of Cl / Molar mass of NaCl) x 100\nPercent composition of Cl = (35.45 g/mol / 58.44 g/mol) x 100\nPercent composition of Cl ≈ 60.7%\n\nSo, the percent composition of sodium chloride (NaCl) is approximately 39.3% sodium (Na) and 60.7% chlorine (Cl)."
