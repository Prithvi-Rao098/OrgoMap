    "message_2": "To calculate the bond order of the carbon monoxide (CO) molecule using molecular orbital theory, we first need to determine the electronic configuration of the molecule.\n\nCarbon has 6 electrons and oxygen has 8 electrons, so CO has a total of 14 electrons. The molecular orbitals of CO are filled in the following order: σ(1s), σ*(1s), σ(2s), σ*(2s), σ(2pz), π(2px) = π(2py), π*(2px) = π*(2py).\n\nNow, let's fill the molecular orbitals with the 14 electrons:\n\n1. σ(1s) - 2 electrons\n2. σ*(1s) - 2 electrons\n3. σ(2s) - 2 electrons\n4. σ*(2s) - 2 electrons\n5. σ(2pz) - 2 electrons\n6. π(2px) = π(2py) - 4 electrons (2 in each orbital)\n7. π*(2px) = π*(2py) - 0 electrons (none left)\n\nNow we can calculate the bond order using the formula:\n\nBond order = (number of electrons in bonding orbitals - number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\n\nBond order = (10 - 4) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3\n\nThe bond order of the carbon monoxide molecule (CO) is 3.\n\nA higher bond order indicates a stronger and more stable bond. In the case of CO, the bond order of 3 suggests a strong triple bond between the carbon and oxygen atoms, making the molecule quite stable."
