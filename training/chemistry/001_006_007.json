    "message_2": "When 1-methylcyclohexene undergoes hydrogenation in the presence of a palladium catalyst, the major product formed is methylcyclohexane. This reaction involves the addition of hydrogen (H2) across the carbon-carbon double bond, converting the alkene (1-methylcyclohexene) into an alkane (methylcyclohexane)."
