    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction, we can use the formula:\n\nKc = [NH3]^2 / ([N2] * [H2]^3)\n\nGiven the concentrations of N2, H2, and NH3 are 0.25 M, 0.10 M, and 0.20 M, respectively, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nKc = (0.20)^2 / (0.25 * (0.10)^3)\n\nKc = (0.04) / (0.25 * 0.001)\n\nKc = 0.04 / 0.00025\n\nKc = 160\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction at this certain temperature is 160."
