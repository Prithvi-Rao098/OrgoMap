    "message_2": "To determine the age of the fossil, we can use the formula for radioactive decay:\n\nN(t) = N0 * (1/2)^(t / t_half)\n\nWhere:\n- N(t) is the amount of carbon-14 remaining at time t\n- N0 is the initial amount of carbon-14\n- t_half is the half-life of carbon-14 (5730 years)\n- t is the time elapsed (the age of the fossil)\n\nSince the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 is 1:4, this means that the fraction of carbon-14 remaining is 1 / (1+4) = 1/5.\n\nSo, N(t) / N0 = 1/5.\n\nNow, we can plug this into the radioactive decay formula:\n\n1/5 = (1/2)^(t / 5730)\n\nTo solve for t, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(1/5) = (t / 5730) * ln(1/2)\n\nNow, we can solve for t:\n\nt = 5730 * (ln(1/5) / ln(1/2))\nt â‰ˆ 11020.4 years\n\nThe age of the fossil is approximately 11,020 years."
