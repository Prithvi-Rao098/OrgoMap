    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first determine the limiting reactant, and then use stoichiometry to find the mass of lead(II) iodide that will precipitate.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nPb(NO3)2 (aq) + 2 KI (aq) → PbI2 (s) + 2 KNO3 (aq)\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of each reactant:\n\nMoles of Pb(NO3)2 = (0.2 mol/L) × (0.100 L) = 0.020 mol\nMoles of KI = (0.15 mol/L) × (0.150 L) = 0.0225 mol\n\nNow, we will determine the limiting reactant by comparing the mole ratio of the reactants:\n\nMole ratio of Pb(NO3)2 to KI = 1:2\nMoles of KI required for complete reaction with Pb(NO3)2 = 0.020 mol × 2 = 0.040 mol\n\nSince we have only 0.0225 mol of KI, KI is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow, we will use stoichiometry to find the moles of PbI2 that will precipitate:\n\nMole ratio of KI to PbI2 = 2:1\nMoles of PbI2 = 0.0225 mol KI × (1 mol PbI2 / 2 mol KI) = 0.01125 mol PbI2\n\nFinally, we will find the mass of PbI2:\n\nMolar mass of PbI2 = 207.2 g/mol (Pb) + 2 × 126.9 g/mol (I) = 460 g/mol\nMass of PbI2 = 0.01125 mol × 460 g/mol = 5.17 g\n\nTherefore, 5.17 g of lead(II) iodide will precipitate when 100 mL of 0.2 M lead(II) nitrate solution is mixed with 150 mL of 0.15 M potassium iodide solution."
