    "message_2": "The formation of the iron(III)-thiocyanate complex ion equilibrium is affected by changes in pH due to the involvement of ions in the reaction. The reaction can be represented as follows:\n\nFe³⁺(aq) + SCN⁻(aq) ⇌ FeSCN²⁺(aq)\n\nIn this reaction, iron(III) ions (Fe³⁺) react with thiocyanate ions (SCN⁻) to form the iron(III)-thiocyanate complex ion (FeSCN²⁺). The equilibrium constant for this reaction is given by:\n\nK = [FeSCN²⁺] / ([Fe³⁺][SCN⁻])\n\nNow, let's consider how changes in pH can affect this equilibrium:\n\n1. Increase in pH (more basic conditions): When the pH increases, the concentration of H⁺ ions in the solution decreases. Thiocyanate ions can react with H⁺ ions to form HSCN, which reduces the concentration of SCN⁻ ions available for the formation of the complex:\n\nH⁺(aq) + SCN⁻(aq) ⇌ HSCN(aq)\n\nUnder more basic conditions, this reaction shifts to the left, increasing the concentration of SCN⁻ ions. As a result, the formation of the iron(III)-thiocyanate complex ion is favored, and the equilibrium shifts to the right.\n\n2. Decrease in pH (more acidic conditions): When the pH decreases, the concentration of H⁺ ions in the solution increases. This leads to an increase in the formation of HSCN, which reduces the concentration of SCN⁻ ions available for the formation of the complex. Consequently, the equilibrium shifts to the left, disfavoring the formation of the iron(III)-thiocyanate complex ion.\n\nIn summary, an increase in pH (more basic conditions) favors the formation of the iron(III)-thiocyanate complex ion, while a decrease in pH (more acidic conditions) disfavors its formation."
