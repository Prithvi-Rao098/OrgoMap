    "message_2": "To determine the purity of the given sample of aspirin, we need to first find its melting point. The melting point of a substance is the temperature at which it changes from a solid to a liquid state. Pure aspirin has a melting point range of 138-140°C.\n\nTo find the melting point of the sample, follow these steps:\n\n1. Place a small amount of the aspirin sample in a capillary tube.\n2. Insert the capillary tube into a melting point apparatus.\n3. Slowly heat the sample and observe the temperature at which the sample starts to melt and the temperature at which it completely melts.\n\nOnce you have the melting point range of the sample, compare it to the expected melting point range of pure aspirin (138-140°C). If the sample's melting point range is within the expected range, it is likely that the sample is pure and meets the USP purity standard of at least 99%.\n\nHowever, if the sample's melting point range is lower than the expected range, it may indicate the presence of impurities. In this case, further tests, such as a purity analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), may be necessary to determine the exact purity of the sample."
