    "message_2": "The hydrolysis of tert-butyl chloride (t-BuCl) in the presence of water is an example of a nucleophilic substitution reaction. Specifically, it follows the SN1 (Substitution Nucleophilic Unimolecular) mechanism. In this mechanism, the reaction proceeds through two steps:\n\n1. Formation of a carbocation intermediate: The t-BuCl undergoes heterolytic bond cleavage, where the chlorine atom leaves as a chloride ion (Cl-) and the tert-butyl carbocation (t-Bu+) is formed. This step is the rate-determining step, as it involves the breaking of the carbon-chlorine bond.\n\nt-BuCl → t-Bu+ + Cl-\n\n2. Nucleophilic attack by water: The water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbocation, forming a bond with the positively charged carbon atom. This step is relatively fast compared to the first step.\n\nt-Bu+ + H2O → t-BuOH + H+\n\nTo calculate the rate constant (k) of the reaction at 25°C, we need experimental data or the activation energy (Ea) and the pre-exponential factor (A) from the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk = Ae^(-Ea/RT)\n\nwhere R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K) and T is the temperature in Kelvin (25°C = 298K).\n\nWithout the experimental data or the values of Ea and A, we cannot calculate the rate constant for this reaction. However, if you have access to these values, you can plug them into the Arrhenius equation to determine the rate constant at 25°C."
