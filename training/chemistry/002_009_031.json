After combustion, the sample produced 9.375 grams of carbon dioxide and 3.125 grams of water. What is the empirical and molecular formula of the inorganic compound?",
    "message_2": "To determine the empirical and molecular formulas of the unknown inorganic compound, we first need to find the moles of each element present in the compound.\n\n1. Calculate the moles of carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) from the products of combustion:\n\nFrom the given data, we have 9.375 grams of carbon dioxide (CO₂) and 3.125 grams of water (H₂O).\n\nMoles of C in CO₂:\nMolar mass of CO₂ = 12.01 g/mol (C) + 2 * 16.00 g/mol (O) = 44.01 g/mol\nMoles of C = (9.375 g CO₂) / (44.01 g/mol) = 0.213 mol C\n\nMoles of H in H₂O:\nMolar mass of H₂O = 2 * 1.01 g/mol (H) + 16.00 g/mol (O) = 18.02 g/mol\nMoles of H = (3.125 g H₂O) / (18.02 g/mol) = 0.173 mol H\n\n2. Determine the moles of oxygen (O) in the unknown compound:\n\nSince the compound is inorganic, we can assume that the remaining mass is due to oxygen.\n\nMass of O = Mass of the compound - Mass of C - Mass of H\nMass of C = 0.213 mol C * 12.01 g/mol = 2.56 g\nMass of H = 0.173 mol H * 1.01 g/mol = 0.175 g\n\nMass of O = 6.25 g (compound) - 2.56 g (C) - 0.175 g (H) = 3.515 g\n\nMoles of O = (3.515 g O) / (16.00 g/mol) = 0.220 mol O\n\n3. Determine the empirical formula:\n\nDivide the moles of each element by the smallest number of moles to get the mole ratio:\n\nMole ratio of C:H:O = 0.213:0.173:0.220 / 0.173 = 1.23:1:1.27\n\nSince these ratios are close to whole numbers, we can round them to get the empirical formula:\n\nEmpirical formula = C₁H₁O₁ = CHO\n\n4. Determine the molecular formula:\n\nTo find the molecular formula, we need the molar mass of the unknown compound. Unfortunately, the problem does not provide this information. Therefore, we cannot determine the molecular formula without additional information.\n\nIn conclusion, the empirical formula of the unknown inorganic compound is CHO. The molecular formula cannot be determined without more information."
