    "message_2": "The balanced chemical equation for the preparation of phenylalanine from benzyl chloride and ammonia is:\n\nC6H5CH2Cl + 2 NH3 â†’ C6H5CH2NH2 + NH4Cl\n\nTo calculate the theoretical yield of phenylalanine, we first need to determine the moles of benzyl chloride:\n\nMoles of benzyl chloride = mass (g) / molar mass (g/mol)\nMolar mass of benzyl chloride = 12.01 (C) * 7 + 1.01 (H) * 5 + 35.45 (Cl) = 126.58 g/mol\n\nMoles of benzyl chloride = 50 g / 126.58 g/mol = 0.395 moles\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, the moles of phenylalanine produced will be equal to the moles of benzyl chloride:\n\nMoles of phenylalanine = 0.395 moles\n\nNow, we can calculate the mass of phenylalanine produced:\n\nMass of phenylalanine = moles * molar mass\nMolar mass of phenylalanine = 12.01 (C) * 9 + 1.01 (H) * 11 + 14.01 (N) * 1 + 16.00 (O) * 1 = 165.19 g/mol\n\nMass of phenylalanine = 0.395 moles * 165.19 g/mol = 65.20 g\n\nThe theoretical yield of phenylalanine that can be obtained from 50 g of benzyl chloride and an excess of ammonia is 65.20 g."
