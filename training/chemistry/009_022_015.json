    "message_2": "The maximum dose of radiation a patient can receive during radiation therapy varies depending on several factors, including the type of cancer, the location of the tumor, the patient's overall health, and the specific treatment plan. Generally, radiation doses are measured in units called Gray (Gy), and the total dose is divided into smaller doses called fractions, which are administered over several weeks.\n\nThe maximum dose is determined by considering the tolerance of healthy tissues surrounding the tumor, as well as the desired level of tumor control. Oncologists and radiation therapists work together to develop a treatment plan that delivers the most effective dose while minimizing damage to healthy tissues.\n\nThe type of cancer being treated can significantly affect the dose and duration of radiation therapy. Some cancers are more sensitive to radiation, requiring lower doses, while others may require higher doses to achieve the desired level of tumor control. Additionally, the location of the tumor can influence the dose, as some areas of the body are more sensitive to radiation than others.\n\nFor example, lung cancer may require a total dose of 60-70 Gy, divided into daily fractions of 1.8-2 Gy over six to seven weeks. On the other hand, breast cancer may require a total dose of 45-50 Gy, divided into daily fractions of 1.8-2 Gy over five to six weeks.\n\nIn summary, the maximum dose of radiation a patient can receive during radiation therapy depends on various factors, including the type of cancer and the patient's overall health. Oncologists and radiation therapists work together to develop a treatment plan that delivers the most effective dose while minimizing damage to healthy tissues. The type of cancer being treated can significantly affect the dose and duration of radiation therapy."
