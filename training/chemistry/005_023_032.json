    "message_2": "Acyl-CoA synthetase, also known as long-chain fatty acid-CoA ligase, plays a crucial role in the metabolism of long-chain fatty acids. This enzyme catalyzes the activation of long-chain fatty acids by converting them into their corresponding fatty acyl-CoA esters. This activation is essential for the subsequent metabolism of these fatty acids through processes such as Î²-oxidation, synthesis of phospholipids, and synthesis of triacylglycerols.\n\nThe reaction catalyzed by acyl-CoA synthetase involves three steps:\n\n1. The formation of a fatty acyl-adenylate intermediate by reacting with ATP, resulting in the release of pyrophosphate (PPi).\n2. The binding of the fatty acyl-adenylate intermediate to the enzyme, which facilitates the transfer of the fatty acyl group to Coenzyme A (CoA).\n3. The release of the fatty acyl-CoA ester and AMP from the enzyme.\n\nIn contrast, short-chain fatty acids are metabolized by a different enzyme called short-chain fatty acid-CoA ligase (or short-chain acyl-CoA synthetase). This enzyme also catalyzes the activation of short-chain fatty acids into their corresponding acyl-CoA esters. However, the primary difference between these two enzymes lies in their substrate specificity. While acyl-CoA synthetase is specific for long-chain fatty acids (typically those with carbon chain lengths of 12 or more), short-chain fatty acid-CoA ligase is specific for short-chain fatty acids (typically those with carbon chain lengths of fewer than 12).\n\nBoth enzymes are essential for the proper metabolism of fatty acids, as they enable the fatty acids to enter various metabolic pathways depending on their chain length. The specificity of these enzymes ensures that fatty acids of different chain lengths are processed efficiently and accurately within the cell."
