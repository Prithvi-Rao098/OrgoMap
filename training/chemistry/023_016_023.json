    "message_1": "What is the balanced chemical equation for the reaction of aniline and chlorine gas to prepare 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline, and what is the percent yield of the reaction if 10 grams of aniline is used and 7 grams of the product is obtained?",
    "message_2": "The reaction of aniline with chlorine gas to prepare 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline involves two steps. First, aniline reacts with a nitrating agent, such as a mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4), to form 4-nitroaniline. Then, 4-nitroaniline reacts with chlorine gas to form 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline.\n\nStep 1: Nitration of aniline\nC6H7N + HNO3 → C6H6N2O2 + H2O\n\nStep 2: Chlorination of 4-nitroaniline\nC6H6N2O2 + Cl2 → C6H5ClN2O2 + HCl\n\nOverall reaction:\nC6H7N + HNO3 + Cl2 → C6H5ClN2O2 + H2O + HCl\n\nNow, let's calculate the percent yield:\n\n1. Calculate the theoretical yield:\nMolar mass of aniline (C6H7N) = 93.13 g/mol\nMolar mass of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline (C6H5ClN2O2) = 172.57 g/mol\n\n10 g of aniline * (1 mol aniline / 93.13 g) * (1 mol 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline / 1 mol aniline) * (172.57 g / 1 mol 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline) = 18.53 g (theoretical yield)\n\n2. Calculate the percent yield:\nPercent yield = (actual yield / theoretical yield) * 100\nPercent yield = (7 g / 18.53 g) * 100 = 37.78%\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\nC6H7N + HNO3 + Cl2 → C6H5ClN2O2 + H2O + HCl\n\nThe percent yield of the reaction is 37.78%."
