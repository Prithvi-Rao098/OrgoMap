    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (K) for the reaction between nitrous acid (HNO2) and iodide ions (I-) to form nitric oxide (NO) and iodine (I2), we can use the Nernst equation and the relationship between the standard cell potential (E°) and the equilibrium constant.\n\nFirst, we need to write the half-reactions for the reduction and oxidation processes:\n\nReduction half-reaction (NO formation):\n2HNO2 + 2e- → NO + H2O + 2NO2-\n\nOxidation half-reaction (I2 formation):\n2I- → I2 + 2e-\n\nNow, we can combine these half-reactions to form the overall balanced redox reaction:\n\n2HNO2 + 2I- → NO + H2O + 2NO2- + I2\n\nNext, we need to find the standard cell potential (E°) for the overall reaction. Since we are given the reduction potential of NO (E°(NO)) and the oxidation potential of I2 (E°(I2)), we can calculate the standard cell potential as follows:\n\nE°(cell) = E°(NO) - E°(I2)\nE°(cell) = (+0.82 V) - (+0.54 V)\nE°(cell) = +0.28 V\n\nNow, we can use the Nernst equation to find the equilibrium constant (K) for the reaction:\n\nE°(cell) = (RT/nF) * ln(K)\n\nWhere:\n- R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\n- T is the temperature in Kelvin (25°C = 298.15 K)\n- n is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the reaction (2 moles in this case)\n- F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol)\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for K:\n\nK = exp(nFE°(cell) / RT)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nK = exp(2 * 96485 * 0.28 / (8.314 * 298.15))\nK ≈ 3.3 × 10^4\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium constant (K) for the reaction between nitrous acid and iodide ions to form nitric oxide and iodine under standard conditions at 25°C is approximately 3.3 × 10^4."
