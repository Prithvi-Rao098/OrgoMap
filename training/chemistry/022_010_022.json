    "message_2": "The balanced equation for the precipitation reaction between silver nitrate (AgNO3) and sodium chloride (NaCl) is:\n\nAgNO3(aq) + NaCl(aq) → AgCl(s) + NaNO3(aq)\n\nTo find the mass of silver chloride (AgCl) precipitate formed, we first need to determine the moles of the reactants.\n\nMoles of AgNO3 = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 M × 0.050 L = 0.005 moles\nMoles of NaCl = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 M × 0.050 L = 0.005 moles\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, both reactants will be completely consumed, and 0.005 moles of AgCl will be formed.\n\nNext, we need to find the mass of AgCl formed. To do this, we will use the molar mass of AgCl (107.87 g/mol for Ag + 35.45 g/mol for Cl = 143.32 g/mol).\n\nMass of AgCl = Moles × Molar mass = 0.005 moles × 143.32 g/mol = 0.7166 g\n\nSo, the mass of silver chloride precipitate formed when 50 mL of a 0.1 M silver nitrate solution is mixed with 50 mL of a 0.1 M sodium chloride solution is approximately 0.7166 grams."
