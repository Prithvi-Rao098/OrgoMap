For the reactants, we have 1 mole of Fe2O3(s) and 3 moles of H2(g). The ΔH°f for H2(g) is 0 kJ/mol since it is in its standard state.\n\nΔH°rxn = [(2 mol Fe × ΔH°f(Fe)) + (3 mol H2O × ΔH°f(H2O))] - [(1 mol Fe2O3 × ΔH°f(Fe2O3)) + (3 mol H2 × ΔH°f(H2))]\n\nΔH°rxn = [(2 mol × 0 kJ/mol) + (3 mol × -241.8 kJ/mol)] - [(1 mol × -824.2 kJ/mol) + (3 mol × 0 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH°rxn = [0 kJ + (-725.4 kJ)] - [-824.2 kJ]\n\nΔH°rxn = -725.4 kJ + 824.2 kJ\n\nΔH°rxn = 98.8 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy of reduction for the given reaction is 98.8 kJ/mol."
