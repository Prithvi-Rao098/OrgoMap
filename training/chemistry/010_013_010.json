    "message_2": "First, we need to find the total charge transferred during the 15 minutes. We can do this using the formula:\n\nCharge (Q) = Current (I) × Time (t)\n\nGiven that the current (I) is 2.0 A and the time (t) is 15 minutes, we need to convert the time to seconds:\n\n15 minutes × 60 seconds/minute = 900 seconds\n\nNow we can calculate the charge:\n\nQ = 2.0 A × 900 s = 1800 C\n\nNext, we need to find the number of moles of electrons transferred. We can do this using the Faraday constant (F), which is 96,485 C/mol:\n\nMoles of electrons (n) = Charge (Q) / Faraday constant (F)\n\nn = 1800 C / 96,485 C/mol ≈ 0.01865 mol\n\nNow, we know that in the redox reaction of CuSO4, copper (Cu) is reduced from Cu²⁺ to Cu, which means that each Cu²⁺ ion gains 2 electrons. Therefore, we need to find the number of moles of Cu²⁺ ions reduced:\n\nMoles of Cu²⁺ ions = Moles of electrons / 2\n\nMoles of Cu²⁺ ions ≈ 0.01865 mol / 2 ≈ 0.009325 mol\n\nFinally, we can find the total number of electrons transferred by multiplying the moles of electrons by Avogadro's number (6.022 × 10²³ particles/mol):\n\nTotal number of electrons ≈ 0.01865 mol × 6.022 × 10²³ electrons/mol ≈ 1.12 × 10²³ electrons\n\nSo, the total number of electrons transferred when a current of 2.0 A flows through a solution of CuSO4 for 15 minutes is approximately 1.12 × 10²³ electrons."
