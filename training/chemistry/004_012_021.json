    "message_1": "A chemistry student needs to determine the percent composition of nitrogen (N) in a sample of an unknown organic compound. Using elemental analysis, the student determines the mass of the sample to be 0.254 g and the mass of the products after combustion to be 0.727 g of CO2 and 0.298 g of H2O. What is the percent composition of nitrogen in the sample?",
    "message_2": "To determine the percent composition of nitrogen in the sample, we first need to find the mass of carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) in the sample. We can do this by using the masses of CO2 and H2O produced after combustion.\n\n1. Find the mass of carbon in the sample:\nThe molecular weight of CO2 is 12.01 g/mol (C) + 2 * 16.00 g/mol (O) = 44.01 g/mol.\nThe mass of carbon in the CO2 produced is (0.727 g CO2) * (12.01 g C / 44.01 g CO2) = 0.198 g C.\n\n2. Find the mass of hydrogen in the sample:\nThe molecular weight of H2O is 2 * 1.01 g/mol (H) + 16.00 g/mol (O) = 18.02 g/mol.\nThe mass of hydrogen in the H2O produced is (0.298 g H2O) * (2.02 g H / 18.02 g H2O) = 0.033 g H.\n\n3. Find the mass of nitrogen in the sample:\nThe mass of the sample is the sum of the masses of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen.\nMass of nitrogen = Mass of sample - Mass of carbon - Mass of hydrogen\nMass of nitrogen = 0.254 g - 0.198 g - 0.033 g = 0.023 g N.\n\n4. Calculate the percent composition of nitrogen in the sample:\nPercent composition of nitrogen = (Mass of nitrogen / Mass of sample) * 100%\nPercent composition of nitrogen = (0.023 g N / 0.254 g sample) * 100% = 9.06%\n\nThe percent composition of nitrogen in the sample is 9.06%."
