    "message_2": "To determine the mass of silver deposited on the cathode, we can use Faraday's laws of electrolysis. First, we need to find the charge (Q) passed through the solution:\n\nQ = current (I) × time (t)\nwhere I = 2.5 A and t = 45 minutes = 2700 seconds\n\nQ = 2.5 A × 2700 s = 6750 C (coulombs)\n\nNext, we need to find the number of moles of electrons (n) transferred:\n\nn = Q / (F × z)\nwhere F = Faraday's constant (96485 C/mol) and z = number of electrons transferred per mole of silver (1 for Ag+)\n\nn = 6750 C / (96485 C/mol × 1) = 0.0699 mol\n\nNow, we can find the mass of silver deposited:\n\nmass = n × molar mass of silver (Ag)\nwhere molar mass of Ag = 107.87 g/mol\n\nmass = 0.0699 mol × 107.87 g/mol = 7.54 g\n\nSo, 7.54 grams of silver will be deposited on the cathode during the electrolysis of AgNO3 solution with a current of 2.5 A flowing for 45 minutes, assuming 100% current efficiency."
