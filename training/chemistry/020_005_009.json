    "message_1": "What will happen to the concentration of NOCl in a 1 L reaction vessel at equilibrium when 0.1 mol of Cl2 is added to the system initially containing 0.2 mol of NO and 0.1 mol of Cl2? The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n2NO(g) + Cl2(g) â‡Œ 2NOCl(g)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table method. First, let's find the initial concentrations of each species:\n\nInitial concentrations:\n[NO] = 0.2 mol / 1 L = 0.2 M\n[Cl2] = (0.1 mol + 0.1 mol) / 1 L = 0.2 M\n[NOCl] = 0 (since it is not mentioned)\n\nNow, let's set up the ICE table:\n\n          | 2NO   | Cl2   | 2NOCl\nInitial   | 0.2   | 0.2   | 0\nChange    | -2x   | -x    | +2x\nEquilibrium| 0.2-2x| 0.2-x | 2x\n\nAt equilibrium, the reaction quotient (Q) will be equal to the equilibrium constant (K). We can write the expression for Q as:\n\nQ = [NOCl]^2 / ([NO]^2 * [Cl2])\n\nSince we don't have the value of K, we cannot find the exact concentrations of the species at equilibrium. However, we can analyze the effect of adding Cl2 on the system using Le Chatelier's principle.\n\nAccording to Le Chatelier's principle, when a change is applied to a system at equilibrium, the system will shift in the direction that counteracts the change. In this case, we have increased the concentration of Cl2. As a result, the system will shift to the right (toward the formation of NOCl) to counteract the increase in Cl2 concentration.\n\nThis means that the concentration of NOCl will increase, while the concentrations of NO and Cl2 will decrease. However, without the value of K, we cannot determine the exact concentrations at equilibrium."
