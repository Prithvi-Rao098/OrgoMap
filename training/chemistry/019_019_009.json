    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the formula:\n\nΔH° = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH° is the standard enthalpy change, and ΔHf° is the standard enthalpy of formation.\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\n2H2(g) + O2(g) ⟶ 2H2O(g)\n\nΔH° = [2 × ΔHf°(H2O(g))] - [2 × ΔHf°(H2(g)) + ΔHf°(O2(g))]\n\nSince the standard enthalpies of formation of H2(g) and O2(g) are 0 kJ/mol:\n\nΔH° = [2 × (-242 kJ/mol)] - [2 × 0 kJ/mol + 0 kJ/mol]\n\nΔH° = -484 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the reaction is -484 kJ/mol."
