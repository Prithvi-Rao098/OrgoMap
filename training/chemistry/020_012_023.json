    "message_2": "When 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH) is mixed with 0.1 M sodium acetate (CH3COONa), a buffer solution is formed. The buffer solution can resist changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. In this case, 0.05 M hydrochloric acid (HCl) is added to the system.\n\nFirst, let's find the initial pH of the buffer solution using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log ([A-]/[HA])\n\nwhere pH is the solution's pH, pKa is the acid dissociation constant, [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate ion, CH3COO-), and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid (acetic acid, CH3COOH).\n\npH = 4.76 + log (0.1/0.1)\npH = 4.76\n\nNow, let's consider the reaction between the added HCl and the acetate ions in the buffer solution:\n\nHCl + CH3COO- → CH3COOH + Cl-\n\nSince the volume of the solution remains constant at 1 L, we can calculate the moles of each species:\n\nmoles HCl = 0.05 mol\nmoles CH3COO- = 0.1 mol\nmoles CH3COOH = 0.1 mol\n\nAfter the reaction, the moles of each species will be:\n\nmoles HCl = 0 mol (completely reacted)\nmoles CH3COO- = 0.1 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol\nmoles CH3COOH = 0.1 + 0.05 = 0.15 mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the new pH of the solution using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation again:\n\npH = 4.76 + log ([A-]/[HA])\npH = 4.76 + log (0.05/0.15)\npH = 4.76 - 0.48\npH ≈ 4.28\n\nSo, the new pH of the solution is approximately 4.28. The equilibrium shifts to the left (toward the formation of acetic acid) due to the addition of HCl."
