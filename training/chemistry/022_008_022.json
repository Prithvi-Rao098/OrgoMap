    "message_2": "When a copper wire is placed into a silver nitrate solution, a single replacement reaction occurs. Copper is more reactive than silver, so it displaces silver from the silver nitrate solution, forming copper nitrate and solid silver. The copper wire will gradually become coated with silver, while the solution turns blue due to the formation of copper nitrate.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nCu(s) + 2AgNO₃(aq) → Cu(NO₃)₂(aq) + 2Ag(s)\n\nThis is a single replacement reaction (also known as a single displacement reaction) because one element (copper) replaces another element (silver) in a compound (silver nitrate)."
