    "message_1": "Sure, here's a possible question for the student to solve:\n\nA student wants to synthesize polyethylene using the polymerization of ethylene. The monomer has a molar mass of 28.05 g/mol and the polymerization reaction is exothermic, with a ΔH°rxn of -40 kJ/mol. If the student wants to obtain 100 g of polyethylene, how much heat (in kJ) will be released in the process? Assume 100% yield and no heat loss to the surroundings.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of moles of ethylene monomer required to produce 100 g of polyethylene and then calculate the heat released during the polymerization process.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the number of moles of ethylene monomer required to produce 100 g of polyethylene.\n\nSince the molar mass of ethylene is 28.05 g/mol, we can use the following equation to determine the number of moles:\n\nmoles = mass / molar mass\n\nmoles of ethylene = 100 g / 28.05 g/mol = 3.567 moles\n\nStep 2: Calculate the heat released during the polymerization process.\n\nWe are given that the ΔH°rxn for the polymerization of ethylene is -40 kJ/mol. Since the reaction is exothermic, the heat released will be negative. We can use the following equation to calculate the heat released:\n\nheat released = moles × ΔH°rxn\n\nheat released = 3.567 moles × (-40 kJ/mol) = -142.68 kJ\n\nTherefore, the heat released during the synthesis of 100 g of polyethylene is approximately -142.68 kJ."
