    "message_2": "To determine the boiling point of a solution containing a nonvolatile solute, we can use the boiling point elevation formula:\n\nΔTb = Kb * molality * i\n\nwhere ΔTb is the boiling point elevation, Kb is the boiling point elevation constant for the solvent (water in this case), molality is the molality of the solution, and i is the van't Hoff factor (which represents the number of particles the solute dissociates into in the solution). For a nonvolatile solute like sucrose, the van't Hoff factor (i) is 1.\n\nFirst, let's find the molality of the solution:\n\nMolality = moles of solute / kg of solvent\n\nThe molar mass of sucrose (C12H22O11) is approximately 342.3 g/mol. So, we can find the moles of sucrose:\n\nmoles of sucrose = 50 g / 342.3 g/mol ≈ 0.146 mol\n\nNow, we can find the molality:\n\nMolality = 0.146 mol / 0.2 kg ≈ 0.73 mol/kg\n\nThe boiling point elevation constant (Kb) for water is 0.512 °C/mol/kg. Now, we can use the boiling point elevation formula:\n\nΔTb = Kb * molality * i\nΔTb = 0.512 °C/mol/kg * 0.73 mol/kg * 1 ≈ 0.373 °C\n\nThe normal boiling point of water is 100 °C. So, the boiling point of the solution is:\n\nBoiling point of solution = 100 °C + 0.373 °C ≈ 100.373 °C\n\nTherefore, the boiling point of the solution containing 50 grams of sucrose dissolved in 200 grams of water is approximately 100.373 °C at 1 atm pressure."
