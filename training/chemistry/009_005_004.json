    "message_1": "What is the nuclear binding energy of a Helium-4 nucleus (2 protons and 2 neutrons) in MeV? Given that the mass of 2 protons and 2 neutrons is 4.0336 atomic mass units (amu), and the mass of a Helium-4 nucleus is 4.0026 amu. Use the equation E = Δmc², where Δm is the difference in masses of the individual particles and c is the speed of light (3 × 10^8 m/s) to calculate the nuclear binding energy.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the mass difference (Δm) between the individual particles and the Helium-4 nucleus:\n\nΔm = (mass of 2 protons and 2 neutrons) - (mass of Helium-4 nucleus)\nΔm = 4.0336 amu - 4.0026 amu\nΔm = 0.0310 amu\n\nNow, we need to convert the mass difference from atomic mass units (amu) to kilograms (kg). 1 amu is equal to 1.66054 × 10^-27 kg:\n\nΔm = 0.0310 amu × (1.66054 × 10^-27 kg/amu)\nΔm = 5.14767 × 10^-29 kg\n\nNow, we can use the equation E = Δmc² to calculate the nuclear binding energy:\n\nE = (5.14767 × 10^-29 kg) × (3 × 10^8 m/s)²\nE = 5.14767 × 10^-29 kg × 9 × 10^16 m²/s²\nE = 4.6329 × 10^-12 Joules\n\nFinally, we need to convert the energy from Joules to MeV (Mega-electron volts). 1 Joule is equal to 6.242 × 10^12 MeV:\n\nE = 4.6329 × 10^-12 Joules × (6.242 × 10^12 MeV/Joule)\nE = 28.92 MeV\n\nSo, the nuclear binding energy of a Helium-4 nucleus is approximately 28.92 MeV."
