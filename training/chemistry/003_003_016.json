    "message_2": "The rate law expression for the reaction A + 2B → C, given that it is second order with respect to A and first order with respect to B, can be written as:\n\nRate = k[A]^2[B]^1\n\nwhere Rate is the reaction rate, k is the rate constant, [A] is the concentration of A, and [B] is the concentration of B.\n\nThe overall order of the reaction is the sum of the individual orders with respect to each reactant. In this case, it is:\n\nOverall order = 2 (order with respect to A) + 1 (order with respect to B) = 3"
