    "message_2": "When copper is placed in a solution of silver nitrate, a single displacement reaction occurs. Copper replaces silver in the silver nitrate solution, forming copper nitrate and solid silver. The chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nCu(s) + 2AgNO3(aq) â†’ Cu(NO3)2(aq) + 2Ag(s)\n\nIn this reaction, silver (Ag) is being replaced by copper (Cu)."
