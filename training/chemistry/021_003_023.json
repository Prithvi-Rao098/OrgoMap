    "message_2": "The predicted bond angle in a water molecule (H2O) based on its molecular geometry is approximately 104.5 degrees. This is due to the bent shape of the molecule, which results from the presence of two lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen atom in addition to the two O-H bonds. The molecular geometry of water is described as bent or V-shaped, and it is based on the tetrahedral electron-pair geometry."
