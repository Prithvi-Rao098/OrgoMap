    "message_1": "What is the effect of increasing the pressure on the equilibrium position of a reaction where the number of moles of gaseous products is greater than the number of moles of gaseous reactants?",
    "message_2": "When the pressure is increased on a reaction where the number of moles of gaseous products is greater than the number of moles of gaseous reactants, the equilibrium position will shift towards the side with fewer moles of gas. This is because the system will try to counteract the increase in pressure by reducing the total number of gaseous particles, thus decreasing the pressure. In this case, the equilibrium will shift towards the reactants side, favoring the reverse reaction. This observation can be explained by Le Chatelier's principle, which states that a system at equilibrium will adjust to minimize the effect of any change in conditions."
