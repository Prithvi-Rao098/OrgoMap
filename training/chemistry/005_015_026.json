    "message_2": "The complete oxidation of one molecule of glucose involves three main stages: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle), and oxidative phosphorylation (which includes the electron transport chain and chemiosmosis). Here is the breakdown of ATP production in each stage:\n\n1. Glycolysis:\n- 2 ATP molecules are used in the initial steps of glycolysis.\n- 4 ATP molecules are produced in the later steps of glycolysis.\n- Net production in glycolysis: 4 - 2 = 2 ATP\n\n2. Citric Acid Cycle:\n- Since glycolysis produces 2 molecules of pyruvate from 1 molecule of glucose, each pyruvate molecule enters the citric acid cycle. Thus, the cycle occurs twice for each glucose molecule.\n- In each turn of the citric acid cycle, 1 ATP (or GTP, which can be converted to ATP) is produced.\n- Net production in the citric acid cycle: 2 x 1 = 2 ATP\n\n3. Oxidative Phosphorylation:\n- During glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, NADH and FADH2 molecules are produced. These molecules carry high-energy electrons, which are used in the electron transport chain to generate ATP through oxidative phosphorylation.\n- For each glucose molecule, 2 NADH are produced in glycolysis, 2 NADH are produced during the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, 6 NADH are produced in the citric acid cycle, and 4 FADH2 are produced in the citric acid cycle.\n- In the electron transport chain, each NADH molecule generates approximately 2.5 ATP, and each FADH2 molecule generates approximately 1.5 ATP.\n- Net production in oxidative phosphorylation: (2 + 2 + 6) x 2.5 + 4 x 1.5 = 10 + 6 = 26 ATP\n\nTotal net ATP production from the complete oxidation of one molecule of glucose in the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation: 2 (glycolysis) + 2 (citric acid cycle) + 26 (oxidative phosphorylation) = 30 ATP\n\nNote: The actual ATP yield may vary slightly depending on the efficiency of the electron transport chain and the specific cell type. Some sources may report a total net ATP production of 32 or 36 ATP, but 30 ATP is a commonly accepted value."
