    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the vaporization of 25.0 g of water, we first need to determine the number of moles of water present. We can do this using the molar mass of water:\n\nmoles of water = (mass of water) / (molar mass of water)\nmoles of water = (25.0 g) / (18.015 g/mol)\nmoles of water ≈ 1.387 moles\n\nNow that we have the number of moles of water, we can use the molar enthalpy of vaporization to calculate the standard enthalpy change:\n\nΔH = (moles of water) × (molar enthalpy of vaporization)\nΔH = (1.387 moles) × (40.7 kJ/mol)\nΔH ≈ 56.4 kJ\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the vaporization of 25.0 g of water at 100°C is approximately 56.4 kJ."
