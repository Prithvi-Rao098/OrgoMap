    "message_2": "Ibuprofen has the molecular formula C13H18O2 and is a widely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). A viable multi-step synthesis of ibuprofen from commercially available starting materials can be achieved through the following retrosynthetic analysis:\n\n1. Starting material: Iso-butylbenzene (commercially available)\n2. First step: Friedel-Crafts acylation\n   Reagents: Acetyl chloride (CH3COCl) and aluminum chloride (AlCl3)\n   Conditions: Anhydrous conditions, room temperature\n   Product: 4'-isobutylacetophenone\n\n3. Second step: Reduction of the carbonyl group\n   Reagents: Sodium borohydride (NaBH4)\n   Conditions: Methanol (MeOH) as solvent, 0°C to room temperature\n   Product: 4'-isobutyl-1-phenylethanol\n\n4. Third step: Conversion to the corresponding carboxylic acid\n   Reagents: Potassium permanganate (KMnO4)\n   Conditions: Aqueous solution, reflux\n   Product: 4'-isobutyl-α-methylbenzylcarboxylic acid\n\n5. Fourth step: Conversion to the corresponding acid chloride\n   Reagents: Thionyl chloride (SOCl2)\n   Conditions: Anhydrous conditions, reflux\n   Product: 4'-isobutyl-α-methylbenzylcarbonyl chloride\n\n6. Fifth step: Formation of the final product (ibuprofen)\n   Reagents: Sodium salt of 2-methylpropionic acid (prepared by treating 2-methylpropionic acid with sodium hydroxide)\n   Conditions: Anhydrous conditions, room temperature\n   Product: Ibuprofen\n\nThis synthesis route involves five steps, starting from commercially available iso-butylbenzene and using well-established reactions and reagents. The overall yield can be optimized by carefully controlling reaction conditions and purifying intermediates as needed."
