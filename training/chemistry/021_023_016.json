    "message_2": "To determine if two molecules with the same molecular formula are isomers or not, you need to analyze their structural arrangement and connectivity of atoms. Isomers are molecules with the same molecular formula but different structures or spatial arrangements of atoms. There are two main types of isomerism: structural (constitutional) isomerism and stereoisomerism.\n\n1. Structural (constitutional) isomerism: In this type of isomerism, the molecules have the same molecular formula but different connectivity of atoms. To identify structural isomers, compare the arrangement of atoms and functional groups in the molecules. There are several subtypes of structural isomerism, including chain isomerism, positional isomerism, and functional group isomerism.\n\n- Chain isomerism: Isomers have different arrangements of the carbon skeleton (e.g., straight-chain vs. branched-chain isomers).\n- Positional isomerism: Isomers have the same carbon skeleton but differ in the position of a functional group or substituent.\n- Functional group isomerism: Isomers have the same molecular formula but different functional groups (e.g., alcohol vs. ether).\n\n2. Stereoisomerism: In this type of isomerism, the molecules have the same connectivity of atoms but different spatial arrangements. Stereoisomers can be further divided into two subtypes: enantiomers and diastereomers.\n\n- Enantiomers: These are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They have the same connectivity of atoms but differ in the arrangement of atoms in space, specifically at chiral centers (carbon atoms with four different substituents). To identify enantiomers, look for chiral centers and compare the spatial arrangement of substituents around them.\n- Diastereomers: These are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They can arise from multiple chiral centers or from restricted rotation around a bond (e.g., cis-trans isomerism in alkenes or geometric isomerism in cyclic compounds). To identify diastereomers, compare the spatial arrangement of atoms or groups in the molecules and look for differences that do not involve a mirror image relationship.\n\nIn summary, to determine if two molecules with the same molecular formula are isomers, analyze their structural arrangement and connectivity of atoms. If they exhibit different structures or spatial arrangements, they are isomers. Further classification into structural isomers or stereoisomers and their subtypes depends on the specific differences in their atomic connectivity and spatial arrangements."
