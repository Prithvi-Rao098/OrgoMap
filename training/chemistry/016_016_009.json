    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change of reduction for the given reaction, we can use the following formula:\n\nΔH_reaction = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH_f is the standard enthalpy of formation.\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\nΔH_reaction = [2ΔH_f(Fe) + 3ΔH_f(CO2)] - [ΔH_f(Fe2O3) + 3ΔH_f(CO)]\n\nSince the standard enthalpy of formation for elements in their standard state (such as Fe) is zero, we can simplify the equation:\n\nΔH_reaction = [3ΔH_f(CO2)] - [ΔH_f(Fe2O3) + 3ΔH_f(CO)]\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nΔH_reaction = [3(-393.5 kJ/mol)] - [(-824 kJ/mol) + 3(-110.5 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH_reaction = [-1180.5 kJ/mol] - [-1155.5 kJ/mol]\n\nΔH_reaction = -25 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the enthalpy change of reduction for the given reaction at 298 K is -25 kJ/mol."
