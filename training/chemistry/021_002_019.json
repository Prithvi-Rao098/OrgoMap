    "message_2": "In a methane molecule (CH4), there is one carbon atom bonded to four hydrogen atoms in a tetrahedral arrangement. The bond length between two carbon atoms in a methane molecule is not directly given, as there is only one carbon atom in the molecule. However, we can find the bond length between the carbon and hydrogen atoms (C-H bond length).\n\nThe distance between any two hydrogen atoms bonded to adjacent carbon atoms is given as 0.1095 nm. In a tetrahedral arrangement, the angle between any two hydrogen atoms (H-C-H) is 109.5°. We can use the law of cosines to find the C-H bond length.\n\nLet the C-H bond length be x. Then, using the law of cosines:\n\n0.1095^2 = x^2 + x^2 - 2x^2 * cos(109.5°)\n\n0.011975 = 2x^2 - 2x^2 * cos(109.5°)\n\n0.011975 = 2x^2 * (1 - cos(109.5°))\n\nx^2 = 0.011975 / (2 * (1 - cos(109.5°)))\n\nx = sqrt(0.011975 / (2 * (1 - cos(109.5°))))\n\nx ≈ 0.108 nm\n\nSo, the bond length between the carbon and hydrogen atoms in a methane molecule is approximately 0.108 nm."
