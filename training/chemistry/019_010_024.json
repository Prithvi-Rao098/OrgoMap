    "message_1": "What is the standard enthalpy change (in kJ/mol) for the combustion of ethane (C2H6) to form carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) if the reaction is carried out at 25°C and 1 atm of pressure? The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is: \n\nC2H6(g) + 3.5O2(g) → 2CO2(g) + 3H2O(l) \n\nThe standard enthalpies of formation at 25°C are:\n\nΔHf°(CO2) = -393.5 kJ/mol \nΔHf°(H2O) = -285.8 kJ/mol \nΔHf°(C2H6) = -84.7 kJ/mol",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the combustion of ethane, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH° = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants)\n\nFor the products, we have 2 moles of CO2 and 3 moles of H2O:\nΣ ΔHf°(products) = (2 × -393.5 kJ/mol) + (3 × -285.8 kJ/mol) = -787.0 kJ/mol - 857.4 kJ/mol = -1644.4 kJ/mol\n\nFor the reactants, we have 1 mole of C2H6 and 3.5 moles of O2. However, the standard enthalpy of formation for O2 is 0 kJ/mol since it is in its elemental form:\nΣ ΔHf°(reactants) = (1 × -84.7 kJ/mol) + (3.5 × 0 kJ/mol) = -84.7 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction:\nΔH° = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants) = -1644.4 kJ/mol - (-84.7 kJ/mol) = -1559.7 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the combustion of ethane is -1559.7 kJ/mol."
