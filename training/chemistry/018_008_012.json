    "message_2": "The effect of pressure on the reaction rate of the reaction A + B → C can be explained using the collision theory. According to the collision theory, a chemical reaction occurs when reactant molecules collide with each other with sufficient energy and proper orientation. The rate of the reaction depends on the frequency and effectiveness of these collisions.\n\nIn the case of a gaseous reaction, increasing the pressure leads to an increase in the concentration of the reactants. This is because the volume of the system decreases, causing the molecules to be closer together. As a result, the frequency of collisions between the reactant molecules (A and B) increases. With more frequent collisions, there is a higher probability of successful collisions with the required energy and orientation, leading to the formation of product C.\n\nTherefore, increasing the pressure generally increases the reaction rate of the reaction A + B → C. However, it is important to note that this effect is more pronounced for reactions involving multiple gaseous reactants, as the increase in pressure has a more significant impact on the collision frequency in these cases."
