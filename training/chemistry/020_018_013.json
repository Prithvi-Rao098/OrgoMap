    "message_2": "Increasing the concentration of ammonia ligands will shift the equilibrium towards the formation of copper(II) ammonia complex ion, according to Le Chatelier's principle. This is because the reaction will try to counteract the change by consuming the excess ammonia and forming more complex ions.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the formation of the copper(II) ammonia complex ion is:\n\nCu²⁺(aq) + 4NH₃(aq) ⇌ Cu(NH₃)₄²⁺(aq)\n\nTo calculate the equilibrium constant (Kf) for the reaction, we need the equilibrium concentrations of the species involved. Unfortunately, you have not provided the initial or equilibrium concentrations, so I cannot calculate the Kf value for you. However, I can guide you on how to do it.\n\nKf = [Cu(NH₃)₄²⁺] / ([Cu²⁺] * [NH₃]⁴)\n\nWhere:\n- [Cu(NH₃)₄²⁺] is the equilibrium concentration of the copper(II) ammonia complex ion\n- [Cu²⁺] is the equilibrium concentration of the copper(II) ion\n- [NH₃] is the equilibrium concentration of the ammonia ligand\n\nIf you have the equilibrium concentrations, you can plug them into the formula and calculate the Kf value."
