    "message_2": "To calculate the activation energy (Ea) of a reaction, we can use the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk = A * exp(-Ea / R * T)\n\nwhere k is the rate constant, A is the pre-exponential factor, Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol*K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nGiven that the rate constant (k) increases by a factor of 4 when the temperature is increased from 25°C to 50°C, we can set up the following equation:\n\nk2 / k1 = exp(-Ea / R * (1/T1 - 1/T2))\n\nwhere k1 and k2 are the rate constants at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively. Since k2 = 4 * k1, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n4 = exp(-Ea / R * (1/T1 - 1/T2))\n\nFirst, we need to convert the temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin:\n\nT1 = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\nT2 = 50°C + 273.15 = 323.15 K\n\nNow, we can plug the temperatures into the equation:\n\n4 = exp(-Ea / (8.314 * (1/298.15 - 1/323.15)))\n\nTo solve for Ea, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(4) = -Ea / (8.314 * (1/298.15 - 1/323.15))\n\nNow, we can isolate Ea:\n\nEa = -ln(4) * (8.314 * (1/298.15 - 1/323.15))\n\nEa ≈ 19835.6 J/mol\n\nThe activation energy of the reaction is approximately 19.8 kJ/mol."
