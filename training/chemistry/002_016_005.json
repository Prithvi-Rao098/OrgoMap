    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the reaction, we need to use the following equation:\n\nΔH° = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants)\n\nFirst, we need to find the ΔHf° for D(g). We can use the given ΔS° values and the equation:\n\nΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°\n\nSince the reaction is at standard conditions, the temperature (T) is 298 K. We know that at equilibrium, ΔG° = 0. Therefore, we can rearrange the equation to find ΔH° for D(g):\n\nΔH° = TΔS°\n\nΔH° for D(g) = (298 K)(200 J/K•mol) = 59600 J/mol = 59.6 kJ/mol\n\nNow we can calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nΔH° = [3ΔHf°(C) + ΔHf°(D)] - [ΔHf°(A) + 2ΔHf°(B)]\n\nSince we don't have the ΔHf° for B(g), we can't directly calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction. However, we can express the enthalpy change in terms of ΔHf°(B):\n\nΔH° = [3(-50 kJ/mol) + 59.6 kJ/mol] - [-100 kJ/mol + 2ΔHf°(B)]\n\nΔH° = [-150 kJ/mol + 59.6 kJ/mol] - [-100 kJ/mol + 2ΔHf°(B)]\n\nΔH° = -90.4 kJ/mol + 100 kJ/mol - 2ΔHf°(B)\n\nΔH° = 9.6 kJ/mol - 2ΔHf°(B)\n\nWithout the ΔHf° for B(g), we cannot provide a numerical value for the standard enthalpy change of the reaction. The answer is:\n\nΔH° = 9.6 kJ/mol - 2ΔHf°(B)"
