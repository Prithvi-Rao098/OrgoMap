    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the moles of 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) that can be obtained from 50 g of it.\n2. Determine the moles of phenol required for the reaction, considering the 80% yield.\n3. Calculate the moles of nitric acid (HNO₃) needed for the reaction.\n4. Convert the moles of nitric acid to volume (mL) using its density and molar mass.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the moles of 2,4-dinitrophenol\nMolar mass of 2,4-dinitrophenol (C₆H₃N₂O₅) = 6(12.01) + 3(1.01) + 2(14.01) + 5(16.00) = 184.11 g/mol\nMoles of 2,4-dinitrophenol = mass / molar mass = 50 g / 184.11 g/mol = 0.2715 mol\n\nStep 2: Determine the moles of phenol required for the reaction\nConsidering the 80% yield, we need to find the moles of phenol required to produce 0.2715 mol of 2,4-dinitrophenol.\nMoles of phenol = 0.2715 mol / 0.80 = 0.3394 mol\n\nStep 3: Calculate the moles of nitric acid needed for the reaction\nThe balanced chemical equation for the nitration of phenol to 2,4-dinitrophenol is:\nC₆H₅OH + 2 HNO₃ → C₆H₃N₂O₅ + 2 H₂O\nFrom the balanced equation, 2 moles of nitric acid are required for 1 mole of phenol.\nMoles of nitric acid = 0.3394 mol phenol × 2 mol HNO₃ / 1 mol phenol = 0.6788 mol HNO₃\n\nStep 4: Convert the moles of nitric acid to volume (mL)\nAssuming we are using concentrated nitric acid, which typically has a concentration of 15.9 M (15.9 mol/L) and a density of 1.41 g/mL.\nMolar mass of nitric acid (HNO₃) = 1.01 + 14.01 + 3(16.00) = 63.02 g/mol\nVolume of nitric acid = moles / concentration = 0.6788 mol / 15.9 mol/L = 0.0427 L = 42.7 mL\n\nTherefore, 42.7 mL of nitric acid is required to prepare 50 g of 2,4-dinitrophenol from phenol, assuming a yield of 80%."
