    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Van't Hoff equation, which relates the change in temperature to the change in the equilibrium constant (K) for a reaction:\n\nln(K2/K1) = -ΔH°/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere:\n- K1 and K2 are the equilibrium constants at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively\n- ΔH° is the standard enthalpy change for the reaction\n- R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol*K)\n- T1 and T2 are the initial and final temperatures in Kelvin, respectively\n\nFirst, we need to convert the temperature change (10°C) to Kelvin. Since the problem does not provide the initial temperature, we will assume it to be 25°C (298 K), which is a common reference temperature in chemistry.\n\nT1 = 298 K\nT2 = 298 K + 10 K = 308 K\n\nNext, we need to convert the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) and standard entropy change (ΔS°) to the same units. Since R is in J/mol*K, we will convert ΔH° and ΔS° to J/mol:\n\nΔH° = -50 kJ/mol * (1000 J/1 kJ) = -50,000 J/mol\nΔS° = 100 J/mol*K\n\nNow we can calculate the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG°) using the equation:\n\nΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°\n\nSince we are interested in the change in the equilibrium constant, we will calculate ΔG° at both temperatures (T1 and T2):\n\nΔG°(T1) = -50,000 J/mol - (298 K * 100 J/mol*K) = -50,000 J/mol - 29,800 J/mol = -79,800 J/mol\nΔG°(T2) = -50,000 J/mol - (308 K * 100 J/mol*K) = -50,000 J/mol - 30,800 J/mol = -80,800 J/mol\n\nNow we can find the equilibrium constants K1 and K2 using the relationship between ΔG° and K:\n\nΔG° = -RT ln(K)\n\nK1 = exp(-ΔG°(T1) / (R * T1)) = exp(79,800 J/mol / (8.314 J/mol*K * 298 K)) ≈ 1.84 × 10^12\nK2 = exp(-ΔG°(T2) / (R * T2)) = exp(80,800 J/mol / (8.314 J/mol*K * 308 K)) ≈ 3.16 × 10^12\n\nFinally, we can use the Van't Hoff equation to find the change in the equilibrium constant:\n\nln(K2/K1) = -ΔH°/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nln(3.16 × 10^12 / 1.84 × 10^12) = 50,000 J/mol / 8.314 J/mol*K * (1/308 K - 1/298 K)\n\nSolving for the change in the equilibrium constant:\n\nK2 - K1 = 3.16 × 10^12 - 1.84 × 10^12 = 1.32 × 10^12\n\nThe change in the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex ion at a temperature change of 10°C is approximately 1.32 × 10^12."
