    "message_1": "What mass of silver is deposited on a cathode when a current of 4 A is passed for 2 hours through a solution of silver nitrate (AgNO3) using a silver electrode as the anode? The molar mass of Ag is 107.87 g/mol. (Assuming complete electrolysis and no other reactions.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use Faraday's laws of electrolysis. First, we need to determine the number of moles of electrons transferred during the electrolysis process.\n\nThe charge (Q) passed through the solution can be calculated using the formula:\n\nQ = I × t\n\nwhere I is the current (in amperes) and t is the time (in seconds).\n\nGiven that the current is 4 A and the time is 2 hours, we need to convert the time to seconds:\n\n2 hours × (3600 seconds/hour) = 7200 seconds\n\nNow, we can calculate the charge:\n\nQ = 4 A × 7200 s = 28800 Coulombs\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of moles of electrons (n) transferred using the formula:\n\nn = Q / (F × z)\n\nwhere F is Faraday's constant (96485 C/mol) and z is the number of electrons transferred per mole of silver (which is 1, since the reaction is Ag+ + e- → Ag).\n\nn = 28800 C / (96485 C/mol × 1) = 0.2983 mol of electrons\n\nSince the number of moles of electrons is equal to the number of moles of silver deposited, we can now calculate the mass of silver deposited using the molar mass of silver (107.87 g/mol):\n\nmass of silver = 0.2983 mol × 107.87 g/mol = 32.17 g\n\nTherefore, the mass of silver deposited on the cathode is approximately 32.17 grams."
