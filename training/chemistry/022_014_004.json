    "message_1": "A chemistry student has 100 grams of ammonia and 50 grams of oxygen. What is the limiting reactant in the reaction if the balanced equation is:\n\n4NH3 + 3O2 â†’ 2N2 + 6H2O \n\nAnd how much of the other reactant will be left over after the reaction is complete?",
    "message_2": "To determine the limiting reactant, we first need to find the number of moles of each reactant.\n\nThe molar mass of ammonia (NH3) is approximately 14 (N) + 3 * 1 (H) = 17 g/mol.\nThe molar mass of oxygen (O2) is approximately 2 * 16 (O) = 32 g/mol.\n\nNow, we can find the number of moles of each reactant:\n\nmoles of NH3 = 100 g / 17 g/mol = 5.88 mol\nmoles of O2 = 50 g / 32 g/mol = 1.56 mol\n\nNext, we need to compare the mole ratios of the reactants to the balanced equation:\n\nmoles of NH3 / 4 = 5.88 / 4 = 1.47\nmoles of O2 / 3 = 1.56 / 3 = 0.52\n\nSince 0.52 is smaller than 1.47, oxygen (O2) is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow, we need to find out how much ammonia (NH3) will be left over after the reaction is complete. To do this, we can use the mole ratio from the balanced equation:\n\nmoles of NH3 used = (4 moles NH3 / 3 moles O2) * moles of O2\nmoles of NH3 used = (4/3) * 1.56 = 2.08 mol\n\nNow, we can find the moles of NH3 left over:\n\nmoles of NH3 left over = initial moles of NH3 - moles of NH3 used\nmoles of NH3 left over = 5.88 - 2.08 = 3.80 mol\n\nFinally, we can convert the moles of NH3 left over back to grams:\n\ngrams of NH3 left over = moles of NH3 left over * molar mass of NH3\ngrams of NH3 left over = 3.80 mol * 17 g/mol = 64.6 g\n\nSo, the limiting reactant is oxygen (O2), and there will be 64.6 grams of ammonia (NH3) left over after the reaction is complete."
