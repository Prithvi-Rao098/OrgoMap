    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy of formation of water (H2O), we can use the given information and Hess's Law. Hess's Law states that the total enthalpy change for a reaction is the same, regardless of the path taken.\n\nFirst, let's write the balanced chemical equations for the combustion reactions:\n\n1. Combustion of hydrogen gas:\n   H2 (g) + 1/2 O2 (g) → H2O (l)      ΔH = -286 kJ/mol\n\n2. Combustion of carbon:\n   C (s) + O2 (g) → CO2 (g)           ΔH = -394 kJ/mol\n\n3. Combustion of methane gas:\n   CH4 (g) + 2 O2 (g) → CO2 (g) + 2 H2O (l)    ΔH = -890 kJ/mol\n\nWe can use equations 2 and 3 to find the enthalpy change for the formation of water from its elements. First, we need to eliminate CO2 from the equations. To do this, we can reverse equation 2 and add it to equation 3:\n\nReverse equation 2:\n   CO2 (g) → C (s) + O2 (g)           ΔH = +394 kJ/mol\n\nAdd reversed equation 2 to equation 3:\n   CH4 (g) + 2 O2 (g) + CO2 (g) → CO2 (g) + 2 H2O (l) + C (s) + O2 (g)\n   ΔH = -890 kJ/mol + 394 kJ/mol = -496 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation:\n\n   CH4 (g) + O2 (g) → 2 H2O (l) + C (s)\n   ΔH = -496 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we need to eliminate CH4 and C from the equation. To do this, we can use the fact that the standard enthalpy of formation of hydrogen gas (H2) and carbon (C) is 0 kJ/mol. We can write the formation reaction for methane as:\n\n   C (s) + 2 H2 (g) → CH4 (g)      ΔH = 0 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can add this equation to the previous one:\n\n   CH4 (g) + O2 (g) + C (s) + 2 H2 (g) → 2 H2O (l) + C (s) + 2 H2 (g)\n   ΔH = -496 kJ/mol + 0 kJ/mol = -496 kJ/mol\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n   CH4 (g) + O2 (g) → 2 H2O (l)\n   ΔH = -496 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can divide the equation by 2 to find the enthalpy change for the formation of 1 mole of water:\n\n   1/2 CH4 (g) + 1/2 O2 (g) → H2O (l)\n   ΔH = -496 kJ/mol ÷ 2 = -248 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy of formation of water (H2O) is -248 kJ/mol."
