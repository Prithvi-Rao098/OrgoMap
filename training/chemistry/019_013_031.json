Show all calculations and units.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the neutralization reaction, we can use the formula:\n\nΔH_reaction = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH_reaction is the standard enthalpy change for the reaction, ΔH_f(products) is the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation for the products, and ΔH_f(reactants) is the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation for the reactants.\n\nFor this reaction, the products are NaCl(aq) and H2O(l), and the reactants are HCl(aq) and NaOH(aq). Using the given standard enthalpies of formation, we can calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nΔH_reaction = [(-407.3 kJ/mol) + (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [(-167.2 kJ/mol) + (-469.2 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH_reaction = (-693.1 kJ/mol) - (-636.4 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH_reaction = -56.7 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the neutralization reaction between hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide is -56.7 kJ/mol."
