    "message_2": "To calculate the entropy change (∆S) for the reaction, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between hydrogen gas (H2) and oxygen gas (O2):\n\n2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(g)\n\nNext, we need to find the standard molar entropy value for water vapor (H2O). The standard molar entropy value for H2O(g) is 188.8 J/K•mol.\n\nNow we can calculate the entropy change (∆S) for the reaction using the following formula:\n\n∆S = ∑nS(products) - ∑nS(reactants)\n\nwhere n is the number of moles and S is the standard molar entropy value.\n\nFor the reactants, we have:\n\n(2 moles H2 × 130.7 J/K•mol) + (1 mole O2 × 205.0 J/K•mol) = 261.4 J/K + 205.0 J/K = 466.4 J/K\n\nFor the products, we have:\n\n(2 moles H2O × 188.8 J/K•mol) = 377.6 J/K\n\nNow we can calculate the entropy change (∆S):\n\n∆S = 377.6 J/K - 466.4 J/K = -88.8 J/K\n\nThe entropy change for the reaction between 2.0 moles of hydrogen gas (H2) and 1.0 mole of oxygen gas (O2) at constant pressure and a temperature of 298 K is -88.8 J/K."
