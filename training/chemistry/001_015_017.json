    "message_2": "To synthesize benzylamine from benzaldehyde, we can use the following retrosynthesis and organic synthesis techniques:\n\n1. Retrosynthesis: Convert benzylamine to benzaldehyde\nThe target molecule is benzylamine, which can be synthesized from benzaldehyde by reducing the carbonyl group to an amine group. This can be achieved by first converting benzaldehyde to an imine intermediate and then reducing the imine to benzylamine.\n\n2. Organic synthesis: Step-by-step plan\n\nStep 1: Formation of imine intermediate\nReact benzaldehyde with a primary amine, such as ammonia (NH3), to form an imine intermediate. This reaction is called the Schiff base formation.\n\nBenzaldehyde + NH3 → Imine intermediate\n\nMechanism:\na) Nucleophilic attack of the amine nitrogen on the carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde.\nb) Proton transfer from the amine nitrogen to the carbonyl oxygen.\nc) Elimination of water and formation of a double bond between the nitrogen and carbon.\n\nStep 2: Reduction of imine to benzylamine\nReduce the imine intermediate to benzylamine using a reducing agent, such as sodium borohydride (NaBH4) or sodium cyanoborohydride (NaBH3CN).\n\nImine intermediate + Reducing agent → Benzylamine\n\nMechanism:\na) Nucleophilic attack of the hydride ion (H-) from the reducing agent on the imine carbon.\nb) Proton transfer from the nitrogen to the newly added hydrogen, resulting in the formation of benzylamine.\n\nOverall reaction:\nBenzaldehyde + NH3 + Reducing agent → Benzylamine\n\nIn summary, to synthesize benzylamine from benzaldehyde, first form an imine intermediate by reacting benzaldehyde with ammonia, and then reduce the imine intermediate to benzylamine using a reducing agent like sodium borohydride or sodium cyanoborohydride."
