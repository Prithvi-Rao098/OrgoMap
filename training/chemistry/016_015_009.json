    "message_2": "To calculate the total amount of heat absorbed by the water during the process of crystallization, we need to consider two steps: \n\n1. Cooling the water from 70°C to 0°C\n2. Solidifying the water into ice at 0°C\n\nStep 1: Cooling the water from 70°C to 0°C\nTo calculate the heat absorbed during this step, we can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat absorbed, m is the mass of the water, c is the specific heat capacity of water, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nThe specific heat capacity of water is 4.18 J/g°C, the mass of the water is 50 grams, and the change in temperature is 70°C - 0°C = 70°C.\n\nq1 = (50 g)(4.18 J/g°C)(70°C) = 14630 J\n\nStep 2: Solidifying the water into ice at 0°C\nTo calculate the heat absorbed during this step, we can use the formula:\n\nq = mL\n\nwhere q is the heat absorbed, m is the mass of the water, and L is the heat of crystallization.\n\nThe heat of crystallization is given as 333.55 J/g, and the mass of the water is 50 grams.\n\nq2 = (50 g)(333.55 J/g) = 16677.5 J\n\nNow, we can add the heat absorbed in both steps to find the total heat absorbed:\n\nTotal heat absorbed = q1 + q2 = 14630 J + 16677.5 J = 31307.5 J\n\nSo, the total amount of heat absorbed by the 50 grams of water during the process of crystallization is 31,307.5 J."
