    "message_2": "In the ethene molecule (C2H4), the type of hybrid orbitals present in the carbon atoms is sp2 hybridization. In this hybridization, one s orbital and two p orbitals from each carbon atom combine to form three sp2 hybrid orbitals.\n\nThe bond angle between the carbon atoms in ethene is approximately 120 degrees, which is the characteristic bond angle for sp2 hybridized orbitals. This bond angle results from the trigonal planar geometry around each carbon atom."
