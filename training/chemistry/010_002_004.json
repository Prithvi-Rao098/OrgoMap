    "message_2": "In the CH3OH (methanol) molecule, the oxidation state of the carbon atom can be determined by assigning oxidation numbers to each atom in the molecule.\n\n1. Hydrogen has an oxidation number of +1.\n2. Oxygen has an oxidation number of -2.\n\nIn the CH3OH molecule, there are three hydrogen atoms bonded to the carbon atom, and one oxygen atom bonded to the carbon atom as well.\n\nThe oxidation state of carbon can be calculated using the formula:\n\nOxidation state of Carbon (C) = - (sum of oxidation numbers of other atoms)\n\nSo, the oxidation state of carbon in CH3OH is:\n\nOxidation state of C = - [(3 x +1) + (-2)]\n\nOxidation state of C = - (+3 - 2)\n\nOxidation state of C = - (+1)\n\nTherefore, the oxidation state of the carbon atom in the CH3OH molecule is -1."
