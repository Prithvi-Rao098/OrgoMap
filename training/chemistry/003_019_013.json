    "message_2": "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful analytical technique used to determine the structure of organic compounds by analyzing the environment of hydrogen atoms (protons) within the molecule. In the case of ethanol and propanol, the structural difference can be determined by comparing their proton NMR spectra.\n\nEthanol (C2H5OH) has the following structure:\n\nCH3-CH2-OH\n\nPropanol can exist in two isomeric forms: 1-propanol and 2-propanol.\n\n1-propanol (C3H7OH) has the following structure:\n\nCH3-CH2-CH2-OH\n\n2-propanol (C3H7OH) has the following structure:\n\nCH3-CHOH-CH3\n\nIn the proton NMR spectra of these compounds, the hydrogen atoms in different chemical environments will give rise to distinct peaks (signals) with different chemical shifts (measured in ppm).\n\nEthanol:\n1. The CH3 group (3 protons) will give a peak around 1.0-1.5 ppm (methyl group).\n2. The CH2 group (2 protons) will give a peak around 3.5-4.0 ppm (methylene group adjacent to the OH group).\n3. The OH group (1 proton) will give a broad peak around 2.5-5.0 ppm (hydroxyl group).\n\n1-Propanol:\n1. The terminal CH3 group (3 protons) will give a peak around 0.8-1.2 ppm (methyl group).\n2. The middle CH2 group (2 protons) will give a peak around 1.5-2.5 ppm (methylene group adjacent to the terminal CH2 group).\n3. The CH2 group adjacent to the OH group (2 protons) will give a peak around 3.5-4.0 ppm.\n4. The OH group (1 proton) will give a broad peak around 2.5-5.0 ppm (hydroxyl group).\n\n2-Propanol:\n1. The two equivalent CH3 groups (6 protons in total) will give a peak around 1.0-1.5 ppm (methyl groups).\n2. The CH group (1 proton) will give a peak around 3.5-4.5 ppm (methine group adjacent to the OH group).\n3. The OH group (1 proton) will give a broad peak around 2.5-5.0 ppm (hydroxyl group).\n\nBy comparing the proton NMR spectra of ethanol, 1-propanol, and 2-propanol, the structural differences can be identified based on the number of peaks, their chemical shifts, and the integration (proportional to the number of protons) of each peak."
