    "message_2": "The molecular geometry of ammonia (NH3) is trigonal pyramidal. In this structure, the nitrogen atom is the central atom, and it is bonded to three hydrogen atoms. There is also a lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom, which contributes to the overall shape of the molecule.\n\nThe intermolecular forces present in ammonia are hydrogen bonding, dipole-dipole interactions, and London dispersion forces. Hydrogen bonding is the strongest of these forces and occurs due to the highly polar nature of the N-H bond, where the nitrogen atom is more electronegative than the hydrogen atom. This results in a partial negative charge on the nitrogen and a partial positive charge on the hydrogen, allowing for strong hydrogen bonding between ammonia molecules.\n\nThe bond angles in ammonia are approximately 107.5 degrees. This is slightly less than the ideal bond angle of 109.5 degrees in a regular tetrahedral geometry, due to the repulsion between the lone pair of electrons and the bonding pairs of electrons.\n\nThe hybridization of the central nitrogen atom in ammonia is sp3. This occurs because the nitrogen atom forms three sigma bonds with the hydrogen atoms and has one lone pair of electrons. The sp3 hybridization involves the mixing of one s orbital and three p orbitals, resulting in four sp3 hybrid orbitals. These hybrid orbitals are used to form the three N-H sigma bonds and accommodate the lone pair of electrons, giving ammonia its trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry."
