The balanced equation is as follows:\n\nH2(g) + I2(g) → 2HI(g)\n\nAssume a temperature of 298 K and use the following standard molar free energy of formation values:\n\n∆Gf° (HI) = -17.4 kJ/mol\n∆Gf° (H2) = 0 kJ/mol\n∆Gf° (I2) = 0 kJ/mol",
    "message_2": "To calculate the change in Gibbs free energy for the reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\n∆G° = ∑(∆Gf° products) - ∑(∆Gf° reactants)\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\nH2(g) + I2(g) → 2HI(g)\n\nThe products are 2 moles of HI and the reactants are 1 mole of H2 and 1 mole of I2. Using the provided standard molar free energy of formation values, we can plug them into the equation:\n\n∆G° = [2 * (-17.4 kJ/mol)] - [(0 kJ/mol) + (0 kJ/mol)]\n\n∆G° = (-34.8 kJ/mol) - (0 kJ/mol)\n\n∆G° = -34.8 kJ/mol\n\nThe change in Gibbs free energy for the reaction between hydrogen gas and iodine gas that forms hydrogen iodide gas is -34.8 kJ/mol."
