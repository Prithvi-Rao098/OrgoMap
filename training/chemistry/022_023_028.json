    "message_2": "To find the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid, we first need to set up an equilibrium expression using the Ka value. Acetic acid is a weak acid and will partially dissociate in water as follows:\n\nCH3COOH (aq) ⇌ CH3COO- (aq) + H+ (aq)\n\nThe Ka expression for this reaction is:\n\nKa = [CH3COO-][H+] / [CH3COOH]\n\nWe are given the Ka value as 1.8 x 10^-5 and the initial concentration of acetic acid as 0.1 M. Let x be the concentration of CH3COO- and H+ ions at equilibrium. Since the reaction is a 1:1 ratio, the concentration of CH3COOH at equilibrium will be (0.1 - x). Now we can set up the equilibrium expression:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 = (x)(x) / (0.1 - x)\n\nTo simplify the equation, we can make the assumption that x is very small compared to 0.1, so (0.1 - x) ≈ 0.1. This is a valid assumption because acetic acid is a weak acid and does not dissociate completely.\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 ≈ x^2 / 0.1\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx^2 = 1.8 x 10^-5 * 0.1\nx^2 = 1.8 x 10^-6\nx = √(1.8 x 10^-6)\nx ≈ 1.34 x 10^-3\n\nSince x represents the concentration of H+ ions at equilibrium, we can now calculate the pH using the formula:\n\npH = -log[H+]\n\npH = -log(1.34 x 10^-3)\npH ≈ 2.87\n\nTherefore, the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid at 25°C is approximately 2.87."
