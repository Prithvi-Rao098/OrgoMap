The heat of combustion for 1-butene is -2654 kJ/mol and for 2-butene is -2654.4 kJ/mol.",
    "message_2": "To find the enthalpy change of isomerization for the given reaction, we can use the difference in enthalpy of formation between the two isomers:\n\nΔH_isomerization = ΔH_f(2-butene) - ΔH_f(1-butene)\n\nΔH_isomerization = (-44.72 kJ/mol) - (-44.23 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH_isomerization = -0.49 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change of isomerization for the given reaction is -0.49 kJ/mol."
