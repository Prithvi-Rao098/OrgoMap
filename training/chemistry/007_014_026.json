    "message_2": "To develop new anti-inflammatory drugs that specifically target the COX-2 enzyme and avoid negative side effects on the COX-1 enzyme, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Understand the structural differences between COX-1 and COX-2: Both enzymes have similar structures, but there are subtle differences in their active sites. Understanding these differences will help in designing drugs that selectively target COX-2.\n\n2. Computational modeling and virtual screening: Use computational methods, such as molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations, to predict the binding affinity of potential drug candidates to COX-2 and COX-1. This will help in identifying compounds that selectively bind to COX-2 and have minimal interaction with COX-1.\n\n3. High-throughput screening: Develop a high-throughput screening assay to test a large number of compounds for their ability to selectively inhibit COX-2. This will help in identifying potential lead compounds for further optimization.\n\n4. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies: Perform SAR studies to understand the relationship between the chemical structure of the compounds and their biological activity. This will help in optimizing the lead compounds to improve their potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic properties.\n\n5. In vitro and in vivo testing: Test the optimized compounds in vitro for their ability to selectively inhibit COX-2 and evaluate their anti-inflammatory activity. Additionally, test the compounds in animal models of inflammation to assess their efficacy and safety.\n\n6. Clinical trials: Once a promising drug candidate is identified, conduct clinical trials to evaluate its safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics in humans.\n\n7. Post-marketing surveillance: After the drug is approved and marketed, continue to monitor its safety and efficacy in the general population to identify any potential side effects or adverse reactions that were not observed during clinical trials.\n\nBy following these steps, it is possible to develop new anti-inflammatory drugs that specifically target the COX-2 enzyme and avoid negative side effects on the COX-1 enzyme. This will help in providing safer and more effective treatment options for patients suffering from inflammatory conditions."
