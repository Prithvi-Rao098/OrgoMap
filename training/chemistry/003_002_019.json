    "message_2": "To determine the pressure at which water boils at a temperature of 98 °C, we can use the Antoine equation, which is a semi-empirical equation that relates the vapor pressure of a substance to its temperature. For water, the Antoine equation constants are:\n\nA = 8.07131\nB = 1730.63\nC = 233.426\n\nThe Antoine equation is given by:\n\nlog10(P) = A - (B / (T + C))\n\nwhere P is the vapor pressure in mmHg and T is the temperature in °C.\n\nPlugging in the given temperature (T = 98 °C) into the equation:\n\nlog10(P) = 8.07131 - (1730.63 / (98 + 233.426))\n\nlog10(P) = 8.07131 - (1730.63 / 331.426)\n\nlog10(P) = 8.07131 - 5.22097\n\nlog10(P) = 2.85034\n\nNow, we need to find the pressure P:\n\nP = 10^(2.85034)\n\nP ≈ 717.68 mmHg\n\nTo convert this pressure to atmospheres (atm), we can use the conversion factor:\n\n1 atm = 760 mmHg\n\nP(atm) = 717.68 mmHg * (1 atm / 760 mmHg)\n\nP(atm) ≈ 0.9443 atm\n\nSo, the pressure at which water boils at a temperature of 98 °C is approximately 0.9443 atm."
