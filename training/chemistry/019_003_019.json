    "message_1": "What is the heat capacity of 25 grams of water if its temperature rises from 20°C to 50°C?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the heat capacity, we can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat capacity, m is the mass of the substance (in grams), c is the specific heat capacity of the substance (for water, it's 4.18 J/g°C), and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nIn this case, the mass of water (m) is 25 grams, the specific heat capacity (c) is 4.18 J/g°C, and the change in temperature (ΔT) is 50°C - 20°C = 30°C.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nq = (25 g) × (4.18 J/g°C) × (30°C)\n\nq = 25 × 4.18 × 30\n\nq = 3135 J\n\nSo, the heat capacity of 25 grams of water when its temperature rises from 20°C to 50°C is 3135 Joules."
