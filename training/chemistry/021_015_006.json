    "message_2": "The predicted molecular geometry of a molecule with a central atom surrounded by two bonding pairs and two lone pairs of electrons is bent or V-shaped. This prediction is based on the VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) theory, which states that electron pairs around a central atom will arrange themselves to minimize repulsion. In this case, the two lone pairs and two bonding pairs will form a tetrahedral arrangement, but the molecular geometry will only consider the positions of the atoms, resulting in a bent or V-shaped geometry."
