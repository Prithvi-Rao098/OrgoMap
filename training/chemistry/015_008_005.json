    "message_2": "The reaction between ethane and chlorine gas is a radical halogenation reaction, specifically a chlorination reaction. The mechanism for this reaction can be divided into three main steps: initiation, propagation, and termination.\n\n1. Initiation:\nThis step involves the homolytic cleavage of the chlorine-chlorine bond in the chlorine molecule, producing two chlorine radicals. This process can be facilitated by heat or light (UV radiation).\n\nCl2 → 2 Cl•\n\n2. Propagation:\nThe propagation step consists of two sub-steps:\n\na) The chlorine radical reacts with ethane, abstracting a hydrogen atom and forming a methyl radical and hydrogen chloride (HCl).\n\nCH3-CH3 + Cl• → CH3-CH2• + HCl\n\nb) The methyl radical reacts with another chlorine molecule, forming chloroethane and another chlorine radical.\n\nCH3-CH2• + Cl2 → CH3-CH2Cl + Cl•\n\nThe chlorine radical produced in this step can then react with more ethane molecules, propagating the chain reaction.\n\n3. Termination:\nThe termination step occurs when two radicals react with each other, forming a stable molecule and ending the chain reaction. This can happen in several ways, such as:\n\na) Two chlorine radicals reacting with each other:\nCl• + Cl• → Cl2\n\nb) Two methyl radicals reacting with each other:\nCH3-CH2• + CH3-CH2• → CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3 (butane)\n\nc) A chlorine radical reacting with a methyl radical:\nCH3-CH2• + Cl• → CH3-CH2Cl (chloroethane)\n\nThe presence of a catalyst can affect the selectivity of the reaction by promoting the formation of specific products. For example, in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, such as aluminum chloride (AlCl3), the reaction can be directed towards the formation of a specific isomer or a more highly substituted product. The catalyst can stabilize the intermediate radicals, lowering the activation energy and increasing the reaction rate. However, it is important to note that radical chlorination of alkanes, like ethane, is generally less selective than bromination or iodination due to the high reactivity of chlorine radicals."
