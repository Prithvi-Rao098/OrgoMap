    "message_2": "A Geiger-Müller counter, also known as a Geiger counter, is a device used to detect and measure ionizing radiation such as alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays. It was invented by Hans Geiger and Walther Müller in 1928. The device consists of a Geiger-Müller tube, an electronic processing system, and a display or audio output to indicate the presence and intensity of radiation.\n\nThe Geiger-Müller tube is the main component responsible for detecting radiation. It is a gas-filled tube, typically containing a mixture of inert gases like argon or neon, and a small amount of a halogen gas, such as bromine or chlorine. The tube has a central electrode (anode) made of a thin wire, surrounded by a cylindrical metal electrode (cathode). The anode and cathode are connected to a high voltage power supply, creating an electric field within the tube.\n\nWhen ionizing radiation enters the Geiger-Müller tube, it interacts with the gas molecules, causing ionization. This process produces free electrons and positively charged ions. The electric field within the tube accelerates the free electrons towards the anode, while the positive ions move towards the cathode. As the electrons gain kinetic energy, they collide with other gas molecules, causing further ionization and creating an avalanche of electrons. This process is called the Townsend avalanche.\n\nThe avalanche of electrons creates a brief pulse of electric current, which is detected by the electronic processing system. The current pulse is then amplified and converted into a count, which is displayed on the counter or indicated by an audible click. The number of counts per unit of time (e.g., counts per minute or counts per second) is proportional to the intensity of the radiation.\n\nThe Geiger-Müller counter is sensitive to various types of ionizing radiation, but it cannot differentiate between them. Additional accessories, such as filters or specific tube designs, can be used to selectively detect certain types of radiation. For example, a thin window at the end of the tube can allow alpha particles to enter, while a thicker metal casing can block alpha and beta particles, allowing only gamma rays to be detected.\n\nIn summary, a Geiger-Müller counter works by detecting ionizing radiation through the ionization of gas molecules within a Geiger-Müller tube. The resulting avalanche of electrons creates a current pulse, which is processed and displayed as a count, indicating the presence and intensity of radiation."
