    "message_2": "To determine the equilibrium constant, K, for the reaction of iodine (I2) with thiosulfate (S2O3²⁻) in an aqueous solution under acidic conditions, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\n2 S2O3²⁻(aq) + I2(aq) ⇌ S4O6²⁻(aq) + 2 I⁻(aq)\n\nNow, we can write the expression for the equilibrium constant, K:\n\nK = [S4O6²⁻][I⁻]² / ([S2O3²⁻]²[I2])\n\nHowever, the equilibrium constant, K, for this reaction is not a fixed value. It depends on factors such as temperature, pressure, and the specific conditions of the reaction. To determine the exact value of K, you would need to perform experiments under controlled conditions and measure the concentrations of the reactants and products at equilibrium.\n\nAlternatively, you can look up the value of K in a reference source, such as a chemistry textbook or database, for the specific conditions of your reaction."
