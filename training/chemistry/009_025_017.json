    "message_2": "To determine the chemical structure of the unknown molecule with a molecular formula C6H12O2 using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), we need to analyze the proton (1H) and carbon (13C) NMR spectra. Since the actual spectra are not provided, I will give a general approach to solving this problem.\n\n1. Analyze the 1H NMR spectrum:\n- Look for the number of distinct peaks, which represent different types of protons in the molecule.\n- Determine the integration of each peak, which indicates the relative number of protons in each environment.\n- Examine the splitting patterns (multiplicity) of the peaks, which can provide information about the number of neighboring protons.\n- Identify the chemical shifts of the peaks, which can give clues about the functional groups present in the molecule.\n\n2. Analyze the 13C NMR spectrum:\n- Count the number of distinct peaks, which represent different types of carbons in the molecule.\n- Identify the chemical shifts of the peaks, which can provide information about the types of carbons and their bonding environments.\n\n3. Combine the information from both spectra to propose a structure:\n- Use the molecular formula (C6H12O2) and the information from the NMR spectra to deduce the functional groups and connectivity of the atoms.\n- Consider possible isomers and compare their expected NMR spectra with the given data.\n\nFor example, if the 1H NMR spectrum shows a peak around 12 ppm (indicative of a carboxylic acid proton), a peak around 2 ppm (indicative of a methyl group next to a carbonyl), and a peak around 1.5 ppm (indicative of a methylene group), we can deduce that the molecule might be a carboxylic acid ester. The 13C NMR spectrum would further support this if it shows a peak around 170 ppm (carbonyl carbon) and peaks around 60 ppm (ester carbon).\n\nBased on this information, one possible structure for the unknown molecule with a molecular formula C6H12O2 could be an ester like ethyl butanoate (CH3CH2COOCH2CH3). However, without the actual NMR spectra, it is not possible to definitively determine the structure of the unknown molecule."
