The standard enthalpies of formation for HCl (aq), NaOH (aq), NaCl (aq), and H2O (l) are -92.31 kJ/mol, -469.14 kJ/mol, -407.76 kJ/mol, and -285.83 kJ/mol, respectively.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH° = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH° is the standard enthalpy change, and ΔHf° is the standard enthalpy of formation.\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\nHCl (aq) + NaOH (aq) → NaCl (aq) + H2O (l)\n\nΔH° = [ΔHf°(NaCl) + ΔHf°(H2O)] - [ΔHf°(HCl) + ΔHf°(NaOH)]\n\nSubstitute the given standard enthalpies of formation:\n\nΔH° = [(-407.76 kJ/mol) + (-285.83 kJ/mol)] - [(-92.31 kJ/mol) + (-469.14 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH° = (-693.59 kJ/mol) - (-561.45 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH° = 132.14 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the reaction of hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide to form sodium chloride and water is 132.14 kJ/mol."
