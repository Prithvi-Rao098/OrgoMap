    "message_2": "To determine the purity of the aspirin sample obtained from a lab experiment, you will need to compare its melting point with the known melting point of pure aspirin. Pure aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) has a melting point of approximately 135°C.\n\nHere's how you can determine the purity of the aspirin sample:\n\n1. Measure the melting point of the aspirin sample using a melting point apparatus. This involves heating the sample in a capillary tube and observing the temperature at which it starts to melt and the temperature at which it completely melts.\n\n2. Compare the measured melting point of the sample with the known melting point of pure aspirin (135°C).\n\nIf the melting point of the sample is close to 135°C and has a narrow melting range (less than 2°C difference between the start and end of melting), the sample is likely to be relatively pure. If the melting point is significantly lower than 135°C or has a wide melting range, it indicates the presence of impurities in the sample.\n\nKeep in mind that this method provides an estimation of the purity of the aspirin sample, and other analytical techniques such as chromatography or spectroscopy may be needed for a more accurate determination of purity."
