    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy change for the neutralization reaction, we can use Hess's Law and the standard enthalpies of formation for the compounds involved in the reaction. Hess's Law states that the total enthalpy change for a reaction is the sum of the enthalpy changes for each step in the reaction.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) for the compounds involved in the reaction. The standard enthalpies of formation are as follows:\n\nHCl (aq): -167.2 kJ/mol\nNaOH (aq): -469.15 kJ/mol\nNaCl (aq): -407.27 kJ/mol\nH2O (l): -285.83 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can use Hess's Law to find the standard enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nΔH° = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants)\n\nΔH° = [(-407.27 kJ/mol) + (-285.83 kJ/mol)] - [(-167.2 kJ/mol) + (-469.15 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH° = (-693.1 kJ/mol) - (-636.35 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH° = -56.75 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the neutralization of hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide to form sodium chloride and water under standard conditions is -56.75 kJ/mol."
