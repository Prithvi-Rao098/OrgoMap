    "message_2": "To find the density of sodium chloride (NaCl) at 25°C, we can use the formula:\n\nDensity = Mass / Volume\n\nGiven the mass of NaCl is 75g and the volume is 50mL, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nDensity = 75g / 50mL\n\nDensity = 1.5 g/mL\n\nSo, the density of sodium chloride (NaCl) at 25°C with a mass of 75g and a volume of 50mL is 1.5 g/mL."
