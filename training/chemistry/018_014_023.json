    "message_2": "In a first-order reaction, the reaction rate is directly proportional to the concentration of one reactant. This means that if the concentration of the reactant is increased, the reaction rate will also increase. Conversely, if the concentration of the reactant is decreased, the reaction rate will decrease. This relationship can be represented by the rate law equation for a first-order reaction:\n\nRate = k[A]\n\nwhere Rate is the reaction rate, k is the rate constant, and [A] is the concentration of the reactant A. As the concentration of A changes, the reaction rate will change accordingly."
