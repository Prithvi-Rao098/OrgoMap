    "message_1": "What are the equilibrium concentrations of reactants and products, given the following reaction and initial concentrations?\n\n2NO2(g) ⇌ N2O4(g)\n\nInitial concentrations: [NO2] = 0.20 M and [N2O4] = 0.10 M. The equilibrium constant for the reaction is Kc = 4.2 x 10^-3 at 25°C.",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium concentrations, we can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table and use the given equilibrium constant (Kc).\n\nInitial concentrations:\n[NO2] = 0.20 M\n[N2O4] = 0.10 M\n\nChange in concentrations:\nLet x be the change in concentration of N2O4. Then, the change in concentration of NO2 will be 2x (since the stoichiometry is 2:1).\n\nEquilibrium concentrations:\n[NO2] = 0.20 M - 2x\n[N2O4] = 0.10 M + x\n\nNow, we can set up the equilibrium expression using Kc:\n\nKc = [N2O4] / [NO2]^2\n4.2 x 10^-3 = (0.10 + x) / (0.20 - 2x)^2\n\nTo solve for x, we can first try to simplify the equation:\n\n4.2 x 10^-3 (0.20 - 2x)^2 = 0.10 + x\n\nNow, we can solve for x using a quadratic equation solver or by making an assumption that x is small compared to the initial concentrations (which is often the case when Kc is small). In this case, we can approximate the equation as:\n\n4.2 x 10^-3 (0.20)^2 = x\n\nx ≈ 0.0168\n\nNow, we can find the equilibrium concentrations:\n\n[NO2] = 0.20 M - 2(0.0168) ≈ 0.1664 M\n[N2O4] = 0.10 M + 0.0168 ≈ 0.1168 M\n\nSo, the equilibrium concentrations are approximately [NO2] = 0.1664 M and [N2O4] = 0.1168 M."
