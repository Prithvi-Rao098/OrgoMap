    "message_1": "What is the effect on the equilibrium constant (Kc) of the following equilibrium reaction when the temperature is increased from 250°C to 400°C? \n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g) \n\nGiven that the equilibrium constant (Kc) for this reaction is 4.34 x 10^-3 at 250°C.",
    "message_2": "To determine the effect of temperature on the equilibrium constant (Kc) for this reaction, we need to consider the reaction's enthalpy change (ΔH). The formation of ammonia (NH3) from nitrogen (N2) and hydrogen (H2) is an exothermic reaction, meaning it releases heat (ΔH < 0).\n\nAccording to Le Chatelier's principle, if the temperature of an exothermic reaction is increased, the equilibrium will shift towards the reactants to counteract the change. In other words, the reaction will favor the reverse (endothermic) process to absorb the excess heat.\n\nAs a result, when the temperature is increased from 250°C to 400°C, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction will decrease. This means that at the higher temperature, there will be a lower concentration of ammonia (NH3) at equilibrium, and a higher concentration of nitrogen (N2) and hydrogen (H2).\n\nHowever, without additional information such as the reaction's enthalpy change (ΔH) or the equilibrium constant (Kc) at 400°C, we cannot provide a specific numerical value for the new Kc."
