    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy of formation of CaCO3, we can use Hess's Law, which states that the total enthalpy change for a reaction is the same, regardless of the pathway taken. We can manipulate the given reactions and their enthalpies to obtain the desired reaction.\n\nFirst, let's write down the desired reaction:\n\nCaO + CO2 → CaCO3    ΔHf° = ?\n\nNow, we need to manipulate the given reactions to obtain the desired reaction. We can do this by reversing the first reaction and dividing it by 2:\n\n2CaO → 2Ca + O2     ΔHf° = +1269 kJ/mol (reversed reaction)\nCaO → Ca + 1/2 O2     ΔHf° = +634.5 kJ/mol (divided by 2)\n\nNext, we need to reverse the second reaction and divide it by 2:\n\n2CO2 → 2CO + O2     ΔHf° = +566 kJ/mol (reversed reaction)\nCO2 → CO + 1/2 O2     ΔHf° = +283 kJ/mol (divided by 2)\n\nNow, we can add the modified first and second reactions:\n\nCaO → Ca + 1/2 O2     ΔHf° = +634.5 kJ/mol\nCO2 → CO + 1/2 O2     ΔHf° = +283 kJ/mol\n----------------------------------------------\nCaO + CO2 → Ca + CO + O2    ΔHf° = +917.5 kJ/mol\n\nFinally, we need to add the third reaction to the modified reactions:\n\nCaO + CO2 → Ca + CO + O2    ΔHf° = +917.5 kJ/mol\nCa + CO + O2 → CaCO3          ΔHf° = ?\n\nBy adding these reactions, we get:\n\nCaO + CO2 → CaCO3    ΔHf° = -917.5 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy of formation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) is -917.5 kJ/mol."
