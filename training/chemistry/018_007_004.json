    "message_1": "What is the effect of increased surface area on the reaction rate of magnesium with hydrochloric acid?",
    "message_2": "An increase in surface area of magnesium will lead to an increase in the reaction rate with hydrochloric acid. This is because a larger surface area allows for more particles to be exposed and available for collisions with the hydrochloric acid molecules. As a result, there will be more frequent successful collisions between the reactants, leading to a faster rate of reaction. This principle is generally applicable to many chemical reactions involving solid reactants."
