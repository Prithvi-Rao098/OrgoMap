    "message_2": "To calculate the change in entropy (ΔS) of a closed system undergoing an irreversible expansion at constant pressure, we can use the formula:\n\nΔS = n * R * ln(V2/V1)\n\nwhere:\n- n is the number of moles of the ideal gas\n- R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\n- V1 is the initial volume\n- V2 is the final volume\n- ln is the natural logarithm\n\nGiven that the initial and final volumes are V1 and V2, respectively, the change in entropy can be calculated by plugging these values into the formula. Note that the number of moles (n) and the temperature (T) are not provided in the problem, so the answer will be in terms of n, R, V1, and V2."
