    "message_2": "The dissociation of acetic acid (CH3COOH) in water can be represented by the following chemical equation:\n\nCH3COOH (aq) ⇌ CH3COO- (aq) + H+ (aq)\n\nThe equilibrium constant expression for this reaction is given by:\n\nK_a = [CH3COO-][H+]/[CH3COOH]\n\nGiven that the pH of the solution is 4.5, we can find the concentration of H+ ions:\n\npH = -log[H+]\n4.5 = -log[H+]\n[H+] = 10^(-4.5) = 3.16 x 10^(-5) M\n\nLet x be the change in concentration of CH3COOH, CH3COO-, and H+ at equilibrium. Then:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.1 - x\n[CH3COO-] = x\n[H+] = 3.16 x 10^(-5) + x\n\nSince the initial concentration of acetic acid is much larger than the concentration of H+ ions, we can assume that x is small compared to 0.1 M. Therefore, we can approximate [CH3COOH] ≈ 0.1 M. Now, we can substitute these values into the K_a expression:\n\nK_a = (x)(3.16 x 10^(-5) + x)/(0.1)\n\nSince x is small, we can also assume that 3.16 x 10^(-5) + x ≈ 3.16 x 10^(-5). Now, we can solve for K_a:\n\nK_a = (x)(3.16 x 10^(-5))/(0.1)\nx = [CH3COO-] = [H+] - 3.16 x 10^(-5) = 3.16 x 10^(-5) M (since x is small)\n\nK_a = (3.16 x 10^(-5))(3.16 x 10^(-5))/(0.1) = 1.00 x 10^(-9)\n\nThe equilibrium constant value (K_a) for the dissociation of acetic acid in water is approximately 1.00 x 10^(-9)."
