    "message_2": "There are three structural isomers possible for the molecular formula C5H12. They are:\n\n1. n-Pentane:\nStructure: CH3-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3\nName: n-Pentane (normal pentane)\n\n2. Isopentane (2-methylbutane):\nStructure: (CH3)2CH-CH2-CH3\nName: Isopentane (2-methylbutane)\n\n3. Neopentane (2,2-dimethylpropane):\nStructure: (CH3)3C-CH3\nName: Neopentane (2,2-dimethylpropane)\n\nThese three isomers have the same molecular formula but different structural arrangements of carbon and hydrogen atoms."
