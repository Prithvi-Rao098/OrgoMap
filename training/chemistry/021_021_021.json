    "message_2": "The hybridization of the carbon atoms in the molecule C2H4 (ethene) is sp2. Each carbon atom is bonded to three other atoms: two hydrogen atoms and one carbon atom. This requires three hybrid orbitals, which are formed by the combination of one 2s orbital and two 2p orbitals in each carbon atom, resulting in the sp2 hybridization."
