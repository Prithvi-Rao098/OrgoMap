    "message_2": "The oxidation product of an aldehyde is a carboxylic acid, while ketones are generally resistant to oxidation under mild conditions. However, under strong oxidizing conditions, ketones can be converted to carboxylic acids or cleaved to form smaller carboxylic acids.\n\nTo identify the oxidation product of an aldehyde, you can use the Tollens' test. Tollens' reagent, also known as ammoniacal silver nitrate, is prepared by mixing silver nitrate (AgNO3) with aqueous ammonia (NH3) until a clear solution is obtained. When an aldehyde is treated with Tollens' reagent, it gets oxidized to a carboxylic acid, while the silver ions in the reagent are reduced to metallic silver (Ag). This results in the formation of a silver mirror on the inner surface of the test tube, which is a positive result for the presence of an aldehyde.\n\nKetones do not react with Tollens' reagent, so the absence of a silver mirror indicates that the compound is likely a ketone or a compound that does not contain an aldehyde functional group.\n\nTo identify the oxidation product of a ketone, you can use the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation test. In this test, a ketone is treated with a peroxyacid, such as meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA) or peracetic acid. The reaction results in the formation of an ester, which can be identified by its characteristic odor or by hydrolyzing it to form a carboxylic acid and an alcohol, which can be further analyzed using various chemical tests."
