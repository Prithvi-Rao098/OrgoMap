    "message_2": "To calculate the number of electrons transferred in the reaction, we first need to determine the oxidation states of the elements involved in the reaction.\n\nIn the reactants:\nCu(s) has an oxidation state of 0 (since it is in its elemental form).\nAg in AgNO3 has an oxidation state of +1 (since NO3 has an oxidation state of -1 and there are two of them).\n\nIn the products:\nCu in Cu(NO3)2 has an oxidation state of +2 (since NO3 has an oxidation state of -1 and there are two of them).\nAg(s) has an oxidation state of 0 (since it is in its elemental form).\n\nNow, let's identify the changes in oxidation states:\nCu goes from 0 to +2, which means it loses 2 electrons (oxidation).\nAg goes from +1 to 0, which means it gains 1 electron (reduction).\n\nSince there are 2 Ag atoms involved in the reaction, a total of 2 electrons are gained by the 2 Ag atoms.\n\nTherefore, the number of electrons transferred in this reaction is 2."
