    "message_2": "The inorganic compound formed between Sodium (Na) and Chlorine (Cl) is Sodium Chloride (NaCl). Based on their electronegativity values, Sodium has an electronegativity of 0.93, while Chlorine has an electronegativity of 3.16. The difference in electronegativity between these two elements is 3.16 - 0.93 = 2.23.\n\nSince the electronegativity difference is greater than 1.7, the bond formed between Sodium and Chlorine is an ionic bond. In an ionic bond, one atom (in this case, Sodium) loses an electron to become a positively charged ion (cation), while the other atom (Chlorine) gains an electron to become a negatively charged ion (anion). In the case of NaCl, Sodium loses one electron to become Na+ and Chlorine gains one electron to become Cl-. The electrostatic attraction between the oppositely charged ions forms the ionic bond, resulting in the formation of the inorganic compound Sodium Chloride (NaCl)."
