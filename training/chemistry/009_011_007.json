    "message_1": "What is the age of a rock sample containing a radioactive isotope with a half-life of 1 million years, if the ratio of the radioactive isotope to its decay product is 1:7?",
    "message_2": "To determine the age of the rock sample, we can use the formula:\n\nN = N0 * (1/2)^(t / T)\n\nWhere:\nN = remaining amount of the radioactive isotope\nN0 = initial amount of the radioactive isotope\nt = time elapsed (age of the rock)\nT = half-life of the radioactive isotope\n\nIn this case, we are given the ratio of the radioactive isotope to its decay product, which is 1:7. This means that for every 1 unit of the radioactive isotope, there are 7 units of the decay product. Therefore, the total initial amount of the radioactive isotope (N0) would be the sum of the remaining radioactive isotope and the decay product, which is 1 + 7 = 8 units.\n\nNow we can rewrite the formula as:\n\n1 = 8 * (1/2)^(t / 1,000,000)\n\nTo solve for t, we can first divide both sides by 8:\n\n1/8 = (1/2)^(t / 1,000,000)\n\nNow we can take the logarithm base 1/2 of both sides:\n\nlog_(1/2) (1/8) = t / 1,000,000\n\nSince log_(1/2) (1/8) = 3, we have:\n\n3 = t / 1,000,000\n\nNow we can solve for t:\n\nt = 3 * 1,000,000\nt = 3,000,000 years\n\nSo the age of the rock sample is 3 million years."
