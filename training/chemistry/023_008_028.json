    "message_2": "The reaction of aniline (C6H5NH2) with nitric acid (HNO3) to form p-nitroaniline (C6H4(NO2)NH2) is an example of electrophilic aromatic substitution, specifically nitration. The mechanism involves the following steps:\n\n1. Protonation of nitric acid by sulfuric acid:\nSulfuric acid (H2SO4) acts as a strong acid and protonates nitric acid, forming the nitronium ion (NO2+), which is a strong electrophile. The reaction is as follows:\nHNO3 + H2SO4 -> NO2+ + HSO4- + H2O\n\n2. Formation of the sigma complex (arenium ion):\nThe electrophile, NO2+, attacks the aromatic ring of aniline, resulting in the formation of a sigma complex (arenium ion). This step involves the breaking of aromaticity, which is energetically unfavorable. However, the intermediate is stabilized by resonance.\n\n3. Proton loss and regeneration of aromaticity:\nThe sigma complex loses a proton to the HSO4- ion, which regenerates sulfuric acid and restores the aromaticity of the ring, forming the p-nitroaniline product.\n\nThe role of sulfuric acid in this reaction is twofold:\n1. It protonates nitric acid to generate the nitronium ion (NO2+), the electrophile needed for the reaction.\n2. It acts as a catalyst, being regenerated at the end of the reaction, and thus is not consumed in the overall process.\n\nIt is important to note that aniline is an activating group, which directs electrophilic substitution to the ortho and para positions. However, due to steric hindrance, the para position is favored, and p-nitroaniline is the major product."
