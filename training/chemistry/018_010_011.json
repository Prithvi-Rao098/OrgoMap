    "message_2": "The rate of reaction between hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and iodide ion (I-) can be affected by the change in pH. This reaction is typically catalyzed by an acid, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl), and is known as the iodine clock reaction. The overall reaction can be represented as:\n\nH2O2 + 2I- + 2H+ â†’ I2 + 2H2O\n\nAs the pH of the solution changes, the concentration of H+ ions in the solution also changes. The pH is defined as the negative logarithm of the H+ ion concentration:\n\npH = -log10[H+]\n\nWhen the pH decreases (becomes more acidic), the concentration of H+ ions increases. This increase in H+ ions leads to a faster rate of reaction between hydrogen peroxide and iodide ion, as the reaction is acid-catalyzed. Conversely, when the pH increases (becomes more basic), the concentration of H+ ions decreases, resulting in a slower rate of reaction.\n\nIn summary, the rate of reaction between hydrogen peroxide and iodide ion is directly proportional to the concentration of H+ ions in the solution. As the pH decreases (more acidic), the rate of reaction increases, and as the pH increases (more basic), the rate of reaction decreases."
