    "message_2": "To find the wavelength of the photon emitted during the transition, we can use the energy-wavelength relationship given by the Planck's equation:\n\nE = h * c / λ\n\nwhere E is the energy of the photon, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), c is the speed of light (3.0 x 10^8 m/s), and λ is the wavelength of the photon.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the energy difference from electron volts (eV) to joules (J). The conversion factor is 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J.\n\nEnergy difference in joules:\nE = 2.5 eV * (1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV) = 4.005 x 10^-19 J\n\nNow, we can rearrange the Planck's equation to solve for the wavelength:\n\nλ = h * c / E\n\nSubstitute the values:\n\nλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (3.0 x 10^8 m/s) / (4.005 x 10^-19 J)\n\nλ = 4.963 x 10^-7 m\n\nTo express the wavelength in nanometers (nm), we can convert meters to nanometers using the conversion factor 1 m = 10^9 nm:\n\nλ = 4.963 x 10^-7 m * (10^9 nm/m) = 496.3 nm\n\nSo, the wavelength of the photon emitted during the transition is approximately 496.3 nm."
