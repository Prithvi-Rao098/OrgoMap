    "message_2": "The effect of molecular orbital symmetry on the regioselectivity of Diels-Alder reactions between conjugated dienes and dienophiles is governed by the Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) Theory. According to this theory, the reaction occurs between the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of the diene and the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) of the dienophile. The interaction between these orbitals must be symmetry-allowed, meaning that their symmetry properties must be compatible for a reaction to occur.\n\nIn the case of the Diels-Alder reaction between 1,3-butadiene and maleic anhydride, the regioselectivity can be predicted using quantum chemical calculations. These calculations involve determining the energies and shapes of the HOMO of 1,3-butadiene and the LUMO of maleic anhydride, and analyzing their interactions.\n\n1,3-butadiene has a HOMO that is symmetric with respect to the central double bond, while maleic anhydride has a LUMO that is antisymmetric with respect to the central double bond. The interaction between these orbitals is most favorable when the electron-rich part of the diene's HOMO interacts with the electron-poor part of the dienophile's LUMO.\n\nBased on these considerations, the major product formed in the reaction between 1,3-butadiene and maleic anhydride can be predicted. The most favorable interaction occurs when the terminal carbon of the 1,3-butadiene (carbon 1) interacts with the less-substituted carbon of the maleic anhydride (carbon 2). This leads to the formation of the endo product, which is a bicyclic compound with a six-membered ring and an anhydride group on the bridge.\n\nIn summary, molecular orbital symmetry plays a crucial role in determining the regioselectivity of Diels-Alder reactions. By analyzing the interactions between the HOMO of the diene and the LUMO of the dienophile, the major product of the reaction between 1,3-butadiene and maleic anhydride can be predicted as the endo bicyclic compound."
