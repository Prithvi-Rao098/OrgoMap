    "message_2": "Temperature plays a significant role in the enzymatic activity of lactase in breaking down lactose in milk. Enzymes, including lactase, are proteins that act as biological catalysts, speeding up chemical reactions without being consumed in the process. They have an optimal temperature at which they function most efficiently.\n\n1. Low temperatures: At low temperatures, the kinetic energy of the enzyme and substrate molecules is reduced, resulting in fewer collisions between them. This leads to a slower rate of lactose breakdown by lactase. As the temperature increases, the kinetic energy of the molecules also increases, leading to more frequent collisions and a higher rate of enzymatic activity.\n\n2. Optimal temperature: Each enzyme has an optimal temperature at which it functions most efficiently. For lactase, this optimal temperature is typically around 37°C (98.6°F), which is the normal body temperature of humans. At this temperature, the enzyme has the highest rate of lactose breakdown, providing the most efficient digestion of lactose in milk.\n\n3. High temperatures: As the temperature continues to increase beyond the optimal temperature, the enzyme's structure begins to denature or break down. The bonds holding the enzyme's three-dimensional shape together become unstable, causing the enzyme to lose its specific shape and, consequently, its ability to bind to the lactose substrate. This results in a decrease in enzymatic activity and eventually complete inactivation of the enzyme if the temperature is too high.\n\nIn summary, temperature has a significant impact on the enzymatic activity of lactase in breaking down lactose in milk. The enzyme functions most efficiently at its optimal temperature, with reduced activity at lower temperatures and potential denaturation at higher temperatures."
