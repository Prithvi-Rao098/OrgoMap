Given that the mass of the two protons is 2.014102 atomic mass units (amu) each, and the mass of two neutrons is 1.008665 amu each, while the mass of a helium-4 nucleus is 4.002603 amu.",
    "message_2": "To find the nuclear binding energy, we first need to determine the mass defect. The mass defect is the difference between the total mass of the individual protons and neutrons and the mass of the helium-4 nucleus.\n\nMass of 2 protons = 2 * 2.014102 amu = 4.028204 amu\nMass of 2 neutrons = 2 * 1.008665 amu = 2.017330 amu\nTotal mass of protons and neutrons = 4.028204 amu + 2.017330 amu = 6.045534 amu\n\nMass defect = Total mass of protons and neutrons - Mass of helium-4 nucleus\nMass defect = 6.045534 amu - 4.002603 amu = 2.042931 amu\n\nNow, we need to convert the mass defect to energy. We can do this using Einstein's famous equation, E=mc^2, where E is the energy, m is the mass, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3.00 x 10^8 m/s). However, we need to convert the mass defect from atomic mass units (amu) to kilograms (kg) first.\n\n1 amu = 1.660539 x 10^-27 kg\nMass defect in kg = 2.042931 amu * 1.660539 x 10^-27 kg/amu = 3.3928 x 10^-27 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the nuclear binding energy:\n\nE = mc^2\nE = (3.3928 x 10^-27 kg) * (3.00 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nE = 3.052 x 10^-12 Joules\n\nSo, the nuclear binding energy released when a nucleus of helium-4 is formed by combining two protons and two neutrons is approximately 3.052 x 10^-12 Joules."
