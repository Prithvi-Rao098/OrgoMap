    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy of formation for propane gas (C3H8), we can use the standard enthalpy of combustion and the standard enthalpies of formation for carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). The balanced combustion reaction for propane is:\n\nC3H8 (g) + 5O2 (g) → 3CO2 (g) + 4H2O (l)\n\nThe standard enthalpy of combustion for propane is the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation for the products minus the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation for the reactants:\n\nΔH_combustion = [3ΔHf(CO2) + 4ΔHf(H2O)] - [ΔHf(C3H8) + 5ΔHf(O2)]\n\nSince the standard enthalpy of formation for O2 is zero (it is in its elemental form), the equation simplifies to:\n\n-2220.1 kJ/mol = [3(-393.5 kJ/mol) + 4(-285.8 kJ/mol)] - ΔHf(C3H8)\n\nNow, we can solve for the standard enthalpy of formation for propane (ΔHf(C3H8)):\n\nΔHf(C3H8) = [3(-393.5 kJ/mol) + 4(-285.8 kJ/mol)] + 2220.1 kJ/mol\nΔHf(C3H8) = (-1180.5 kJ/mol) + (-1143.2 kJ/mol) + 2220.1 kJ/mol\nΔHf(C3H8) = -103.6 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation for propane gas (C3H8) is approximately -103.6 kJ/mol."
