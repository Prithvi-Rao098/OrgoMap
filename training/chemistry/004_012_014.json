    "message_2": "To determine the percentage composition of copper, carbon, and oxygen in a sample of copper carbonate, we first need to know the molecular formula of copper carbonate. Copper carbonate exists in two forms: basic copper carbonate (CuCO3·Cu(OH)2) and normal copper carbonate (CuCO3). I will assume you are referring to normal copper carbonate (CuCO3) for this problem.\n\n1. Calculate the molar mass of copper carbonate (CuCO3):\nCu: 63.55 g/mol\nC: 12.01 g/mol\nO: 16.00 g/mol (3 oxygen atoms in the formula)\n\nMolar mass of CuCO3 = 63.55 + 12.01 + (3 × 16.00) = 63.55 + 12.01 + 48.00 = 123.56 g/mol\n\n2. Calculate the percentage composition of each element in copper carbonate:\nPercentage of copper (Cu) = (mass of Cu / molar mass of CuCO3) × 100\n= (63.55 / 123.56) × 100 = 51.45%\n\nPercentage of carbon (C) = (mass of C / molar mass of CuCO3) × 100\n= (12.01 / 123.56) × 100 = 9.72%\n\nPercentage of oxygen (O) = (mass of O / molar mass of CuCO3) × 100\n= (48.00 / 123.56) × 100 = 38.83%\n\n3. The percentage composition of copper carbonate (CuCO3) is:\nCopper (Cu): 51.45%\nCarbon (C): 9.72%\nOxygen (O): 38.83%\n\nPlease note that these percentages are theoretical values for pure copper carbonate. To determine the exact composition of the sample obtained from the mine, you would need to perform an elemental analysis using techniques such as mass spectrometry or X-ray fluorescence. These experimental methods will provide you with the actual percentage composition of the sample, which may differ from the theoretical values due to impurities or other minerals present in the sample."
