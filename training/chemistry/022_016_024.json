    "message_2": "To calculate the change in enthalpy (ΔH) for the combustion of 10 grams of propane, we first need to determine the number of moles of propane involved in the reaction. The molecular weight of propane (C3H8) is:\n\n(3 * 12.01 g/mol for C) + (8 * 1.01 g/mol for H) = 36.03 + 8.08 = 44.11 g/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of moles of propane:\n\n10 g / 44.11 g/mol = 0.2266 moles of propane\n\nThe heat released by the reaction is given as -2202 kJ. Since the heat released is negative, this indicates that the reaction is exothermic. To find the change in enthalpy (ΔH) per mole of propane, we can divide the total heat released by the number of moles of propane:\n\nΔH = -2202 kJ / 0.2266 moles = -9717.5 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the change in enthalpy (ΔH) for the combustion of 10 grams of propane is approximately -9717.5 kJ/mol."
