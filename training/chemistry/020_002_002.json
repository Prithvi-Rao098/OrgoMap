    "message_1": "Consider the chemical reaction A(g) + B(g) ↔ 2C(g). At equilibrium, the concentration of A is 0.25 M, the concentration of B is 0.15 M, and the concentration of C is 0.40 M. What is the equilibrium constant for this reaction at the given temperature?",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction, we can use the expression:\n\nKc = [C]^2 / ([A] * [B])\n\nAt equilibrium, the concentrations are given as [A] = 0.25 M, [B] = 0.15 M, and [C] = 0.40 M. Plugging these values into the expression, we get:\n\nKc = (0.40)^2 / (0.25 * 0.15)\n\nKc = 0.16 / 0.0375\n\nKc ≈ 4.27\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant for this reaction at the given temperature is approximately 4.27."
