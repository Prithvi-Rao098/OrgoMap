    "message_2": "To find the standard enthalpy of formation of MgO, we can use Hess's law to manipulate the given reactions and their enthalpies to get the desired reaction: Mg(s) + 1/2 O2(g) → MgO(s).\n\nFirst, we need to manipulate the given reactions:\n\n1. Divide the first reaction by 2 to get the formation of 1 mol of MgO:\nMg(s) + 1/2 O2(g) → MgO(s)   ΔH° = -1203 kJ / 2 = -601.5 kJ\n\n2. Divide the second reaction by 2 to get the formation of 1 mol of MgO:\nMg(s) + 1/2 CO2(g) → MgO(s) + 1/2 C(s)    ΔH° = -2619 kJ / 2 = -1309.5 kJ\n\nNow, we can add the third reaction and the modified second reaction:\n\nC(s) + O2(g) → CO2(g)    ΔH° = -393.5 kJ\nMg(s) + 1/2 CO2(g) → MgO(s) + 1/2 C(s)    ΔH° = -1309.5 kJ\n\nBy adding these two reactions, we get:\n\nMg(s) + O2(g) → MgO(s) + CO2(g)    ΔH° = -393.5 kJ + (-1309.5 kJ) = -1703 kJ\n\nNow, we can subtract the modified first reaction from this new reaction:\n\nMg(s) + O2(g) → MgO(s) + CO2(g)    ΔH° = -1703 kJ\n- [Mg(s) + 1/2 O2(g) → MgO(s)   ΔH° = -601.5 kJ]\n\nThis gives us the desired reaction:\n\n1/2 CO2(g) → 1/2 C(s) + 1/2 O2(g)    ΔH° = -1703 kJ + 601.5 kJ = -1101.5 kJ\n\nSince we want the standard enthalpy of formation of MgO, which is the reaction Mg(s) + 1/2 O2(g) → MgO(s), we can use the enthalpy value we found for the modified first reaction:\n\nMg(s) + 1/2 O2(g) → MgO(s)   ΔH° = -601.5 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation of MgO is -601.5 kJ/mol."
