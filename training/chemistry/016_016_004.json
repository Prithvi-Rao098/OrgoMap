Given the enthalpy of formation values for FeO (-272.3 kJ/mol) and CO (-110.5 kJ/mol), calculate the enthalpy of reduction reaction for FeO using the following equation: FeO(s) + CO(g) → Fe(s) + CO2(g)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the given reaction, we can use the formula:\n\nΔH_reaction = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nFirst, we need to find the enthalpy of formation for CO2. The enthalpy of formation for CO2 is -393.5 kJ/mol.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nΔH_reaction = [1 mol Fe × 0 kJ/mol (since it's an element in its standard state) + 1 mol CO2 × (-393.5 kJ/mol)] - [1 mol FeO × (-272.3 kJ/mol) + 1 mol CO × (-110.5 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH_reaction = [0 + (-393.5)] - [(-272.3) + (-110.5)]\n\nΔH_reaction = -393.5 - (-382.8)\n\nΔH_reaction = -10.7 kJ/mol\n\nSince we are considering 2 moles of FeO, we need to multiply the enthalpy change by 2:\n\nΔH_reaction (2 moles FeO) = -10.7 kJ/mol × 2 = -21.4 kJ\n\nSo, the enthalpy change when 2 moles of iron oxide (FeO) are reduced using carbon monoxide (CO) gas is -21.4 kJ."
