    "message_2": "The inorganic compound formed between magnesium and sulfur is an ionic compound. The chemical formula MgS represents magnesium sulfide, where magnesium (Mg) is a metal and sulfur (S) is a non-metal. In this compound, magnesium loses two electrons to form a +2 cation (Mg²⁺), while sulfur gains two electrons to form a -2 anion (S²⁻). The electrostatic attraction between these oppositely charged ions results in the formation of the ionic compound magnesium sulfide."
