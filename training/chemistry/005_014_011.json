    "message_2": "In a human red blood cell, one round of glycolysis produces a net gain of 2 ATP molecules. The overall chemical reaction equation for glycolysis is:\n\nC6H12O6 (glucose) + 2 NAD+ + 2 ADP + 2 Pi â†’ 2 C3H4O3 (pyruvate) + 2 NADH + 2 H+ + 2 ATP + 2 H2O\n\nHere, NAD+ is nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form), NADH is nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced form), ADP is adenosine diphosphate, Pi is inorganic phosphate, and H2O is water."
