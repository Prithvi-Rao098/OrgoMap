    "message_2": "As a chemist, I can provide you with a general approach to solving this problem, but I would need specific data from the gas chromatography (GC) analysis to give you the exact relative percentage composition of the mixture.\n\nHere's the general approach to solving this problem:\n\n1. Perform the gas chromatography analysis: Inject a known volume of the mixture into the GC instrument. The GC will separate the individual components (benzene, toluene, and xylene) based on their volatility and interaction with the stationary phase in the GC column.\n\n2. Obtain the chromatogram: The GC will produce a chromatogram, which is a graphical representation of the detector response as a function of time. Each component in the mixture will appear as a peak in the chromatogram, with the area under the peak being proportional to the concentration of the component in the mixture.\n\n3. Identify the peaks: Identify the peaks corresponding to benzene, toluene, and xylene in the chromatogram. This can be done by comparing the retention times of the peaks to those of known standards or by using a mass spectrometer as a detector.\n\n4. Calculate the peak areas: Integrate the area under each peak in the chromatogram. This can be done using software provided by the GC instrument manufacturer or by manual integration.\n\n5. Calculate the relative percentage composition: Divide the area of each peak by the total area of all three peaks and multiply by 100 to obtain the relative percentage composition of each component in the mixture.\n\nRelative percentage composition of benzene = (Area of benzene peak / Total area of all peaks) x 100\nRelative percentage composition of toluene = (Area of toluene peak / Total area of all peaks) x 100\nRelative percentage composition of xylene = (Area of xylene peak / Total area of all peaks) x 100\n\nPlease note that without the specific data from the GC analysis, I cannot provide the exact relative percentage composition of the mixture."
