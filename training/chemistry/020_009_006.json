    "message_1": "Dinitrogen tetroxide converts into nitrogen dioxide according to the following equation N2O4(g) â‡‹ 2NO2(g). At equilibrium, the concentration of N2O4 is found to be 0.02 M and the concentration of NO2 is found to be 0.08 M. Calculate the equilibrium constant (Kc) for this reaction.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction, we can use the expression:\n\nKc = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4]\n\nAt equilibrium, the concentration of N2O4 is 0.02 M and the concentration of NO2 is 0.08 M. Plugging these values into the expression, we get:\n\nKc = (0.08)^2 / (0.02)\n\nKc = 0.0064 / 0.02\n\nKc = 0.32\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for this reaction is 0.32."
