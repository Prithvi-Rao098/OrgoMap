    "message_2": "To determine the standard enthalpy of formation of ethanol (C2H5OH), we can use the information given and Hess's Law. The balanced combustion reaction for ethanol is:\n\nC2H5OH(l) + 3O2(g) → 2CO2(g) + 3H2O(l)\n\nWe are given the following information:\n1. The combustion of 1 mole of ethanol yields 1367 kJ of heat.\n2. The standard enthalpy of formation for CO2(g) is -393.5 kJ/mol.\n3. The standard enthalpy of formation for H2O(l) is -285.8 kJ/mol.\n\nUsing Hess's Law, we can write the enthalpy change for the combustion reaction as:\n\nΔH_combustion = [2ΔHf(CO2) + 3ΔHf(H2O)] - ΔHf(C2H5OH)\n\nWe know that ΔH_combustion = -1367 kJ/mol, so we can plug in the values and solve for ΔHf(C2H5OH):\n\n-1367 kJ/mol = [2(-393.5 kJ/mol) + 3(-285.8 kJ/mol)] - ΔHf(C2H5OH)\n\n-1367 kJ/mol = (-787 kJ/mol - 857.4 kJ/mol) - ΔHf(C2H5OH)\n\nNow, we can solve for ΔHf(C2H5OH):\n\nΔHf(C2H5OH) = -787 kJ/mol - 857.4 kJ/mol + 1367 kJ/mol\n\nΔHf(C2H5OH) = -277.4 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy of formation of ethanol (C2H5OH) is -277.4 kJ/mol."
