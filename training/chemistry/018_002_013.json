    "message_2": "For a first-order reaction, the rate law is given by:\n\nRate = k[A]\n\nwhere Rate is the rate of the reaction, k is the rate constant, and [A] is the concentration of the reactant (in this case, hydrogen peroxide).\n\nWe are given the rate of decomposition (Rate) as 0.050 mol/L·s and the concentration of hydrogen peroxide ([A]) as 2.00 mol/L. We need to find the rate constant (k).\n\nPlugging the given values into the rate law equation:\n\n0.050 mol/L·s = k(2.00 mol/L)\n\nNow, we can solve for k:\n\nk = (0.050 mol/L·s) / (2.00 mol/L) = 0.025 s^(-1)\n\nThe rate constant for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide at 25°C is 0.025 s^(-1)."
