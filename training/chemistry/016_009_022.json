    "message_2": "To find the enthalpy of vaporization of water, we can use the formula:\n\nEnthalpy of vaporization (ΔHvap) = Heat absorbed (q) / Mass of water (m)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the heat absorbed from kJ to J:\n\n167.7 kJ * 1000 J/kJ = 167700 J\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nΔHvap = 167700 J / 45 g\n\nΔHvap ≈ 3726.67 J/g\n\nThe enthalpy of vaporization of water is approximately 3726.67 J/g."
