    "message_2": "Infrared (IR) spectroscopy and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy are two powerful techniques used to determine the structure of an unknown organic compound. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use these techniques together:\n\n1. Obtain the IR spectrum of the unknown compound:\n   - Run an IR spectroscopy experiment on the unknown compound to obtain its IR spectrum. This will provide information about the functional groups present in the molecule.\n\n2. Analyze the IR spectrum:\n   - Look for characteristic absorption bands in the IR spectrum that correspond to specific functional groups (e.g., carbonyl, hydroxyl, amine, etc.). This will help you identify the functional groups present in the unknown compound.\n   - Note that some functional groups may have overlapping absorption bands, so it's essential to consider the entire spectrum when making conclusions.\n\n3. Obtain the 1H NMR spectrum of the unknown compound:\n   - Run a 1H NMR spectroscopy experiment on the unknown compound to obtain its proton NMR spectrum. This will provide information about the hydrogen atoms in the molecule, their chemical environment, and their connectivity.\n\n4. Analyze the 1H NMR spectrum:\n   - Determine the number of unique proton environments in the molecule by counting the number of distinct peaks or multiplets in the spectrum.\n   - Calculate the integration of each peak or multiplet to determine the relative number of protons in each environment.\n   - Analyze the chemical shifts of the peaks or multiplets to gain insight into the type of functional groups and the electronic environment of the protons.\n   - Examine the splitting patterns (multiplicity) of the peaks or multiplets to determine the coupling between neighboring protons and infer the connectivity of the hydrogen atoms in the molecule.\n\n5. Combine the information from IR and 1H NMR spectroscopy:\n   - Use the functional group information obtained from the IR spectrum and the detailed structural information from the 1H NMR spectrum to propose a possible structure for the unknown compound.\n   - Compare the proposed structure with known reference data (e.g., literature values, spectral databases) to confirm the structure or make adjustments as needed.\n\n6. Additional techniques (if necessary):\n   - If the information from IR and 1H NMR spectroscopy is not sufficient to determine the structure of the unknown compound, other techniques such as 13C NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, or X-ray crystallography may be employed to provide further structural information.\n\nBy following these steps and carefully analyzing the data obtained from both IR and 1H NMR spectroscopy, you can determine the structure of an unknown organic compound with confidence."
