    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise problem for the student to solve:\n\nWhat is the power output of a battery with a cell potential of 1.5 volts and a current of 2 amperes? The battery has a total of 6 cells arranged in series, and each cell has an internal resistance of 0.5 ohms. Assume that the battery operates under constant load until fully discharged. Determine the power output of the battery in watts.",
    "message_2": "To determine the power output of the battery, we first need to find the total voltage and total resistance of the battery.\n\nSince there are 6 cells arranged in series, the total voltage (V_total) is the sum of the voltages of each cell:\n\nV_total = 1.5 V/cell * 6 cells = 9 V\n\nNext, we need to find the total resistance (R_total) of the battery, which is the sum of the internal resistances of each cell:\n\nR_total = 0.5 ohms/cell * 6 cells = 3 ohms\n\nNow, we can use Ohm's Law to find the voltage drop (V_drop) across the internal resistance:\n\nV_drop = I * R_total\nV_drop = 2 A * 3 ohms = 6 V\n\nThe voltage across the load (V_load) is the difference between the total voltage and the voltage drop:\n\nV_load = V_total - V_drop = 9 V - 6 V = 3 V\n\nFinally, we can calculate the power output (P) of the battery using the formula:\n\nP = I * V_load\nP = 2 A * 3 V = 6 W\n\nSo, the power output of the battery is 6 watts."
