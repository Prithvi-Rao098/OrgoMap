    "message_2": "The enthalpy of ionization, also known as ionization energy, is the energy required to remove an electron from a gaseous atom or ion. In this case, we are given the energy required to remove one electron from a gaseous magnesium atom, which is 576 kJ/mol.\n\nThe enthalpy of ionization of magnesium (Mg) can be represented as:\n\nMg(g) → Mg⁺(g) + e⁻\n\nThe ionization energy for this process is given as 576 kJ/mol. Therefore, the enthalpy of ionization of magnesium is 576 kJ/mol."
