    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction, we first need to determine the equilibrium concentrations of all species involved in the reaction.\n\nGiven:\nInitial concentration of NO2(g) = 0.2 M\nEquilibrium concentration of NO(g) = 0.1 M\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is 2NO2(g) ⇌ 2NO(g) + O2(g), we can determine the changes in concentration for each species at equilibrium:\n\nChange in NO2(g) concentration = -2x\nChange in NO(g) concentration = +2x\nChange in O2(g) concentration = +x\n\nWe know that the equilibrium concentration of NO(g) is 0.1 M, so:\n\n0.2 - 2x = 0.1 - x\nx = 0.1 M\n\nNow, we can find the equilibrium concentrations of all species:\n\n[NO2] = 0.2 - 2(0.1) = 0.0 M\n[NO] = 0.1 M\n[O2] = 0.1 M\n\nNow, we can calculate the equilibrium constant (Kc) using the expression:\n\nKc = [NO]^2 * [O2] / [NO2]^2\n\nSince the concentration of NO2 is 0, the reaction has gone to completion, and Kc is undefined in this case. This means that the reaction has shifted completely to the right, favoring the formation of NO and O2."
