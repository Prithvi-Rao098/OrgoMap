    "message_1": "The problem for the chemistry student to solve is: What is the corrosion rate of iron (Fe) in a sea environment if it loses 5 grams of mass during one month?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the corrosion rate of iron (Fe) in a sea environment, we can use the following formula:\n\nCorrosion rate (CR) = (Weight loss (WL) × Equivalent weight (EW) × K) / (Area (A) × Time (T))\n\nWhere:\n- Weight loss (WL) is the mass loss of the iron due to corrosion (5 grams in this case)\n- Equivalent weight (EW) is the atomic weight of iron divided by the number of electrons lost during the corrosion process (for iron, the atomic weight is 55.85 g/mol and it typically loses 2 electrons during corrosion, so EW = 55.85/2 = 27.925 g/equivalent)\n- K is a constant to convert the units (for the corrosion rate in mm/year, K = 3.27 × 10^6 mm^3/(g·year·m^2))\n- Area (A) is the surface area of the iron exposed to the sea environment (we need this value to proceed)\n- Time (T) is the duration of the exposure (1 month, which is approximately 1/12 of a year or 0.0833 years)\n\nTo solve the problem, we need the surface area (A) of the iron exposed to the sea environment. If you provide this value, we can calculate the corrosion rate."
