    "message_2": "To balance the chemical equation for the oxidation of ethanol to acetic acid using potassium dichromate as the oxidizing agent in acidic medium, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Write the unbalanced equation:\nC2H5OH + K2Cr2O7 → CH3COOH\n\n2. Balance the atoms other than hydrogen and oxygen:\nC2H5OH + K2Cr2O7 → 2CH3COOH\n\n3. Balance the oxygen atoms by adding water molecules:\nC2H5OH + K2Cr2O7 → 2CH3COOH + H2O\n\n4. Balance the hydrogen atoms by adding protons (H+):\nC2H5OH + K2Cr2O7 + 4H+ → 2CH3COOH + H2O\n\n5. Balance the charge by adding electrons (e-):\nC2H5OH + K2Cr2O7 + 4H+ + 6e- → 2CH3COOH + H2O\n\n6. Balance the chromium atoms by adding Cr3+ ions:\nC2H5OH + K2Cr2O7 + 4H+ + 6e- → 2CH3COOH + H2O + 2Cr3+\n\nNow the balanced chemical equation is:\nC2H5OH + K2Cr2O7 + 4H+ + 6e- → 2CH3COOH + H2O + 2Cr3+"
