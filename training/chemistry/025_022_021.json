    "message_2": "To balance the chemical equation Fe + HCl -> FeCl3 + H2, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of atoms for each element on both sides of the equation.\n   Reactants: 1 Fe, 1 H, 1 Cl\n   Products: 1 Fe, 2 H, 3 Cl\n\n2. Balance the elements one by one, starting with the element that appears the least number of times in the equation. In this case, we'll start with Cl (chlorine).\n\n3. There are 3 Cl atoms in FeCl3 on the product side, but only 1 Cl atom in HCl on the reactant side. To balance the Cl atoms, we need to multiply HCl by 3:\n\n   Fe + 3HCl -> FeCl3 + H2\n\n   Now, the Cl atoms are balanced:\n   Reactants: 1 Fe, 3 H, 3 Cl\n   Products: 1 Fe, 2 H, 3 Cl\n\n4. Next, balance the H (hydrogen) atoms. There are 3 H atoms on the reactant side and 2 H atoms on the product side. To balance the H atoms, we need to find the lowest common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 2, which is 6. Multiply both HCl and H2 by the appropriate coefficients to get 6 H atoms on both sides:\n\n   Fe + 6HCl -> 2FeCl3 + 3H2\n\n   Now, the H atoms are balanced:\n   Reactants: 1 Fe, 6 H, 6 Cl\n   Products: 2 Fe, 6 H, 6 Cl\n\n5. Finally, balance the Fe (iron) atoms. There are 2 Fe atoms on the product side but only 1 Fe atom on the reactant side. To balance the Fe atoms, multiply Fe by 2:\n\n   2Fe + 6HCl -> 2FeCl3 + 3H2\n\n   Now, all the elements are balanced:\n   Reactants: 2 Fe, 6 H, 6 Cl\n   Products: 2 Fe, 6 H, 6 Cl\n\nThe balanced chemical equation is:\n\n2Fe + 6HCl -> 2FeCl3 + 3H2"
