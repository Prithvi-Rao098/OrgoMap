    "message_1": "What is the efficiency of an electrochemical cell with a standard potential difference of 1.2 V and an actual potential difference of 1.1 V at 25Â°C? If the total energy supplied to the cell is 200 J, how much useful work can be obtained from the cell and what is the amount of heat released?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the efficiency of the electrochemical cell, we can use the following formula:\n\nEfficiency = (Actual potential difference / Standard potential difference) * 100\n\nEfficiency = (1.1 V / 1.2 V) * 100\nEfficiency = 0.9167 * 100\nEfficiency = 91.67 %\n\nNow, we need to find the useful work obtained from the cell. Since the efficiency is 91.67%, we can calculate the useful work as follows:\n\nUseful work = Total energy supplied * Efficiency\nUseful work = 200 J * 0.9167\nUseful work = 183.34 J\n\nFinally, we need to find the amount of heat released. This can be calculated by subtracting the useful work from the total energy supplied:\n\nHeat released = Total energy supplied - Useful work\nHeat released = 200 J - 183.34 J\nHeat released = 16.66 J\n\nSo, the efficiency of the electrochemical cell is 91.67%, the useful work obtained from the cell is 183.34 J, and the amount of heat released is 16.66 J."
