    "message_2": "The oxidation state of the sulfur atom in H2SO4 can be determined by assigning oxidation states to each atom in the compound and then solving for the sulfur atom's oxidation state.\n\n1. Hydrogen has an oxidation state of +1.\n2. Oxygen has an oxidation state of -2.\n\nThe overall charge of the compound is 0. So, we can set up an equation:\n\n2(+1) + 1(S) + 4(-2) = 0\n\nSolving for S (sulfur's oxidation state):\n\n2 + S - 8 = 0\nS - 6 = 0\nS = +6\n\nThe oxidation state of the sulfur atom in H2SO4 is +6."
