    "message_2": "To calculate the heat of formation (ΔHf) of methane (CH4), we need to consider the bond energies of the reactants and products. In this case, we are given the bond energies for C-C and C-H bonds. However, we also need the bond energies for the C=O and O=O bonds, as they are involved in the formation of methane from its elements (carbon and hydrogen). The bond energies for C=O and O=O are approximately 799 kJ/mol and 498 kJ/mol, respectively.\n\nThe formation of methane can be represented by the following chemical equation:\n\nC (graphite) + 2 H2 (g) → CH4 (g)\n\nNow, we can calculate the ΔHf using the bond energies:\n\nΔHf = Σ (bond energies of reactants) - Σ (bond energies of products)\n\nFor the reactants, we have one C=O bond and two O=O bonds:\n\nΣ (bond energies of reactants) = 1 * 799 kJ/mol + 2 * 498 kJ/mol = 1795 kJ/mol\n\nFor the products, we have four C-H bonds:\n\nΣ (bond energies of products) = 4 * 413 kJ/mol = 1652 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the ΔHf:\n\nΔHf = 1795 kJ/mol - 1652 kJ/mol = 143 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the heat of formation (ΔHf) of methane (CH4) is approximately 143 kJ/mol."
