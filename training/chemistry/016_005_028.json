    "message_2": "To find the enthalpy of combustion of ethanol, we first need to calculate the heat released during the combustion process. We can do this using the formula:\n\nq = C * ΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat released, C is the heat capacity of the calorimeter, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nGiven the heat capacity of the calorimeter (C) is 45.8 kJ/°C and the temperature increase (ΔT) is 23.8 °C, we can calculate the heat released (q):\n\nq = 45.8 kJ/°C * 23.8 °C = 1090.04 kJ\n\nNow, we need to find the moles of ethanol burned. The molecular weight of ethanol (C2H5OH) is:\n\n(2 * 12.01) + (6 * 1.01) + (1 * 16.00) = 24.02 + 6.06 + 16.00 = 46.08 g/mol\n\nGiven that 100 g of ethanol were burned, we can calculate the moles of ethanol:\n\nmoles = mass / molecular weight = 100 g / 46.08 g/mol = 2.17 mol\n\nFinally, we can find the enthalpy of combustion per mole of ethanol by dividing the heat released by the moles of ethanol:\n\nenthalpy of combustion = q / moles = 1090.04 kJ / 2.17 mol = 502.07 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the enthalpy of combustion of ethanol is approximately 502.07 kJ/mol."
