    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log ([A-]/[HA])\n\nwhere pH is the solution's pH, pKa is the acid dissociation constant, [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base, and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid.\n\nFor acetic acid, the pKa is approximately 4.74. Let's assume that the initial concentrations of acetic acid (HA) and sodium acetate (A-) are equal, which means the initial pH of the solution is also 4.74.\n\nNow, we will add a buffer solution with a pH of 7.4. The buffer will resist changes in pH, but we need to calculate the new pH and the percentage change in the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+).\n\nFirst, let's find the new concentrations of acetic acid and sodium acetate after adding the buffer. Since the buffer has a pH of 7.4, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the new ratio of [A-]/[HA]:\n\n7.4 = 4.74 + log ([A-]/[HA])\n\n2.66 = log ([A-]/[HA])\n\n10^2.66 = [A-]/[HA]\n\nNow, let's add 0.1 mole of hydrochloric acid (HCl) to the system. HCl is a strong acid and will react with sodium acetate (A-) to form acetic acid (HA) and chloride ions (Cl-):\n\nHCl + NaCH3COO â†’ CH3COOH + NaCl\n\n0.1 mole of HCl will react with 0.1 mole of sodium acetate, so the new concentrations of acetic acid and sodium acetate will be:\n\n[HA]new = [HA] + 0.1\n[A-]new = [A-] - 0.1\n\nNow, we can use the new concentrations to find the new pH:\n\npHnew = 4.74 + log (([A-] - 0.1)/([HA] + 0.1))\n\nTo find the percentage change in the concentration of hydrogen ions, we need to calculate the initial and final concentrations of H+ ions:\n\n[H+]initial = 10^(-pHinitial) = 10^(-4.74)\n[H+]final = 10^(-pHnew)\n\nPercentage change in [H+] = (([H+]final - [H+]initial) / [H+]initial) * 100\n\nWithout the exact initial concentrations of acetic acid and sodium acetate, we cannot provide a numerical answer for the change in pH and the percentage change in the concentration of hydrogen ions. However, the steps and equations provided above can be used to solve the problem once the initial concentrations are known."
