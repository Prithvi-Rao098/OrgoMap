    "message_2": "To calculate the formal charge on the central atom (Sulfur) in the compound SO$_3$, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Determine the number of valence electrons for the central atom (Sulfur).\nSulfur is in group 16 (or 6A) of the periodic table, so it has 6 valence electrons.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of bonding electrons.\nIn SO$_3$, there are three S-O bonds. Each bond consists of 2 electrons, so there are a total of 3 x 2 = 6 bonding electrons.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the number of non-bonding electrons.\nSince Sulfur has 6 valence electrons and all of them are used in bonding, there are 0 non-bonding electrons.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the formal charge.\nFormal charge = (valence electrons) - (1/2 x bonding electrons) - (non-bonding electrons)\nFormal charge = 6 - (1/2 x 6) - 0\nFormal charge = 6 - 3\nFormal charge = 3\n\nTherefore, the formal charge on the central atom (Sulfur) in the compound SO$_3$ is +3."
