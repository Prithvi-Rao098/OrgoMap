    "message_2": "To determine the empirical formula and molar mass of the compound, we first need to convert the given percentages into grams and then into moles.\n\n1. Convert percentages to grams:\nCarbon: 66.7% of 90.0 g = (66.7/100) * 90.0 g = 60.03 g\nHydrogen: 11.1% of 90.0 g = (11.1/100) * 90.0 g = 9.99 g\nOxygen: 22.2% of 90.0 g = (22.2/100) * 90.0 g = 19.98 g\n\n2. Convert grams to moles:\nCarbon: 60.03 g / 12.01 g/mol (molar mass of C) = 5.00 mol\nHydrogen: 9.99 g / 1.01 g/mol (molar mass of H) = 9.89 mol\nOxygen: 19.98 g / 16.00 g/mol (molar mass of O) = 1.25 mol\n\n3. Divide each value by the smallest number of moles to get the mole ratio:\nCarbon: 5.00 mol / 1.25 mol = 4\nHydrogen: 9.89 mol / 1.25 mol â‰ˆ 8\nOxygen: 1.25 mol / 1.25 mol = 1\n\n4. The empirical formula is C4H8O1, which can be written as C4H8O.\n\n5. Calculate the molar mass of the empirical formula:\nMolar mass = (4 * 12.01 g/mol) + (8 * 1.01 g/mol) + (1 * 16.00 g/mol) = 48.04 g/mol + 8.08 g/mol + 16.00 g/mol = 72.12 g/mol\n\nThe molar mass of the compound is 72.12 g/mol, and the empirical formula is C4H8O."
