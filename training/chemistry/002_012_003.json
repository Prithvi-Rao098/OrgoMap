    "message_2": "To determine the bond order and bond length of the nitrogen-oxygen bond in the nitrate ion (NO3-) using molecular orbital theory, we need to first analyze the molecular orbitals of the ion.\n\nThe nitrate ion (NO3-) has a total of 18 valence electrons. The molecular orbitals can be constructed by combining the atomic orbitals of nitrogen and oxygen. The central nitrogen atom contributes 5 valence electrons, and each oxygen atom contributes 6 valence electrons. The extra electron comes from the negative charge of the ion.\n\nThe molecular orbitals of NO3- can be represented as follows:\n\n1. σ(N2s) - 2 electrons\n2. σ*(N2s) - 0 electrons\n3. σ(N2p) - 2 electrons\n4. π(N2p) - 4 electrons (2 electrons in each of the two degenerate orbitals)\n5. π*(N2p) - 6 electrons (3 electrons in each of the two degenerate orbitals)\n6. σ*(N2p) - 4 electrons\n\nNow, we can calculate the bond order using the formula:\n\nBond order = (number of electrons in bonding orbitals - number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\n\nBond order = (2 + 2 + 4 - 6 - 4) / 2\nBond order = (-2) / 2\nBond order = -1\n\nHowever, this result is not accurate because the nitrate ion is a resonance structure. In reality, the negative charge and the extra electron are delocalized over the three oxygen atoms. Therefore, the bond order should be divided by the number of resonance structures (3 in this case) to get the actual bond order.\n\nActual bond order = -1 / 3 ≈ -0.33\n\nSince the bond order is negative, it indicates that there is no stable bond between nitrogen and oxygen in the nitrate ion. However, this is not the case in reality. The negative bond order obtained here is an artifact of the molecular orbital theory, which does not accurately describe the bonding in the nitrate ion.\n\nIn reality, the bond order in the nitrate ion is approximately 1.33 (4/3), as there are three equivalent N-O bonds formed by resonance. The bond length of the N-O bond in the nitrate ion is experimentally determined to be around 1.26 Å."
