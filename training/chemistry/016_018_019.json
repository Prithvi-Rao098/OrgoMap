The specific heat of the solution is 4.18 J/g °C and the density of the solution is 1.00 g/mL.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the ionization of sodium chloride, we can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat absorbed or released, m is the mass of the solution, c is the specific heat of the solution, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nFirst, let's find the mass of the solution. Since the density of the solution is 1.00 g/mL, the mass of the solution is:\n\nmass of solution = mass of water + mass of NaCl\nmass of solution = 100.0 g + 5.00 g = 105.0 g\n\nNext, we can find the change in temperature:\n\nΔT = T_final - T_initial\nΔT = 27.5°C - 25.0°C = 2.5°C\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat absorbed or released (q) using the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\nq = (105.0 g)(4.18 J/g °C)(2.5°C)\nq = 1098.95 J\n\nSince the temperature of the solution increased, the enthalpy change is negative (exothermic reaction). Therefore, the enthalpy change for the ionization of sodium chloride is -1098.95 J."
