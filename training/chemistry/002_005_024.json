    "message_2": "1. NaCl (Sodium Chloride) - Ionic: It is formed by the transfer of electrons between a metal (sodium) and a non-metal (chlorine).\n\n2. H2O (Water) - Covalent: It is formed by the sharing of electrons between two non-metals (hydrogen and oxygen).\n\n3. Fe (Iron) - Metallic: It is a pure metal, and metallic bonds are present between the metal atoms.\n\n4. CO2 (Carbon Dioxide) - Covalent: It is formed by the sharing of electrons between a non-metal (carbon) and another non-metal (oxygen).\n\n5. MgO (Magnesium Oxide) - Ionic: It is formed by the transfer of electrons between a metal (magnesium) and a non-metal (oxygen)."
