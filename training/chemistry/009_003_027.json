    "message_1": "What is the energy released when one atom of uranium-235 undergoes complete fission? How does this compare to the amount of energy released from the combustion of one kilogram of coal?",
    "message_2": "When one atom of uranium-235 undergoes complete fission, it releases approximately 200 MeV (million electron volts) of energy. To convert this to joules, we can use the conversion factor 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^(-19) J. \n\nEnergy released per fission = 200 MeV x (1.602 x 10^(-19) J/eV) = 3.204 x 10^(-11) J\n\nNow let's compare this to the energy released from the combustion of one kilogram of coal. The energy content of coal can vary, but on average, it is around 24 MJ/kg (megajoules per kilogram).\n\nEnergy released from 1 kg of coal = 24 MJ = 24 x 10^6 J\n\nTo compare the energy released from uranium-235 fission to coal combustion, we need to determine how many uranium-235 atoms would be in one kilogram.\n\nThe atomic mass of uranium-235 is approximately 235 g/mol. Therefore, 1 kg of uranium-235 contains:\n\n(1000 g) / (235 g/mol) = 4.255 mol of uranium-235\n\nSince 1 mol contains Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23) of atoms:\n\n4.255 mol x (6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol) = 2.56 x 10^24 atoms of uranium-235\n\nNow we can calculate the total energy released from 1 kg of uranium-235 undergoing fission:\n\n(2.56 x 10^24 atoms) x (3.204 x 10^(-11) J/atom) = 8.2 x 10^13 J\n\nFinally, we can compare the energy released from uranium-235 fission to coal combustion:\n\nEnergy ratio (U-235 fission / coal combustion) = (8.2 x 10^13 J) / (24 x 10^6 J) = 3.42 x 10^6\n\nThis means that the energy released from the fission of one kilogram of uranium-235 is approximately 3.42 million times greater than the energy released from the combustion of one kilogram of coal."
