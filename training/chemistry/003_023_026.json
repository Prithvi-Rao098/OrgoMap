Assume that all reactants and products are in the gas phase and that the temperature of the reactants is 25°C.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the change in enthalpy (∆H) for the combustion of 1 mole of methane gas (CH4), we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the combustion reaction:\n\nCH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(g)\n\nNext, we need to find the standard heats of formation (∆Hf) for all the reactants and products involved in the reaction. We are given the ∆Hf for methane (CH4) as -74.81 kJ/mol. We also need the ∆Hf values for O2, CO2, and H2O. The standard heat of formation for O2 is 0 kJ/mol since it is an element in its standard state. The standard heats of formation for CO2(g) and H2O(g) are -393.51 kJ/mol and -241.82 kJ/mol, respectively.\n\nNow we can use Hess's Law to calculate the change in enthalpy (∆H) for the reaction:\n\n∆H = [∆Hf(products) - ∆Hf(reactants)]\n\n∆H = [(1 mol × -393.51 kJ/mol) + (2 mol × -241.82 kJ/mol)] - [(1 mol × -74.81 kJ/mol) + (2 mol × 0 kJ/mol)]\n\n∆H = (-393.51 kJ + (-483.64 kJ)) - (-74.81 kJ)\n\n∆H = (-877.15 kJ) + 74.81 kJ\n\n∆H = -802.34 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the change in enthalpy (∆H) for the combustion of 1 mole of methane gas (CH4) at constant pressure is -802.34 kJ/mol."
