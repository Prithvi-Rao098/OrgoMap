    "message_2": "The structure of proteins plays a crucial role in determining their function in living organisms. Proteins are made up of amino acids, which are joined together by peptide bonds to form long chains called polypeptides. The sequence of amino acids in a protein determines its unique structure and function. There are four levels of protein structure: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary.\n\n1. Primary structure: This is the linear sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide chain. The primary structure determines the overall structure and function of the protein, as different amino acids have different properties (e.g., hydrophobic, hydrophilic, acidic, or basic).\n\n2. Secondary structure: This refers to the local folding of the polypeptide chain into regular structures, such as alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which are stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the backbone atoms of the amino acids.\n\n3. Tertiary structure: This is the overall three-dimensional folding of the polypeptide chain, which is stabilized by various interactions, including hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and disulfide bridges. The tertiary structure is crucial for the protein's function, as it determines the shape and arrangement of the protein's active site and other functional regions.\n\n4. Quaternary structure: Some proteins are composed of multiple polypeptide chains, called subunits, which interact to form a functional protein complex. The quaternary structure refers to the arrangement and interaction of these subunits.\n\nEnzymes are proteins that act as biological catalysts, speeding up the rate of biochemical reactions in living organisms. They interact with biomolecules, such as substrates, to facilitate these reactions. The enzyme's active site is a specific region within its tertiary structure where the substrate binds, and the reaction takes place. The active site has a unique shape and chemical environment, which is complementary to the shape and properties of the substrate.\n\nEnzyme-substrate interactions follow the lock-and-key model or the induced fit model. In the lock-and-key model, the enzyme's active site and the substrate have complementary shapes, allowing the substrate to fit into the active site like a key into a lock. In the induced fit model, the enzyme's active site undergoes a conformational change upon substrate binding, resulting in a better fit and stronger interactions.\n\nEnzymes lower the activation energy of the reaction, making it easier for the reaction to proceed. They achieve this by stabilizing the transition state, the high-energy intermediate state between reactants and products. Once the reaction is complete, the products are released, and the enzyme returns to its original state, ready to catalyze another reaction.\n\nIn summary, the structure of proteins, particularly their tertiary structure, is crucial for their function, as it determines the shape and chemical environment of their active sites. Enzymes, as a type of protein, interact with biomolecules to facilitate biochemical reactions by binding to substrates, stabilizing the transition state, and lowering the activation energy required for the reaction to proceed."
