    "message_1": "What is the enthalpy of the reaction between 2 moles of hydrogen gas and 1 mole of oxygen gas to form 2 moles of water vapor, given that the standard enthalpy of formation of water is -286 kJ/mol? The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\n2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(g)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of the reaction, we can use the following formula:\n\nΔH_reaction = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nIn this case, the reactants are 2 moles of hydrogen gas (H2) and 1 mole of oxygen gas (O2). The product is 2 moles of water vapor (H2O). The standard enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) of water vapor is given as -286 kJ/mol.\n\nSince the standard enthalpy of formation for elements in their standard states (H2 and O2) is zero, we only need to consider the enthalpy of formation for the products:\n\nΔH_reaction = [2 moles × (-286 kJ/mol)] - [0]\n\nΔH_reaction = -572 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy of the reaction between 2 moles of hydrogen gas and 1 mole of oxygen gas to form 2 moles of water vapor is -572 kJ."
