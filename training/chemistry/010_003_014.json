    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change for the electrochemical reaction, we first need to determine the balanced overall redox reaction and the standard cell potential (E°cell) for the reaction.\n\nThe given half-reactions are:\n\nFe3+(aq) + e- ⇌ Fe2+(aq)              E° = 0.771 V\nBr2(l) + 2e- ⇌ 2Br-(aq)           E° = 1.087 V\n\nFirst, we need to balance the electrons in both half-reactions. Since the second reaction involves 2 electrons, we need to multiply the first reaction by 2 to balance the electrons:\n\n2(Fe3+(aq) + e- ⇌ Fe2+(aq))              2(E°) = 2(0.771 V)\n2Fe3+(aq) + 2e- ⇌ 2Fe2+(aq)              E° = 1.542 V\n\nNow, we can combine the two half-reactions:\n\n2Fe3+(aq) + 2e- + Br2(l) + 2e- ⇌ 2Fe2+(aq) + 2Br-(aq)\n\nThe electrons cancel out:\n\n2Fe3+(aq) + Br2(l) ⇌ 2Fe2+(aq) + 2Br-(aq)\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard cell potential (E°cell) by adding the standard potentials of the two half-reactions:\n\nE°cell = E°(reduction) + E°(oxidation)\nE°cell = 1.087 V + 1.542 V\nE°cell = 2.629 V\n\nFinally, we can calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) using the formula:\n\nΔG° = -nFE°cell\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of electrons transferred (in this case, 2), F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol), and E°cell is the standard cell potential.\n\nΔG° = -2 * 96,485 C/mol * 2.629 V\nΔG° = -507,726 J/mol\n\nSo, the Gibbs free energy change for the electrochemical reaction is -507,726 J/mol."
