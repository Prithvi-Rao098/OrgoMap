    "message_1": "What is the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of 1 mole of methane (CH4) to form carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) at constant pressure, if the enthalpies of formation for CH4, CO2 and H2O are -74.8 kJ/mol, -393.5 kJ/mol and -285.8 kJ/mol respectively?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of methane, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH_combustion = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane is:\n\nCH₄(g) + 2 O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2 H₂O(g)\n\nNow, we can plug in the enthalpies of formation for each compound:\n\nΔH_combustion = [1 × (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 × (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [1 × (-74.8 kJ/mol) + 2 × 0 kJ/mol]\n\nNote that the enthalpy of formation for O₂ is 0 kJ/mol since it is in its standard state.\n\nΔH_combustion = (-393.5 - 571.6) - (-74.8)\n\nΔH_combustion = -965.1 + 74.8\n\nΔH_combustion = -890.3 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of 1 mole of methane is -890.3 kJ/mol."
