    "message_2": "The enthalpy of formation of water (H2O) from its elements hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) at standard conditions (25°C and 1 atm) is approximately -285.8 kJ/mol. This value represents the energy released when one mole of water is formed from its constituent elements under standard conditions."
