    "message_1": "What is the efficiency of an electrochemical cell with an Ecell of 1.20 V when it is used to generate 2.0 moles of electricity by the oxidation of copper metal in one half-cell and the reduction of silver ions in the other half-cell? (Assume that the Faraday constant is 96,500 C/mol e-)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the efficiency of an electrochemical cell, we need to compare the actual cell potential (Ecell) to the theoretical cell potential (E°cell). The theoretical cell potential can be calculated using the standard reduction potentials of the two half-reactions.\n\nThe half-reactions are:\nCu(s) → Cu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ (oxidation)\nAg⁺(aq) + e⁻ → Ag(s) (reduction)\n\nThe standard reduction potentials are:\nE°(Cu²⁺/Cu) = +0.34 V\nE°(Ag⁺/Ag) = +0.80 V\n\nSince the copper half-reaction is an oxidation, we need to reverse its sign:\nE°(Cu/Cu²⁺) = -0.34 V\n\nNow, we can calculate the theoretical cell potential (E°cell):\nE°cell = E°(Ag⁺/Ag) - E°(Cu/Cu²⁺) = 0.80 V - (-0.34 V) = 1.14 V\n\nThe actual cell potential (Ecell) is given as 1.20 V. Now we can calculate the efficiency:\nEfficiency = (Ecell / E°cell) × 100%\n\nEfficiency = (1.20 V / 1.14 V) × 100% = 1.0526 × 100% ≈ 105.26%\n\nHowever, the efficiency of an electrochemical cell cannot be greater than 100%. This discrepancy may be due to an error in the given Ecell value or other factors affecting the cell potential. In practice, the efficiency of an electrochemical cell is usually less than 100% due to various losses such as internal resistance, side reactions, and mass transport limitations."
