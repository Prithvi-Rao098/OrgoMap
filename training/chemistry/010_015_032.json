    "message_1": "What is the overpotential required for the reduction of Ag+ to Ag in a half-cell containing a 0.1 M solution of AgNO₃ and a silver electrode at 25°C, given that the standard potential for the reduction of Ag+ to Ag is 0.80 V and the actual potential measured for the cell is 0.85 V?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the overpotential, we need to first determine the equilibrium potential (E) for the half-cell reaction using the Nernst equation:\n\nE = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\n\nWhere:\nE° = standard potential for the reduction of Ag+ to Ag (0.80 V)\nR = gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\nT = temperature (25°C = 298.15 K)\nn = number of electrons transferred in the reaction (1 for Ag+/Ag)\nF = Faraday's constant (96,485 C/mol)\nQ = reaction quotient, which is equal to [Ag+] for this half-cell reaction\n\nFirst, let's calculate the term (RT/nF):\n\n(8.314 J/mol·K * 298.15 K) / (1 * 96,485 C/mol) = 0.0257 V\n\nNow, we can calculate the equilibrium potential (E):\n\nE = 0.80 V - 0.0257 V * ln(0.1)\nE ≈ 0.80 V + 0.0257 V * 2.303\nE ≈ 0.80 V + 0.0592 V\nE ≈ 0.8592 V\n\nFinally, we can determine the overpotential (η) by subtracting the equilibrium potential (E) from the actual potential (E_actual) measured for the cell:\n\nη = E_actual - E\nη = 0.85 V - 0.8592 V\nη ≈ -0.0092 V\n\nThe overpotential required for the reduction of Ag+ to Ag in this half-cell is approximately -0.0092 V. This negative value indicates that the actual potential is slightly lower than the equilibrium potential, which means the reaction is slightly more favorable than predicted by the standard potential."
