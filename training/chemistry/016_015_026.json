    "message_2": "To calculate the heat of crystallization, we first need to determine the amount of heat released when the sodium acetate trihydrate is cooled from 50°C to 10°C. \n\nThe molar mass of sodium acetate trihydrate is the sum of the molar mass of sodium acetate (82.03 g/mol) and three times the molar mass of water (3 * 18.015 g/mol). \n\nMolar mass of sodium acetate trihydrate = 82.03 + 3 * 18.015 = 82.03 + 54.045 = 136.075 g/mol\n\nNow, we need to find the moles of sodium acetate trihydrate in the 10 grams sample.\n\nmoles = mass / molar mass = 10 g / 136.075 g/mol = 0.0735 mol\n\nNext, we need to calculate the heat released when the sodium acetate trihydrate is cooled from 50°C to 10°C. We will use the specific heat capacity of water (4.18 J/g°C) as an approximation for the specific heat capacity of the sodium acetate trihydrate solution.\n\nΔT = T_final - T_initial = 10°C - 50°C = -40°C\n\nq = mcΔT\nwhere q is the heat released, m is the mass of the sample (10 g), c is the specific heat capacity (4.18 J/g°C), and ΔT is the change in temperature (-40°C).\n\nq = (10 g)(4.18 J/g°C)(-40°C) = -1672 J\n\nSince the heat released is negative, it means that the sodium acetate trihydrate is losing heat as it cools down.\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat of crystallization per mole of sodium acetate trihydrate.\n\nHeat of crystallization = q / moles = -1672 J / 0.0735 mol = -22754 J/mol\n\nThe heat of crystallization of sodium acetate trihydrate when it is cooled from 50°C to 10°C and crystallizes is approximately -22,754 J/mol."
