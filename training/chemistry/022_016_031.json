    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH_reaction = Σ ΔH_products - Σ ΔH_reactants\n\nIn this case, the reactants are 2 moles of methane (CH₄) and 4 moles of oxygen (O₂), and the products are 2 moles of carbon dioxide (CO₂) and 4 moles of water vapor (H₂O).\n\nFirst, we need to find the total enthalpy change for the reactants. Since the enthalpy change of combustion of methane is given, we can use that value directly:\n\nΔH_reactants = 2 moles CH₄ × (-890.4 kJ/mol) = -1780.8 kJ\n\nNext, we need to find the total enthalpy change for the products. We can use the given enthalpy changes of formation for CO₂ and H₂O:\n\nΔH_products = (2 moles CO₂ × -393.5 kJ/mol) + (4 moles H₂O × -241.8 kJ/mol) = -787.0 kJ - 967.2 kJ = -1754.2 kJ\n\nNow we can calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nΔH_reaction = (-1754.2 kJ) - (-1780.8 kJ) = 26.6 kJ\n\nSo the enthalpy change for the reaction is 26.6 kJ."
