    "message_2": "The half-life of a radioactive isotope can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nHalf-life (T) = ln(2) / decay constant (λ)\n\nGiven the decay constant (λ) of uranium-238 is 1.54 x 10^-10 s^-1, we can calculate its half-life as follows:\n\nT = ln(2) / (1.54 x 10^-10 s^-1)\n\nT ≈ 0.693 / (1.54 x 10^-10 s^-1)\n\nT ≈ 4.50 x 10^9 s\n\nTo convert seconds to years, divide by the number of seconds in a year (approximately 3.1536 x 10^7 s/year):\n\nT ≈ 4.50 x 10^9 s / (3.1536 x 10^7 s/year)\n\nT ≈ 142.7 million years\n\nSo, the half-life of uranium-238 is approximately 142.7 million years."
