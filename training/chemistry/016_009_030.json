    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy of vaporization of water at 25°C, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates the vapor pressure of a substance at different temperatures to its enthalpy of vaporization. The equation is:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2 (in Kelvin), ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization, and R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K).\n\nFirst, we need to find the vapor pressures of water at 25°C and 100°C. We can use the Antoine equation to estimate these values:\n\nlog10(P) = A - B / (T + C)\n\nFor water, the constants A, B, and C are 8.07131, 1730.63, and 233.426, respectively. Let's calculate the vapor pressures at 25°C (T1 = 298.15 K) and 100°C (T2 = 373.15 K):\n\nlog10(P1) = 8.07131 - 1730.63 / (298.15 + 233.426)\nP1 = 10^(3.169) = 1469.5 Pa\n\nlog10(P2) = 8.07131 - 1730.63 / (373.15 + 233.426)\nP2 = 10^(4.757) = 56800.6 Pa\n\nNow we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to find the enthalpy of vaporization at 25°C:\n\nln(56800.6/1469.5) = -ΔHvap/8.314 * (1/298.15 - 1/373.15)\n3.93 = ΔHvap * (0.00336 - 0.00268) / 8.314\n3.93 = ΔHvap * 0.00068 / 8.314\n\nSolving for ΔHvap:\n\nΔHvap = 3.93 * 8.314 / 0.00068 = 47800 J/mol = 47.8 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the enthalpy of vaporization of water at 25°C is approximately 47.8 kJ/mol."
