    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the following formula:\n\nΔH_reaction = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH_reaction is the standard enthalpy change for the reaction, ΔH_f(products) is the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of the products, and ΔH_f(reactants) is the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of the reactants.\n\nFor this reaction, we have:\n\nΔH_f(CaO) = -635.1 kJ/mol\nΔH_f(H2O) = -285.8 kJ/mol\nΔH_f(Ca(OH)2) = -986.2 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nΔH_reaction = [ΔH_f(Ca(OH)2)] - [ΔH_f(CaO) + ΔH_f(H2O)]\n\nΔH_reaction = (-986.2 kJ/mol) - (-635.1 kJ/mol + -285.8 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH_reaction = (-986.2 kJ/mol) - (-920.9 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH_reaction = -65.3 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change for the reaction between calcium oxide and water to form calcium hydroxide is -65.3 kJ/mol."
