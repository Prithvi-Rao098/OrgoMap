    "message_1": "A chemistry student wants to determine the specific heat capacity of an unknown metal. The student performs a calorimetry experiment and records the following data: \n\n- 50 mL of water at 25°C was added to a calorimeter. \n- The initial temperature of the metal was 100°C. \n- The final temperature of the metal and water mixture was 30°C. \n- The mass of the metal was 100 grams.\n\nWhat is the specific heat capacity of the metal?",
    "message_2": "To determine the specific heat capacity of the metal, we can use the formula for heat transfer in a calorimetry experiment:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the heat transfer, m is the mass, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nSince the heat gained by the water is equal to the heat lost by the metal, we can set up the following equation:\n\nQ_water = Q_metal\n\nFor water, the specific heat capacity (c_water) is 4.18 J/g°C. The mass of the water (m_water) can be assumed to be equal to its volume in milliliters, so m_water = 50 g. The change in temperature for water (ΔT_water) is the final temperature minus the initial temperature: 30°C - 25°C = 5°C.\n\nFor the metal, we have the mass (m_metal) as 100 g, and we need to find the specific heat capacity (c_metal). The change in temperature for the metal (ΔT_metal) is the initial temperature minus the final temperature: 100°C - 30°C = 70°C.\n\nNow we can set up the equation:\n\nm_water * c_water * ΔT_water = m_metal * c_metal * ΔT_metal\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n(50 g) * (4.18 J/g°C) * (5°C) = (100 g) * c_metal * (70°C)\n\nSolving for c_metal:\n\n(50 * 4.18 * 5) / (100 * 70) = c_metal\n\nc_metal ≈ 0.149 J/g°C\n\nThe specific heat capacity of the unknown metal is approximately 0.149 J/g°C."
