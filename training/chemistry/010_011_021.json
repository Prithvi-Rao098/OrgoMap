    "message_1": "What is the efficiency of an electrochemical cell with a potential difference of 2.5 V and a current of 0.5 A, if the cell runs for 1 hour and the total energy supplied to the cell is 5000 J? (Assume 100% efficiency for any non-electrical sources of energy conversion within the cell.)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the efficiency of the electrochemical cell, we need to find the electrical energy output and compare it to the total energy input.\n\nFirst, let's find the electrical energy output. The formula for electrical power is:\n\nPower (P) = Voltage (V) × Current (I)\n\nIn this case, the voltage is 2.5 V and the current is 0.5 A, so:\n\nP = 2.5 V × 0.5 A = 1.25 W (watts)\n\nNow, we need to find the total energy output over the 1-hour period. The formula for energy is:\n\nEnergy (E) = Power (P) × Time (t)\n\nSince the cell runs for 1 hour, we need to convert that to seconds:\n\n1 hour = 1 × 60 × 60 = 3600 seconds\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy output:\n\nE = 1.25 W × 3600 s = 4500 J (joules)\n\nNow that we have the electrical energy output (4500 J) and the total energy input (5000 J), we can calculate the efficiency:\n\nEfficiency = (Electrical Energy Output / Total Energy Input) × 100%\n\nEfficiency = (4500 J / 5000 J) × 100% = 0.9 × 100% = 90%\n\nSo, the efficiency of the electrochemical cell is 90%."
