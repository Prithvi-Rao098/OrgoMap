    "message_2": "To find the pH of the resulting solution, we first need to determine the moles of HCl and NaOH and then find the moles of the remaining acid or base.\n\n1. Calculate the moles of HCl and NaOH:\nMoles of HCl = volume (L) × concentration (M)\nMoles of HCl = 0.025 L × 0.1 M = 0.0025 moles\n\nMoles of NaOH = volume (L) × concentration (M)\nMoles of NaOH = 0.050 L × 0.2 M = 0.01 moles\n\n2. Determine the moles of the remaining acid or base:\nSince NaOH is in excess, we will have some remaining moles of NaOH after the reaction with HCl.\nMoles of remaining NaOH = moles of NaOH - moles of HCl\nMoles of remaining NaOH = 0.01 - 0.0025 = 0.0075 moles\n\n3. Calculate the concentration of the remaining base (NaOH) in the final solution:\nTotal volume of the solution = volume of HCl + volume of NaOH = 25 mL + 50 mL = 75 mL = 0.075 L\n\nConcentration of remaining NaOH = moles of remaining NaOH / total volume (L)\nConcentration of remaining NaOH = 0.0075 moles / 0.075 L = 0.1 M\n\n4. Calculate the pH of the solution:\nSince NaOH is a strong base, we can use the following formula to calculate the pOH of the solution:\npOH = -log10[OH-]\npOH = -log10(0.1) = 1\n\nNow, we can use the relationship between pH and pOH to find the pH of the solution:\npH + pOH = 14\npH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1 = 13\n\nThe pH of the solution when 25 mL of 0.1 M HCl is added to 50 mL of 0.2 M NaOH solution is 13."
