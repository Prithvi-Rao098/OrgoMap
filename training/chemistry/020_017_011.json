    "message_1": "What is the equilibrium constant for the formation of hexaaquacobalt(II) ion from the reactants cobalt(II) ions and water, given that the concentration of the cobalt(II) ions is 0.10M and the concentration of water is 55.5M (assuming infinite excess), and the equilibrium concentration of hexaaquacobalt(II) ion is found to be 0.08M at equilibrium?",
    "message_2": "The reaction for the formation of hexaaquacobalt(II) ion can be written as:\n\nCo²⁺(aq) + 6H₂O(l) ⇌ [Co(H₂O)₆]²⁺(aq)\n\nTo find the equilibrium constant (K), we will use the equilibrium concentrations of the species involved in the reaction. Since water is in excess, its concentration will not change significantly during the reaction, and we can treat it as a constant.\n\nAt equilibrium, the concentrations are:\n\n[Co²⁺] = 0.10 M - 0.08 M = 0.02 M\n[Co(H₂O)₆]²⁺ = 0.08 M\n\nNow, we can write the expression for the equilibrium constant:\n\nK = [Co(H₂O)₆]²⁺ / ([Co²⁺] * [H₂O]⁶)\n\nSince the concentration of water is in excess and remains constant, we can define a new constant K' that includes the water concentration:\n\nK' = K * [H₂O]⁶\n\nNow, we can calculate K':\n\nK' = [Co(H₂O)₆]²⁺ / [Co²⁺] = (0.08 M) / (0.02 M) = 4\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant K' for the formation of hexaaquacobalt(II) ion, considering the constant concentration of water, is 4."
