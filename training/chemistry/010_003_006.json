    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the electrochemical reaction, we first need to determine the overall cell potential (E°cell) for the reaction. The cell potential is the difference between the reduction potentials of the two half-reactions:\n\nE°cell = E°(cathode) - E°(anode)\n\nIn this case, the Cu2+/Cu half-reaction acts as the cathode (reduction) and the Zn2+/Zn half-reaction acts as the anode (oxidation):\n\nE°cell = E°(Cu2+/Cu) - E°(Zn2+/Zn) = 0.34 V - (-0.76 V) = 1.10 V\n\nNow that we have the cell potential, we can calculate the Gibbs free energy change using the following equation:\n\nΔG = -nFE°cell\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the reaction, F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol), and E°cell is the cell potential.\n\nFor this reaction, the balanced redox reaction is:\n\nZn(s) + Cu2+(aq) → Zn2+(aq) + Cu(s)\n\nThe number of moles of electrons transferred (n) is 2, as one Zn atom loses 2 electrons and one Cu2+ ion gains 2 electrons.\n\nNow we can calculate ΔG:\n\nΔG = -nFE°cell = -2 mol * 96,485 C/mol * 1.10 V = -212,667 J/mol\n\nSince it's common to express Gibbs free energy change in kJ/mol, we can convert it:\n\nΔG = -212,667 J/mol * (1 kJ/1000 J) = -212.67 kJ/mol\n\nSo the Gibbs free energy change for the electrochemical reaction is -212.67 kJ/mol."
