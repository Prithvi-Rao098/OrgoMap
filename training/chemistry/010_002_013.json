    "message_2": "To determine the oxidation state of chlorine in NaClO3, we can use the rules of electrochemistry as follows:\n\n1. The oxidation state of an element in its elemental form is 0.\n2. The oxidation state of a monatomic ion is equal to its charge.\n3. The sum of the oxidation states of all atoms in a molecule or ion is equal to the overall charge of the molecule or ion.\n\nIn NaClO3, we have three elements: sodium (Na), chlorine (Cl), and oxygen (O).\n\nAccording to rule 2, the oxidation state of Na is +1, as it is a monatomic ion with a charge of +1.\n\nOxygen usually has an oxidation state of -2 (except in peroxides and superoxides). In this case, there are three oxygen atoms, each with an oxidation state of -2, so the total oxidation state for oxygen is -6.\n\nNow, we can use rule 3 to find the oxidation state of chlorine. The overall charge of the NaClO3 molecule is 0, so the sum of the oxidation states of Na, Cl, and O should equal 0:\n\n(+1) + (Cl oxidation state) + (-6) = 0\n\nSolving for the Cl oxidation state:\n\nCl oxidation state = 0 - (+1) + 6\nCl oxidation state = +5\n\nTherefore, the oxidation state of chlorine in NaClO3 is +5."
