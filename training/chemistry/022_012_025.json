    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of moles and the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid:\n\nNaOH + HCl → NaCl + H₂O\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of NaOH reacts with 1 mole of HCl.\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of HCl in the 25 mL of 0.10 M solution:\n\nmoles of HCl = (volume in L) × (molarity)\nmoles of HCl = (25 mL × (1 L / 1000 mL)) × 0.10 M\nmoles of HCl = 0.0025 L × 0.10 mol/L\nmoles of HCl = 0.00025 mol\n\nSince the mole ratio of NaOH to HCl is 1:1, we need the same number of moles of NaOH to neutralize the HCl:\n\nmoles of NaOH = 0.00025 mol\n\nNow, we need to find the mass of NaOH required. The molar mass of NaOH is approximately 22.99 g/mol (Na) + 15.999 g/mol (O) + 1.007 g/mol (H) = 39.996 g/mol.\n\nmass of NaOH = (moles of NaOH) × (molar mass of NaOH)\nmass of NaOH = 0.00025 mol × 39.996 g/mol\nmass of NaOH ≈ 0.01 g\n\nTherefore, approximately 0.01 g of sodium hydroxide is required to neutralize 25 mL of 0.10 M hydrochloric acid."
