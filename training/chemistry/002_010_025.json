    "message_2": "To calculate the density of solid sodium chloride, we can use the formula:\n\nDensity = Mass / Volume\n\nGiven the mass of sodium chloride is 5.50 g and its volume is 2.50 cm³, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nDensity = 5.50 g / 2.50 cm³\n\nDensity = 2.20 g/cm³\n\nThe density of solid sodium chloride is 2.20 g/cm³."
