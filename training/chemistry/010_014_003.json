    "message_1": "Consider a zinc electrode in a concentration cell that is connected to a copper electrode through a salt bridge. During the electrolysis of an aqueous solution of ZnSO4, a current of 2.5 A is passed through the cell for 20 minutes. Calculate the mass of zinc deposited on the electrode during this time assuming 100% efficiency. (Molar mass of zinc = 65.38 g/mol)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the mass of zinc deposited on the electrode, we can use Faraday's law of electrolysis. Faraday's law states that the amount of substance deposited or dissolved at an electrode is directly proportional to the amount of charge passed through the cell.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total charge passed through the cell. We know that current (I) is equal to the charge (Q) divided by time (t). Rearranging this equation, we get:\n\nQ = I × t\n\nGiven the current (I) is 2.5 A and the time (t) is 20 minutes (which we need to convert to seconds), we can calculate the total charge:\n\nQ = 2.5 A × (20 × 60) s = 2.5 A × 1200 s = 3000 C (Coulombs)\n\nNow, we need to find the number of moles of electrons passed through the cell. We can use Faraday's constant (F), which is approximately 96485 C/mol:\n\nn = Q / F = 3000 C / 96485 C/mol ≈ 0.0311 mol of electrons\n\nThe balanced half-reaction for the deposition of zinc is:\n\nZn²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Zn\n\nFrom the stoichiometry of the reaction, we can see that 2 moles of electrons are required to deposit 1 mole of zinc. Therefore, we can find the number of moles of zinc deposited:\n\nmoles of Zn = 0.0311 mol of electrons / 2 = 0.01555 mol of Zn\n\nFinally, we can calculate the mass of zinc deposited using the molar mass of zinc (65.38 g/mol):\n\nmass of Zn = 0.01555 mol of Zn × 65.38 g/mol ≈ 1.016 g\n\nSo, the mass of zinc deposited on the electrode during this time is approximately 1.016 g, assuming 100% efficiency."
