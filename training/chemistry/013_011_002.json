    "message_2": "The critical micelle concentration (CMC) of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in water at 25°C is approximately 8.2 mM (millimolar).\n\nThe CMC of SDS is influenced by temperature. As the temperature increases, the CMC generally decreases. This is because the hydrophobic effect, which drives micelle formation, becomes stronger at higher temperatures. The exact change in CMC with temperature can vary depending on the specific conditions and presence of other solutes in the solution. However, it is important to note that the change in CMC with temperature is typically not very drastic for SDS in water."
