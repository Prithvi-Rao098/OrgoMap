    "message_1": "What is the equilibrium constant for the reaction: 2 SO2(g) + O2(g) ⇌ 2 SO3(g), if at equilibrium the concentration of SO2 is 0.20 M, O2 is 0.15 M, and SO3 is 0.23 M?",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction, we can use the expression:\n\nKc = [SO3]^2 / ([SO2]^2 * [O2])\n\nAt equilibrium, the concentrations are given as [SO2] = 0.20 M, [O2] = 0.15 M, and [SO3] = 0.23 M. Plugging these values into the expression, we get:\n\nKc = (0.23)^2 / ((0.20)^2 * (0.15))\n\nKc = 0.0529 / (0.004 * 0.15)\n\nKc = 0.0529 / 0.0006\n\nKc ≈ 88.17\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant for the reaction is approximately 88.17."
