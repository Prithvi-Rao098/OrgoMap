    "message_2": "To determine the mass percentage of copper in a 5.00-gram sample of brass using gravimetric analysis, we need to know the mass of copper in the sample. Brass is an alloy composed of copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn), and its composition can vary. Typically, brass contains 60-80% copper and 20-40% zinc.\n\nTo perform gravimetric analysis, we would need to carry out a series of chemical reactions and measurements to isolate the copper in the sample and measure its mass. However, without specific information about the sample or the experimental setup, we cannot provide a precise answer.\n\nIf you have information about the composition of the brass sample or the results of a gravimetric analysis, we can help you calculate the mass percentage of copper."
