    "message_1": "What is the new equilibrium constant of the reaction N2(g) + 3H2(g) <--> 2NH3(g) if the temperature is increased from 400K to 500K and the value of the initial equilibrium constant is 2.34 x 10^-5?",
    "message_2": "To determine the new equilibrium constant, we need to use the van't Hoff equation, which relates the change in temperature to the change in the equilibrium constant:\n\nln(K2/K1) = -ΔH°/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nIn this equation, K1 is the initial equilibrium constant (2.34 x 10^-5), K2 is the new equilibrium constant, ΔH° is the standard enthalpy change of the reaction, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T1 is the initial temperature (400 K), and T2 is the final temperature (500 K).\n\nHowever, we do not have the value of ΔH° for the reaction. The standard enthalpy change for the formation of ammonia (NH3) from nitrogen (N2) and hydrogen (H2) is typically around -92 kJ/mol. Assuming this value, we can now solve for K2:\n\nln(K2/(2.34 x 10^-5)) = -(-92,000 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K) * (1/500 K - 1/400 K)\n\nSolving for K2:\n\nK2 = (2.34 x 10^-5) * exp((-(-92,000 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K)) * (1/500 K - 1/400 K))\nK2 ≈ 1.21 x 10^-4\n\nSo, the new equilibrium constant (K2) at 500 K is approximately 1.21 x 10^-4."
