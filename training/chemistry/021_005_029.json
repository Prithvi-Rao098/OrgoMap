    "message_2": "The bond in hydrogen chloride (HCl) is polar. This is because the electronegativity difference between hydrogen (2.20) and chlorine (3.16) is significant, leading to an unequal sharing of electrons and creating a dipole moment. The chlorine atom attracts the electrons more strongly, making it partially negative (δ-), while the hydrogen atom becomes partially positive (δ+)."
