    "message_2": "For a second-order reaction, the rate law can be expressed as:\n\nRate = k[A]^m[B]^n\n\nwhere Rate is the reaction rate, k is the rate constant (0.002 M^-1s^-1 in this case), [A] and [B] are the concentrations of reactants A and B, and m and n are the orders of the reaction with respect to A and B.\n\nSince the reaction is second-order, the sum of m and n is 2. We are given that the concentration of reactant B is fixed, so we can assume that the reaction is second-order with respect to reactant A (m = 2) and zero-order with respect to reactant B (n = 0).\n\nNow, the rate law becomes:\n\nRate = k[A]^2\n\nLet's consider the initial rate when the concentration of A is doubled:\n\nRate' = k(2[A])^2\nRate' = k(4[A]^2)\nRate' = 4k[A]^2\n\nNow, let's compare the new rate (Rate') to the initial rate (Rate):\n\nRate'/Rate = (4k[A]^2) / (k[A]^2)\n\nThe k[A]^2 terms cancel out:\n\nRate'/Rate = 4\n\nSo, when the concentration of reactant A is doubled, the initial rate of the second-order reaction increases by a factor of 4."
