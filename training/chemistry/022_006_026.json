    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the balanced chemical equation for the reaction and the concept of stoichiometry.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction between calcium oxide (CaO) and sulfur trioxide (SO3) to produce calcium sulfate (CaSO4) is:\n\nCaO + SO3 → CaSO4\n\nNow, we need to find the molar mass of each substance involved in the reaction:\n\n- Calcium oxide (CaO): Ca = 40.08 g/mol, O = 16.00 g/mol, so CaO = 40.08 + 16.00 = 56.08 g/mol\n- Calcium sulfate (CaSO4): Ca = 40.08 g/mol, S = 32.07 g/mol, O = 16.00 g/mol (4 oxygen atoms), so CaSO4 = 40.08 + 32.07 + (4 × 16.00) = 136.15 g/mol\n\nNow, we need to convert the given mass of calcium oxide (100 g) to moles:\n\nmoles of CaO = mass of CaO / molar mass of CaO = 100 g / 56.08 g/mol = 1.783 moles\n\nAccording to the balanced chemical equation, 1 mole of CaO reacts with 1 mole of SO3 to produce 1 mole of CaSO4. Therefore, the moles of CaSO4 produced will be equal to the moles of CaO reacted:\n\nmoles of CaSO4 = 1.783 moles\n\nNow, we can convert the moles of CaSO4 to mass:\n\nmass of CaSO4 = moles of CaSO4 × molar mass of CaSO4 = 1.783 moles × 136.15 g/mol = 242.88 g\n\nSo, 242.88 g of calcium sulfate (CaSO4) can be produced when 100 g of calcium oxide (CaO) reacts with excess sulfur trioxide (SO3) in a synthesis reaction."
