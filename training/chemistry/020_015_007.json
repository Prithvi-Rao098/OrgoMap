    "message_2": "When hydrochloric acid (HCl) is added to a solution containing acetic acid (CH3COOH), the equilibrium position will shift to the left. This is because HCl is a strong acid that will dissociate completely in the solution, increasing the concentration of H+ ions.\n\nThe reaction for the dissociation of acetic acid is as follows:\n\nCH3COOH (aq) â‡Œ CH3COO- (aq) + H+ (aq)\n\nAccording to Le Chatelier's principle, when a change is made to a system in equilibrium, the system will adjust to counteract the change and restore equilibrium. In this case, the addition of HCl increases the concentration of H+ ions in the solution. To counteract this change, the equilibrium will shift to the left, favoring the formation of acetic acid (CH3COOH) and reducing the concentration of acetate ions (CH3COO-) and H+ ions.\n\nAs a result, the equilibrium position of acetic acid will shift to the left when hydrochloric acid is added to the solution."
