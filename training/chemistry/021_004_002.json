    "message_2": "The hybridization of the oxygen atom in the molecule H2O (water) is sp3. This is because oxygen has two lone pairs and forms two sigma bonds with the two hydrogen atoms, resulting in a total of four electron domains. These four electron domains require the oxygen atom to adopt an sp3 hybridization to accommodate them."
