    "message_2": "The nitrate ion (NO3-) has three possible resonance structures. In each structure, the nitrogen atom is at the center, and the three oxygen atoms are bonded to it. The nitrogen atom has a positive charge, and one of the oxygen atoms has a negative charge in each resonance structure. The other two oxygen atoms have a double bond with the nitrogen atom.\n\nResonance Structure 1:\nO=N-O(-)-O\n\nResonance Structure 2:\nO(-)-N=O-O\n\nResonance Structure 3:\nO-O(-)-N=O\n\nThe delocalization of electrons can be illustrated using curved arrows as follows:\n\n1. In Resonance Structure 1, the lone pair of electrons on the negatively charged oxygen atom forms a double bond with the nitrogen atom, and the double bond between nitrogen and one of the other oxygen atoms breaks, moving the electrons to the oxygen atom, creating a new negative charge.\n\nO=N-O(-)-O → O(-)-N=O-O\n\n2. In Resonance Structure 2, the lone pair of electrons on the negatively charged oxygen atom forms a double bond with the nitrogen atom, and the double bond between nitrogen and one of the other oxygen atoms breaks, moving the electrons to the oxygen atom, creating a new negative charge.\n\nO(-)-N=O-O → O-O(-)-N=O\n\n3. In Resonance Structure 3, the lone pair of electrons on the negatively charged oxygen atom forms a double bond with the nitrogen atom, and the double bond between nitrogen and one of the other oxygen atoms breaks, moving the electrons to the oxygen atom, creating a new negative charge.\n\nO-O(-)-N=O → O=N-O(-)-O\n\nThese resonance structures contribute to the stability of the nitrate ion because the negative charge is delocalized over the three oxygen atoms, which reduces the overall charge density on any single atom. This delocalization of electrons also allows the molecule to have a lower overall energy, making it more stable. Additionally, the resonance structures give the nitrate ion a symmetrical distribution of charge, which further contributes to its stability."
