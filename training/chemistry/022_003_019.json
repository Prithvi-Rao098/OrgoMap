    "message_2": "To find the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid, we can use the formula for the dissociation constant (Ka) and the definition of pH. The dissociation of acetic acid (CH3COOH) in water can be represented as:\n\nCH3COOH ⇌ CH3COO- + H+\n\nThe Ka expression for this reaction is:\n\nKa = [CH3COO-][H+] / [CH3COOH]\n\nLet x be the concentration of H+ ions and CH3COO- ions at equilibrium. Since the initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.1 M, the equilibrium concentrations can be represented as:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.1 - x\n[CH3COO-] = x\n[H+] = x\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the Ka expression:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 = (x)(x) / (0.1 - x)\n\nSince Ka is very small, we can assume that x is also very small compared to 0.1, so we can approximate (0.1 - x) as 0.1:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 = x^2 / 0.1\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx^2 = 1.8 x 10^-5 * 0.1\nx^2 = 1.8 x 10^-6\nx = √(1.8 x 10^-6)\nx ≈ 1.34 x 10^-3\n\nSince x represents the concentration of H+ ions, [H+] ≈ 1.34 x 10^-3 M. Now, we can find the pH using the definition of pH:\n\npH = -log10[H+]\npH = -log10(1.34 x 10^-3)\npH ≈ 2.87\n\nTherefore, the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid is approximately 2.87."
