    "message_2": "First, let's write the balanced equation for the formation of hydrogen chloride (HCl) from its elements in their standard states:\n\nH2 (g) + Cl2 (g) → 2 HCl (g)\n\nNow, we can use the given enthalpy values to calculate the enthalpy change of formation of hydrogen chloride (HCl). The enthalpy change of formation (ΔHf) of a compound is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of the compound is formed from its elements in their standard states.\n\nSince the enthalpy change of formation of hydrogen gas (H2) and chlorine gas (Cl2) are both 0 kJ/mol, we only need to consider the enthalpy change of reaction for the formation of hydrogen chloride gas (HCl), which is -92.3 kJ/mol. However, the balanced equation shows that 2 moles of HCl are formed in the reaction. To find the enthalpy change of formation for 1 mole of HCl, we need to divide the enthalpy change of reaction by 2:\n\nΔHf (HCl) = (-92.3 kJ/mol) / 2 = -46.15 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the enthalpy change of formation of hydrogen chloride (HCl) is -46.15 kJ/mol."
