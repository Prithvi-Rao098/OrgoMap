    "message_2": "Optimizing the design of a cosmetic production system involves a combination of process improvements, equipment upgrades, and quality control measures. Here are some steps to consider:\n\n1. Raw material selection: Choose high-quality raw materials that meet industry standards and have a low environmental impact. This will help ensure the safety and quality of the final product while reducing waste.\n\n2. Efficient production processes: Implement lean manufacturing principles to streamline production processes, reduce waste, and improve efficiency. This may involve reorganizing the production layout, reducing batch sizes, and minimizing work-in-progress inventory.\n\n3. Equipment upgrades: Invest in modern, energy-efficient equipment that can improve production efficiency and reduce waste. For example, consider using automated filling and packaging systems to minimize product loss and ensure consistent product quality.\n\n4. Waste reduction: Implement waste reduction strategies, such as recycling and reusing materials whenever possible. This may involve working with suppliers to develop returnable packaging or using recyclable materials in product packaging.\n\n5. Quality control: Establish a robust quality control system to ensure the safety and quality of the final product. This may involve regular testing of raw materials, in-process samples, and finished products to ensure they meet industry standards. Additionally, implement a traceability system to track products throughout the supply chain and quickly identify any issues.\n\n6. Employee training: Provide ongoing training for employees to ensure they understand the importance of waste reduction, efficiency, and quality control. Encourage a culture of continuous improvement where employees are empowered to suggest and implement process improvements.\n\n7. Energy efficiency: Implement energy-saving measures throughout the production facility, such as using energy-efficient lighting, optimizing heating and cooling systems, and using renewable energy sources when possible.\n\n8. Regular maintenance: Schedule regular maintenance for equipment to ensure it operates at peak efficiency and reduce the risk of breakdowns and production downtime.\n\n9. Continuous improvement: Regularly review and analyze production data to identify areas for improvement. Implement changes and monitor their effectiveness to continuously optimize the production system.\n\n10. Collaboration with stakeholders: Work closely with suppliers, customers, and regulatory agencies to ensure that the production system meets their requirements and expectations. This collaboration can help identify opportunities for improvement and ensure the long-term success of the production system."
