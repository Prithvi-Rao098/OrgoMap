    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Arrhenius equation, which relates the rate constant (k) of a reaction to its activation energy (Ea), temperature (T), and the pre-exponential factor (A):\n\nk = A * e^(-Ea / R * T)\n\nwhere:\nk = rate constant\nA = pre-exponential factor\nEa = activation energy (J/mol)\nR = gas constant (8.314 J/mol*K)\nT = temperature (K)\n\nWe are given two rate constants (k1 and k2) at two different temperatures (T1 and T2). We can set up two equations using the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk1 = A * e^(-Ea / R * T1)\nk2 = A * e^(-Ea / R * T2)\n\nNow, we can divide the first equation by the second equation to eliminate the pre-exponential factor (A):\n\nk1 / k2 = e^(-Ea / R * T1) / e^(-Ea / R * T2)\n\nNext, we can simplify the equation by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(k1 / k2) = (-Ea / R * T1) - (-Ea / R * T2)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nk1 = 4.5 x 10^-4 s^-1\nk2 = 2.5 x 10^-3 s^-1\nT1 = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\nT2 = 35°C + 273.15 = 308.15 K\nR = 8.314 J/mol*K\n\nln(4.5 x 10^-4 / 2.5 x 10^-3) = (-Ea / 8.314 * 298.15) - (-Ea / 8.314 * 308.15)\n\nNow, we can solve for Ea:\n\nln(0.18) = (Ea / 8.314) * (1/308.15 - 1/298.15)\n\nEa = 8.314 * ln(0.18) / (1/308.15 - 1/298.15)\n\nEa ≈ 49060 J/mol\n\nThe activation energy of the chemical reaction is approximately 49,060 J/mol."
