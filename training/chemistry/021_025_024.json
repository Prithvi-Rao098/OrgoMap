    "message_2": "The type of bonding in sodium chloride (NaCl) is ionic bonding. Ionic bonding occurs when there is a transfer of electrons between a metal and a non-metal atom, resulting in the formation of positively charged cations and negatively charged anions. In the case of NaCl, sodium (Na) is a metal, and chlorine (Cl) is a non-metal.\n\nEvidence from its structure and properties supporting the presence of ionic bonding in NaCl includes:\n\n1. Crystal lattice structure: Sodium chloride forms a regular, repeating pattern known as a crystal lattice. In this structure, each sodium ion (Na+) is surrounded by six chloride ions (Cl-), and each chloride ion is surrounded by six sodium ions. This arrangement is a result of the electrostatic attraction between the oppositely charged ions.\n\n2. High melting and boiling points: NaCl has a high melting point (801°C) and boiling point (1413°C). This is because a significant amount of energy is required to overcome the strong electrostatic forces between the positively charged sodium ions and the negatively charged chloride ions in the crystal lattice.\n\n3. Solubility in water: Sodium chloride is soluble in water, which is a polar solvent. When NaCl is dissolved in water, the polar water molecules surround the Na+ and Cl- ions, separating them from the crystal lattice and allowing them to dissolve. This process is known as hydration.\n\n4. Electrical conductivity: In its solid state, NaCl does not conduct electricity because the ions are held in a fixed position within the crystal lattice. However, when dissolved in water or melted, the Na+ and Cl- ions are free to move, allowing the substance to conduct electricity. This is a characteristic property of ionic compounds.\n\n5. Formation from a metal and a non-metal: Sodium is a metal from Group 1 of the periodic table, and chlorine is a non-metal from Group 17. Metals tend to lose electrons to form positive ions, while non-metals tend to gain electrons to form negative ions. In the case of NaCl, sodium loses one electron to become Na+, and chlorine gains one electron to become Cl-. This transfer of electrons results in the formation of an ionic bond."
