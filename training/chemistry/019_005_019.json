    "message_2": "To calculate the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) for the reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°\n\nwhere ΔH° is the standard enthalpy change, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ΔS° is the standard entropy change.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the reaction. We can do this using the given standard enthalpies of formation:\n\nΔH°(reaction) = ΣΔH°(products) - ΣΔH°(reactants)\n\nFor this reaction, we have:\n\nΔH°(reaction) = [1 × ΔH°(Fe2O3)] - [2 × ΔH°(Fe) + 3/2 × ΔH°(O2)]\n\nSince the standard enthalpy of formation of Fe(s) and O2(g) are both 0 kJ/mol, the equation simplifies to:\n\nΔH°(reaction) = [1 × (-822.2 kJ/mol)] - [0 + 0]\nΔH°(reaction) = -822.2 kJ/mol\n\nNow we can calculate the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) using the equation:\n\nΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°\n\nΔG° = (-822.2 kJ/mol) - (298 K × 87.4 J/mol K)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the entropy change from J/mol K to kJ/mol K:\n\n87.4 J/mol K × (1 kJ / 1000 J) = 0.0874 kJ/mol K\n\nNow we can plug this value into the equation:\n\nΔG° = (-822.2 kJ/mol) - (298 K × 0.0874 kJ/mol K)\nΔG° = -822.2 kJ/mol - 26.0 kJ/mol\nΔG° = -848.2 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) for the reaction is -848.2 kJ/mol."
