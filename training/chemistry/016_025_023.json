(Assume that the heat released is absorbed by the solution and there is no heat lost to the surroundings.)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the dissolution of sodium hydroxide, we can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat absorbed or released, m is the mass of the solution, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nFirst, let's find the mass of the solution. Since we have 10 g of sodium hydroxide and 100 g of water, the total mass of the solution is:\n\nm = 10 g (NaOH) + 100 g (H2O) = 110 g\n\nNext, we need to find the change in temperature. The initial temperature is 25°C and the final temperature is 26.5°C, so the change in temperature is:\n\nΔT = 26.5°C - 25°C = 1.5°C\n\nNow we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nq = (110 g) × (4.18 J g⁻¹ K⁻¹) × (1.5°C)\n\nq = 688.47 J\n\nSince the heat is released during the dissolution process, the enthalpy change is negative:\n\nΔH = -688.47 J\n\nSo, the enthalpy change for the dissolution of 10 g of sodium hydroxide in 100 g of water at 25°C is -688.47 J."
