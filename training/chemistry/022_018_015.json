    "message_2": "To calculate the energy required to break a single carbon-hydrogen bond in a methane molecule (CH4), we can use the given bond dissociation energy (BDE) of the C-H bond.\n\nBDE of C-H bond = 413 kJ/mol\n\nSince there are 4 C-H bonds in a methane molecule, we need to consider only one of them. Therefore, the energy required to break one C-H bond in a methane molecule is the same as the BDE of the C-H bond.\n\nEnergy required to break one C-H bond in CH4 = 413 kJ/mol"
