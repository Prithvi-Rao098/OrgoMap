    "message_2": "The boiling point of magnesium chloride (MgCl2) is not directly related to its melting point. The melting point of MgCl2 is indeed -711째C, but to determine its boiling point, we need to refer to its specific properties. Magnesium chloride has a boiling point of 1412째C (2574째F) under standard pressure."
