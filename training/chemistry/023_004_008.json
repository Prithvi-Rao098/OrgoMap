    "message_2": "To determine the maximum theoretical yield of acetylsalicylic acid, we first need to identify the limiting reactant. We can do this by calculating the moles of each reactant and comparing their mole ratios.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the synthesis of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is:\n\nC7H6O3 (salicylic acid) + C4H6O3 (acetic anhydride) â†’ C9H8O4 (acetylsalicylic acid) + C2H4O2 (acetic acid)\n\nThe molar masses of the reactants are:\nSalicylic acid (C7H6O3): 138.12 g/mol\nAcetic anhydride (C4H6O3): 102.09 g/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the moles of each reactant:\nMoles of salicylic acid = 8 g / 138.12 g/mol = 0.0579 mol\nMoles of acetic anhydride = 10 g / 102.09 g/mol = 0.0979 mol\n\nThe mole ratio of salicylic acid to acetic anhydride in the balanced equation is 1:1. To find the limiting reactant, we compare the mole ratios:\n\n0.0579 mol salicylic acid / 1 = 0.0579\n0.0979 mol acetic anhydride / 1 = 0.0979\n\nSince 0.0579 is smaller than 0.0979, salicylic acid is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow, we can calculate the maximum theoretical yield of acetylsalicylic acid (C9H8O4) using the stoichiometry from the balanced equation:\n\nMoles of acetylsalicylic acid = 0.0579 mol salicylic acid * (1 mol acetylsalicylic acid / 1 mol salicylic acid) = 0.0579 mol\n\nThe molar mass of acetylsalicylic acid (C9H8O4) is 180.16 g/mol. Therefore, the maximum theoretical yield is:\n\n0.0579 mol * 180.16 g/mol = 10.43 g\n\nThe maximum theoretical yield of acetylsalicylic acid that can be obtained from reacting 10 grams of acetic anhydride with 8 grams of salicylic acid is 10.43 grams."
