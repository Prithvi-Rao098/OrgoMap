    "message_2": "The reaction between 1-bromobutane and sodium hydroxide in ethanol is a nucleophilic substitution reaction, specifically an SN2 reaction. In an SN2 reaction, the nucleophile (hydroxide ion) attacks the substrate (1-bromobutane) from the opposite side of the leaving group (bromide ion), leading to an inversion of stereochemistry at the reaction center.\n\nHere's the step-by-step mechanism for the reaction:\n\n1. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) dissociates into sodium (Na+) and hydroxide (OH-) ions in the ethanol solvent.\n\n2. The hydroxide ion (OH-) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon atom (the one bonded to the bromine) in 1-bromobutane. This attack occurs from the opposite side of the leaving group (bromide ion, Br-).\n\n3. The carbon-oxygen bond forms while the carbon-bromine bond breaks simultaneously. The bromide ion (Br-) leaves as a leaving group, and the nucleophile (OH-) replaces it.\n\n4. The product formed is 1-butanol, and the byproduct is the bromide ion (Br-).\n\nThe major product of this reaction is 1-butanol, as the SN2 mechanism leads to a direct substitution of the bromine atom with the hydroxide ion. There are no minor products in this reaction, as the SN2 mechanism is highly selective and specific for primary alkyl halides like 1-bromobutane."
