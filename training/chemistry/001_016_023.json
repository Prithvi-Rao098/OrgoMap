    "message_2": "Keto-enol tautomerism is an equilibrium process that involves the interconversion between a carbonyl compound (keto form) and an enol (an alcohol with a double bond). In the case of cyclohexanone, the keto-enol tautomerism can be described as follows:\n\n1. Keto form: Cyclohexanone\n2. Enol form: Cyclohexenol\n\nHere is the complete mechanism for the keto-enol tautomerism of cyclohexanone:\n\nStep 1: Protonation of the carbonyl oxygen\nA proton from an acid catalyst (usually a weak acid like water or an alcohol) protonates the carbonyl oxygen of cyclohexanone, making it a better leaving group. This forms an oxonium ion intermediate.\n\nCyclohexanone + H⁺ → [Cyclohexanone-OH⁺]\n\nStep 2: Formation of the enol intermediate\nA neighboring carbon-hydrogen bond (α-hydrogen) breaks, and the electrons from this bond form a double bond with the carbonyl carbon. Simultaneously, the oxygen with the positive charge (oxonium ion) loses a proton, forming the enol form of cyclohexanone, called cyclohexenol.\n\n[Cyclohexanone-OH⁺] → Cyclohexenol + H⁺\n\nThe transition state involved in this process is a high-energy state where the α-hydrogen is partially bonded to both the α-carbon and the carbonyl carbon, while the carbonyl oxygen is partially bonded to the hydrogen ion.\n\nThe reverse process (enol to keto) follows the same mechanism but in the opposite direction:\n\nStep 1: Protonation of the enol oxygen\nCyclohexenol + H⁺ → [Cyclohexenol-OH⁺]\n\nStep 2: Formation of the keto form\nThe double bond between the α-carbon and carbonyl carbon breaks, and the electrons from this bond form a new bond with the protonated oxygen. Simultaneously, a new α-hydrogen bond is formed, resulting in the keto form, cyclohexanone.\n\n[Cyclohexenol-OH⁺] → Cyclohexanone + H⁺\n\nThe equilibrium between the keto and enol forms depends on the specific compound and reaction conditions. In most cases, the keto form is more stable and predominant at equilibrium."
