    "message_2": "The standard enthalpy change for the phase transition of water when it freezes is called the enthalpy of fusion. The enthalpy of fusion for water is 6.01 kJ/mol at 0°C and 1 atm pressure. However, you are asking for the enthalpy change at -10°C and 1 atm pressure.\n\nTo determine the enthalpy change at -10°C, we can use the heat capacity of ice and water to calculate the additional energy required to cool the water from 0°C to -10°C before freezing. The heat capacity of ice is approximately 2.09 J/g·K, and the heat capacity of water is approximately 4.18 J/g·K. The molar mass of water is 18.015 g/mol.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the energy required to cool the water from 0°C to -10°C:\n\nq_water = (4.18 J/g·K) × (10 K) × (18.015 g/mol) = 782.99 J/mol\n\nNext, we need to calculate the energy required to cool the ice from 0°C to -10°C:\n\nq_ice = (2.09 J/g·K) × (10 K) × (18.015 g/mol) = 376.52 J/mol\n\nNow, we can find the total enthalpy change for the phase transition at -10°C:\n\nΔH_total = ΔH_fusion + q_water + q_ice\nΔH_total = 6.01 kJ/mol + 0.78299 kJ/mol + 0.37652 kJ/mol\nΔH_total ≈ 7.17 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change for the phase transition reaction of water when it freezes at a temperature of -10°C and a pressure of 1 atm is approximately 7.17 kJ/mol."
