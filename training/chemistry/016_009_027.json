    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of energy required to boil 500g of water starting from 25°C, we need to consider two steps:\n\n1. Heating the water from 25°C to 100°C (the boiling point)\n2. Vaporizing the water at 100°C\n\nFirst, let's calculate the energy required to heat the water from 25°C to 100°C. We will use the specific heat capacity of water, which is 4.18 J/g°C.\n\nq1 = mass × specific heat capacity × ΔT\nq1 = 500g × 4.18 J/g°C × (100°C - 25°C)\nq1 = 500g × 4.18 J/g°C × 75°C\nq1 = 156750 J\n\nNow, let's calculate the energy required to vaporize the water at 100°C. We will use the enthalpy of vaporization of water, which is 40.7 kJ/mol. First, we need to convert the mass of water to moles.\n\nMolar mass of water (H2O) = 18.015 g/mol\nmoles of water = mass / molar mass\nmoles of water = 500g / 18.015 g/mol\nmoles of water ≈ 27.75 mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy required to vaporize the water.\n\nq2 = moles × enthalpy of vaporization\nq2 = 27.75 mol × 40.7 kJ/mol\nq2 ≈ 1129.425 kJ\n\nTo find the total energy required, we need to add the energy required for both steps. Since q1 is in J and q2 is in kJ, we need to convert q1 to kJ.\n\nq1 = 156750 J × (1 kJ / 1000 J) = 156.75 kJ\n\nTotal energy required (q_total) = q1 + q2\nq_total = 156.75 kJ + 1129.425 kJ\nq_total ≈ 1286.175 kJ\n\nSo, the amount of energy required to boil 500g of water starting from 25°C is approximately 1286.175 kJ."
