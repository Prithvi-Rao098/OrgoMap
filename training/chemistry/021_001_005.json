    "message_2": "In an oxygen molecule (O2), the type of bonding that exists between the two oxygen atoms is a covalent bond, specifically a double covalent bond. \n\nA covalent bond is formed when two atoms share electrons in order to achieve a stable electron configuration, typically by filling their valence (outer) electron shells. In the case of oxygen, each atom has 6 valence electrons and requires 2 more electrons to achieve a stable configuration with a full outer shell of 8 electrons. This is in accordance with the octet rule, which states that atoms tend to gain, lose, or share electrons to have a full set of 8 valence electrons.\n\nWhen two oxygen atoms bond together, they share two pairs of electrons, with each oxygen atom contributing two electrons. This results in a double covalent bond, as there are two pairs of shared electrons between the two oxygen atoms. The double bond ensures that both oxygen atoms have a full valence shell of 8 electrons, providing stability to the molecule.\n\nIn summary, the bonding between the atoms of an oxygen molecule is a double covalent bond, formed by the sharing of two pairs of electrons between the two oxygen atoms to achieve a stable electron configuration."
