    "message_2": "In H₂SO₄ (sulfuric acid), the oxidation state of sulfur can be determined by considering the oxidation states of the other elements in the compound and the overall charge of the molecule.\n\nHydrogen (H) has an oxidation state of +1, and there are two hydrogen atoms, so the total contribution from hydrogen is +2. Oxygen (O) has an oxidation state of -2, and there are four oxygen atoms, so the total contribution from oxygen is -8.\n\nThe overall charge of the molecule is neutral (0). Therefore, the oxidation state of sulfur (S) can be determined using the following equation:\n\nOxidation state of S + 2 (oxidation state of H) + 4 (oxidation state of O) = 0\n\nLet x be the oxidation state of sulfur (S). Then the equation becomes:\n\nx + 2(+1) + 4(-2) = 0\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx + 2 - 8 = 0\nx - 6 = 0\nx = +6\n\nSo, the oxidation state of sulfur in H₂SO₄ is +6."
