    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the acidic and basic components of the solution and their respective concentrations. HNO3 is a strong acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When they react, they will form water and a salt (NaNO3). The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nHNO3 + NaOH → H2O + NaNO3\n\nFirst, we need to determine the amount of moles of HNO3 and NaOH in the solution. Since the volume of the solution is not given, we can assume that it is the same for both components. \n\nMoles of HNO3 = 0.1 M\nMoles of NaOH = 0.05 M\n\nNow, we need to determine which component is in excess. Since there are more moles of HNO3 than NaOH, HNO3 is in excess, and NaOH is the limiting reactant. The reaction will consume all of the NaOH and some of the HNO3.\n\nMoles of HNO3 remaining after reaction = 0.1 M - 0.05 M = 0.05 M\n\nNow that we know the concentration of the remaining HNO3, we can calculate the pH of the solution. Since HNO3 is a strong acid, it will completely dissociate in water, and the concentration of H+ ions will be equal to the concentration of HNO3.\n\n[H+] = 0.05 M\n\nTo calculate the pH, we use the formula:\n\npH = -log10[H+]\n\npH = -log10(0.05)\n\npH ≈ 1.3\n\nThe predicted pH of the solution containing 0.1 M HNO3 and 0.05 M NaOH is approximately 1.3, which indicates that the solution is acidic."
