    "message_2": "To determine the weight of silver deposited on the cathode, we can use Faraday's law of electrolysis. First, we need to find the total charge passed through the solution.\n\nTotal charge (Q) = Current (I) × Time (t)\nGiven current (I) = 2 A and time (t) = 20 minutes = 20 × 60 seconds = 1200 seconds\n\nQ = 2 A × 1200 s = 2400 coulombs\n\nNow, we need to find the number of moles of electrons (n) passed through the solution using the Faraday constant (F).\n\nn = Q / F\nn = 2400 coulombs / 96,500 coulombs/mol = 0.02486 moles of electrons\n\nThe reaction at the cathode is:\nAg⁺ + e⁻ → Ag\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of silver ions (Ag⁺) requires 1 mole of electrons (e⁻) to deposit 1 mole of silver (Ag). Therefore, the number of moles of silver deposited is equal to the number of moles of electrons.\n\nMoles of silver deposited = 0.02486 moles\n\nNow, we can find the weight of silver deposited using the molar mass of silver (M_Ag = 107.87 g/mol).\n\nWeight of silver deposited = Moles of silver deposited × M_Ag\nWeight of silver deposited = 0.02486 moles × 107.87 g/mol = 2.681 g\n\nSo, the weight of silver deposited on the cathode is approximately 2.681 grams."
