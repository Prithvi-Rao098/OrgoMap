    "message_2": "Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a strong acid, which means it completely dissociates in water into hydrogen ions (H+) and chloride ions (Cl-). The concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution is equal to the concentration of the HCl.\n\nIn this case, the concentration of HCl is 0.05 M, so the concentration of H+ ions is also 0.05 M.\n\nTo calculate the pH of the solution, use the pH formula:\n\npH = -log10[H+]\n\nwhere [H+] is the concentration of hydrogen ions in moles per liter (M).\n\npH = -log10(0.05)\n\npH â‰ˆ 1.3\n\nThe pH of the solution containing 0.05 M hydrochloric acid is approximately 1.3."
