    "message_2": "Colorimetry is a technique used to determine the concentration of a colored compound in a solution by measuring the absorbance of light at a specific wavelength. In this case, we want to quantify the concentration of copper (II) ions in a water sample. To do this, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Prepare a series of copper (II) ion standards: Prepare a stock solution of known concentration of copper (II) sulfate (CuSO4). Then, create a series of standard solutions with varying concentrations of copper (II) ions by diluting the stock solution with distilled water. For example, you can prepare 5 standard solutions with concentrations of 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 ppm (parts per million).\n\n2. Complex formation: Copper (II) ions in solution are not very colorful and do not strongly absorb visible light. To enhance the color and improve the sensitivity of the measurement, we can form a complex with a suitable ligand. One common ligand used for this purpose is ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH). Add an equal volume of ammonium hydroxide to each standard solution and the water sample. This will form a deep blue complex called tetraamminecopper(II) complex [Cu(NH3)4(H2O)2]2+.\n\n3. Measure absorbance: Using a colorimeter or a spectrophotometer, measure the absorbance of each standard solution and the water sample at the wavelength of maximum absorbance for the tetraamminecopper(II) complex, which is around 635 nm.\n\n4. Calibration curve: Plot a graph of absorbance (y-axis) against the concentration of copper (II) ions in ppm (x-axis) for the standard solutions. The graph should be a straight line, and this is called the calibration curve.\n\n5. Determine the concentration of copper (II) ions in the water sample: Locate the absorbance value of the water sample on the y-axis of the calibration curve. Draw a horizontal line from this point to intersect the calibration curve, and then draw a vertical line from this intersection point down to the x-axis. The value on the x-axis where this vertical line intersects is the concentration of copper (II) ions in the water sample.\n\nBy following these steps, you can successfully quantify the concentration of copper (II) ions in a water sample using colorimetry."
