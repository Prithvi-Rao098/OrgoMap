    "message_2": "To calculate the heat of formation of methane (CH4), we need to consider the bond energies of the reactants and products involved in the formation of methane. The formation of methane can be represented by the following reaction:\n\nC (graphite) + 2 H2 (g) → CH4 (g)\n\nThe standard enthalpy of combustion of methane is given as -890.3 kJ/mol. This value corresponds to the reaction:\n\nCH4 (g) + 2 O2 (g) → CO2 (g) + 2 H2O (l)\n\nThe bond energies for the C-H and C-C bonds are given as 413 kJ/mol and 348 kJ/mol, respectively. However, we do not need the C-C bond energy for this calculation, as there are no C-C bonds involved in the formation of methane.\n\nTo calculate the heat of formation of methane, we need to consider the bond energies of the reactants and products. The bond energy of the C-H bond in methane is 413 kJ/mol, and there are four C-H bonds in one molecule of methane. Therefore, the total bond energy of the C-H bonds in methane is:\n\n4 × 413 kJ/mol = 1652 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we need to consider the bond energies of the reactants. The bond energy of the H-H bond in hydrogen gas (H2) is approximately 436 kJ/mol. Since there are two moles of hydrogen gas in the reaction, the total bond energy of the H-H bonds in the reactants is:\n\n2 × 436 kJ/mol = 872 kJ/mol\n\nThe heat of formation of methane can be calculated using the bond energies of the reactants and products:\n\nΔHf (CH4) = (Total bond energy of products) - (Total bond energy of reactants)\nΔHf (CH4) = (1652 kJ/mol) - (872 kJ/mol)\nΔHf (CH4) = 780 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the heat of formation of methane (CH4) is approximately 780 kJ/mol."
