    "message_1": "What would be the mass of p-nitroaniline produced when 5.00 g of aniline is reacted with excess nitric acid based on the balanced chemical equation for the synthesis reaction?",
    "message_2": "To determine the mass of p-nitroaniline produced, we first need the balanced chemical equation for the synthesis reaction:\n\nC6H7N + HNO3 → C6H6N2O2 + H2O\n\nThis equation tells us that 1 mole of aniline (C6H7N) reacts with 1 mole of nitric acid (HNO3) to produce 1 mole of p-nitroaniline (C6H6N2O2) and 1 mole of water (H2O).\n\nNext, we need to find the molar mass of aniline and p-nitroaniline:\n\nAniline (C6H7N): (6 × 12.01) + (7 × 1.01) + (1 × 14.01) = 93.13 g/mol\np-Nitroaniline (C6H6N2O2): (6 × 12.01) + (6 × 1.01) + (2 × 14.01) + (2 × 16.00) = 138.12 g/mol\n\nNow, we can use stoichiometry to find the mass of p-nitroaniline produced:\n\n5.00 g aniline × (1 mol aniline / 93.13 g aniline) × (1 mol p-nitroaniline / 1 mol aniline) × (138.12 g p-nitroaniline / 1 mol p-nitroaniline)\n\nThe units cancel out, leaving us with the mass of p-nitroaniline:\n\n5.00 g × (1 / 93.13) × (1 / 1) × (138.12 / 1) = 7.42 g\n\nSo, the mass of p-nitroaniline produced when 5.00 g of aniline is reacted with excess nitric acid is approximately 7.42 g."
