    "message_2": "In glucose (C6H12O6), the oxidation state of carbon can be determined by assigning oxidation numbers to each atom in the molecule. Oxygen has an oxidation number of -2, and hydrogen has an oxidation number of +1. \n\nTo calculate the oxidation state of carbon, we can use the formula:\n\nOxidation state of carbon (C) = (Total oxidation number of the molecule) - (Oxidation number of hydrogen atoms) - (Oxidation number of oxygen atoms)\n\nSince glucose is a neutral molecule, its total oxidation number is 0. There are 12 hydrogen atoms and 6 oxygen atoms in glucose. Therefore, the oxidation state of carbon can be calculated as:\n\nOxidation state of C = 0 - (12 x +1) - (6 x -2)\nOxidation state of C = 0 - 12 + 12\nOxidation state of C = 0\n\nSince there are 6 carbon atoms in glucose, the average oxidation state of each carbon atom is 0.\n\nDuring glycolysis, glucose is converted into two molecules of pyruvate (C3H4O3). In pyruvate, the oxidation state of carbon can be calculated using the same formula:\n\nOxidation state of C = (Total oxidation number of the molecule) - (Oxidation number of hydrogen atoms) - (Oxidation number of oxygen atoms)\n\nFor pyruvate, the total oxidation number is 0, there are 4 hydrogen atoms, and 3 oxygen atoms. Therefore, the oxidation state of carbon can be calculated as:\n\nOxidation state of C = 0 - (4 x +1) - (3 x -2)\nOxidation state of C = 0 - 4 + 6\nOxidation state of C = +2\n\nSince there are 3 carbon atoms in pyruvate, the average oxidation state of each carbon atom is +2/3.\n\nDuring glycolysis, the oxidation state of carbon in glucose changes from an average of 0 to an average of +2/3 in pyruvate. This indicates that the carbon atoms in glucose are oxidized during glycolysis."
