    "message_2": "The preparation of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline from aniline and chlorine gas involves a two-step process. First, aniline is nitrated to form 4-nitroaniline, and then it is chlorinated to form 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline.\n\n1. Nitration of aniline:\nThe optimum temperature for nitration is around 0-5째C. This is because aniline is highly reactive, and lower temperatures help control the reaction and prevent over-nitration. The reaction time for this step is typically 1-2 hours.\n\n2. Chlorination of 4-nitroaniline:\nThe chlorination step is usually carried out at a temperature of 40-60째C to ensure a high yield of the desired product. The reaction time for this step is typically 3-4 hours.\n\nIn summary, to prepare 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline from aniline and chlorine gas with a high yield, the nitration step should be performed at 0-5째C for 1-2 hours, followed by the chlorination step at 40-60째C for 3-4 hours."
