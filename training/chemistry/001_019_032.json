    "message_2": "The reaction between chloroethane (CH3CH2Cl) and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is a nucleophilic substitution reaction, specifically an SN2 reaction. In this reaction, the hydroxide ion (OH-) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon atom in chloroethane, leading to the substitution of the chlorine atom with the hydroxide ion.\n\nBalanced equation:\nCH3CH2Cl + NaOH â†’ CH3CH2OH + NaCl\n\nSteps involved:\n1. The hydroxide ion (OH-) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon atom in chloroethane, which is bonded to the chlorine atom.\n2. The carbon-chlorine bond starts to break as the carbon-oxygen bond begins to form. This occurs in a single concerted step, which is characteristic of an SN2 reaction.\n3. The chlorine atom leaves as a chloride ion (Cl-), and the hydroxide ion has now replaced the chlorine atom, forming ethanol (CH3CH2OH).\n\nProducts formed:\n1. Ethanol (CH3CH2OH)\n2. Sodium chloride (NaCl)"
