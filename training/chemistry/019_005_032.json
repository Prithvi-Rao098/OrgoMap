    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG = ΔH - TΔS\n\nwhere ΔH is the standard enthalpy change of reaction, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ΔS is the standard entropy change of reaction.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin:\n\nT = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\n\nNext, we need to convert the standard entropy change of reaction from J/K·mol to kJ/K·mol:\n\nΔS = -163.2 J/K·mol × (1 kJ / 1000 J) = -0.1632 kJ/K·mol\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the equation:\n\nΔG = (-483.6 kJ/mol) - (298.15 K × -0.1632 kJ/K·mol)\n\nΔG = -483.6 kJ/mol + 48.7 kJ/mol\n\nΔG = -434.9 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the Gibbs free energy change for the reaction at 25°C is -434.9 kJ/mol."
