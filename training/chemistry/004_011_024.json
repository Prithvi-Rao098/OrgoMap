    "message_2": "To determine the molecular structure of the unknown compound X, we need to analyze the given proton NMR spectroscopy data:\n\n1. Chemical shift at 2.8 ppm (2H, triplet): This signal indicates the presence of two protons (2H) that are likely adjacent to a CH2 group (hence the triplet). The chemical shift value of 2.8 ppm suggests that these protons are attached to a carbon atom that is connected to an electronegative atom, such as oxygen or nitrogen.\n\n2. Chemical shift at 4.1 ppm (2H, singlet): This signal represents two protons (2H) that are not coupled to any neighboring protons (hence the singlet). The chemical shift value of 4.1 ppm suggests that these protons are part of a CH2 group that is directly attached to an electronegative atom, such as oxygen or nitrogen.\n\n3. Chemical shift at 7.2 ppm (4H, multiplet): This signal indicates the presence of four protons (4H) that are likely part of an aromatic ring system, as the chemical shift value of 7.2 ppm is typical for aromatic protons. The multiplet pattern suggests that these protons are not equivalent and may be part of a substituted aromatic ring.\n\nBased on this information, a possible molecular structure for compound X is an aromatic ring (such as a benzene ring) with a CH2 group attached to an electronegative atom (such as oxygen or nitrogen) and another CH2 group adjacent to the first CH2 group. One possible structure is an ethyl ester or ethyl amide derivative of a substituted benzene ring, such as:\n\nO\n||\nC-O-CH2-CH2-Ar\n\nor\n\nO\n||\nC-NH-CH2-CH2-Ar\n\nwhere \"Ar\" represents the substituted aromatic ring. Further analysis, such as carbon NMR or mass spectrometry, would be required to confirm the exact structure of the unknown compound X."
