    "message_2": "To find the density of sodium chloride (NaCl) at 25°C, we can use the formula:\n\nDensity = Mass / Volume\n\nGiven the mass of NaCl is 108 g and its volume is 75 mL, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nDensity = 108 g / 75 mL\n\nDensity = 1.44 g/mL\n\nSo, the density of sodium chloride (NaCl) at 25°C is 1.44 g/mL."
