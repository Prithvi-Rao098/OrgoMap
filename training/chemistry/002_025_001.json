    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic moment of a tetrahedral complex [MnCl4]2-, we first need to find the oxidation state of the manganese (Mn) ion and the number of unpaired electrons.\n\nManganese (Mn) is a transition metal, and its oxidation state in this complex can be determined by considering the charge of the ligands. Chloride (Cl-) has a charge of -1, and there are four chloride ions in the complex. The overall charge of the complex is -2. Therefore, the oxidation state of Mn in this complex is:\n\nMn + 4(-1) = -2\nMn = +2\n\nNow that we know the oxidation state of Mn is +2, we can determine the electron configuration. The atomic number of Mn is 25, and its electron configuration is [Ar] 3d5 4s2. In the Mn(II) oxidation state, Mn loses two electrons, which are removed from the 4s orbital first, resulting in the following electron configuration:\n\nMn(II): [Ar] 3d5\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of unpaired electrons in the 3d orbitals. In the case of Mn(II), there are five 3d electrons, and all of them are unpaired.\n\nThe magnetic moment (μ) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nμ = √(n(n+2))\n\nwhere n is the number of unpaired electrons. In this case, n = 5.\n\nμ = √(5(5+2))\nμ = √(5(7))\nμ = √35\n\nThe magnetic moment of the tetrahedral complex [MnCl4]2- is approximately √35 Bohr magnetons (BM)."
