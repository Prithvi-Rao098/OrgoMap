    "message_1": "What is the standard free energy change for the following redox reaction at 25°C?\n\n2Fe3+(aq) + Sn2+(aq) → 2Fe2+(aq) + Sn4+(aq) \n\nGiven: \n\nE°(Fe3+/Fe2+) = 0.771 V \n\nE°(Sn4+/Sn2+) = 0.150 V \n\nR = 8.314 J/K•mol \n\nF = 96,485 C/mol",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard free energy change (ΔG°) for the redox reaction, we first need to determine the standard cell potential (E°cell) for the reaction. This can be done using the Nernst equation:\n\nE°cell = E°(cathode) - E°(anode)\n\nIn this reaction, Fe3+ is reduced to Fe2+ (cathode) and Sn2+ is oxidized to Sn4+ (anode). Therefore, we can plug in the given values:\n\nE°cell = 0.771 V - 0.150 V = 0.621 V\n\nNow, we can use the relationship between the standard cell potential and the standard free energy change:\n\nΔG° = -nFE°cell\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the reaction, F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol), and E°cell is the standard cell potential.\n\nIn this reaction, 2 moles of electrons are transferred (from Sn2+ to Fe3+). So, n = 2.\n\nΔG° = -2 * 96,485 C/mol * 0.621 V\n\nΔG° = -119,923.77 J/mol\n\nSince 1 V = 1 J/C, the units are consistent, and the standard free energy change for the reaction at 25°C is:\n\nΔG° ≈ -119,924 J/mol"
