    "message_2": "The specific amino acid residues involved in the recognition and binding of carbohydrates to proteins are mainly found in carbohydrate-binding proteins, also known as lectins. These amino acids play a crucial role in the interaction between the protein and the carbohydrate, forming hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and van der Waals forces. Some of the key amino acid residues involved in carbohydrate recognition and binding include:\n\n1. Tryptophan (Trp): Tryptophan residues are often found in carbohydrate-binding sites due to their ability to form stacking interactions with the sugar rings, providing stability to the protein-carbohydrate complex.\n\n2. Asparagine (Asn): Asparagine residues can form hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups of carbohydrates, contributing to the specificity and affinity of the binding interaction.\n\n3. Glutamine (Gln): Similar to asparagine, glutamine residues can also form hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups of carbohydrates, playing a role in the recognition and binding process.\n\n4. Histidine (His): Histidine residues can participate in hydrogen bonding and coordinate with metal ions, which can be important for the binding of carbohydrates to certain lectins.\n\n5. Arginine (Arg): Arginine residues can form multiple hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups and negatively charged groups of carbohydrates, contributing to the specificity and affinity of the binding interaction.\n\n6. Lysine (Lys): Lysine residues can form hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions with negatively charged groups of carbohydrates, playing a role in the recognition and binding process.\n\n7. Serine (Ser) and Threonine (Thr): These amino acids have hydroxyl groups in their side chains, which can form hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups of carbohydrates, contributing to the binding interaction.\n\n8. Tyrosine (Tyr): Tyrosine residues can form hydrogen bonds and stacking interactions with the sugar rings, providing stability to the protein-carbohydrate complex.\n\nThese amino acid residues can be found in various combinations and arrangements in the carbohydrate-binding sites of lectins, contributing to the diverse specificities and affinities observed in protein-carbohydrate interactions. The exact residues involved in carbohydrate recognition and binding may vary depending on the specific lectin and carbohydrate involved."
