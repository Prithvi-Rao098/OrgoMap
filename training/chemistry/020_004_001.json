    "message_2": "The addition of a catalyst to a chemical reaction does not affect the equilibrium position of the reaction. A catalyst works by lowering the activation energy of the reaction, which increases the rate at which the reaction proceeds in both the forward and reverse directions. However, the equilibrium constant (K) remains unchanged, as it is only affected by temperature.\n\nTo demonstrate this, let's consider the reaction:\n\nA + B ⇌ C + D\n\nThe equilibrium constant (K) for this reaction can be expressed as:\n\nK = [C][D] / [A][B]\n\nwhere [A], [B], [C], and [D] represent the concentrations of the respective species at equilibrium.\n\nNow, let's assume we add a catalyst to the reaction. The catalyst will increase the rate of the forward reaction (k1) and the reverse reaction (k2) by the same factor. This means that the ratio of the rate constants remains the same:\n\nk1 / k2 = k1' / k2'\n\nwhere k1 and k2 are the rate constants without the catalyst, and k1' and k2' are the rate constants with the catalyst.\n\nSince the equilibrium constant (K) is defined as the ratio of the rate constants:\n\nK = k1 / k2\n\nand because the ratio of the rate constants remains the same with the addition of the catalyst:\n\nK = k1' / k2'\n\nThus, the equilibrium constant (K) and the equilibrium position remain unchanged when a catalyst is added to the reaction. The only effect of the catalyst is to increase the rate at which the reaction reaches equilibrium, but it does not change the equilibrium concentrations of the reactants and products."
