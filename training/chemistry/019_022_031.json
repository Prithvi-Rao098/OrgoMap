    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the reaction, we need to use the following formula:\n\nΔH° = Σ ΔH°f(products) - Σ ΔH°f(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH°f represents the standard enthalpy of formation of each substance.\n\nFirst, let's write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nC2H5OH (l) + 3 O2 (g) → 2 CO2 (g) + 3 H2O (l)\n\nNow, we need the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔH°f) for each substance:\n\nΔH°f (C2H5OH, l) = -277.7 kJ/mol\nΔH°f (O2, g) = 0 kJ/mol (since O2 is in its standard state)\nΔH°f (CO2, g) = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔH°f (H2O, l) = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nΔH° = [2 × (-393.5) + 3 × (-285.8)] - [-277.7 + 3 × 0]\nΔH° = [-787 + (-857.4)] - (-277.7)\nΔH° = -1644.4 + 277.7\nΔH° = -1366.7 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the reaction is -1366.7 kJ/mol."
