    "message_1": "What is the reaction quotient Qc for the following equilibrium reaction at 25°C, given the molar concentrations of the reactants and products:\n2NO2(g) ⇌ 2NO(g) + O2(g)\n[NO] = 0.50 M, [O2] = 0.25 M, and [NO2] = 0.75 M.",
    "message_2": "The reaction quotient Qc is calculated using the molar concentrations of the reactants and products raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients. For the given reaction:\n\n2NO2(g) ⇌ 2NO(g) + O2(g)\n\nThe expression for Qc is:\n\nQc = ([NO]^2 * [O2]) / [NO2]^2\n\nGiven the molar concentrations: [NO] = 0.50 M, [O2] = 0.25 M, and [NO2] = 0.75 M, we can plug these values into the Qc expression:\n\nQc = ((0.50)^2 * (0.25)) / (0.75)^2\n\nQc = (0.25 * 0.25) / 0.5625\n\nQc = 0.0625 / 0.5625\n\nQc ≈ 0.111\n\nSo, the reaction quotient Qc for the given equilibrium reaction at 25°C is approximately 0.111."
