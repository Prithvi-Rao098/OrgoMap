    "message_2": "To determine the amount of ethylene oxide needed to synthesize 100 grams of polyethylene oxide with a molecular weight of 200,000 g/mol, we first need to find the molecular weight of ethylene oxide. The molecular weight of ethylene oxide (C2H4O) is:\n\nC: 12.01 g/mol (2 atoms) = 24.02 g/mol\nH: 1.01 g/mol (4 atoms) = 4.04 g/mol\nO: 16.00 g/mol (1 atom) = 16.00 g/mol\n\nTotal molecular weight of ethylene oxide = 24.02 + 4.04 + 16.00 = 44.06 g/mol\n\nNow, we need to find the number of moles of polyethylene oxide in 100 grams:\n\nmoles of polyethylene oxide = mass / molecular weight\nmoles of polyethylene oxide = 100 g / 200,000 g/mol = 0.0005 moles\n\nSince the reaction is 1:1 (1 mole of ethylene oxide produces 1 mole of polyethylene oxide), we need the same number of moles of ethylene oxide:\n\nmoles of ethylene oxide = 0.0005 moles\n\nNow, we can find the mass of ethylene oxide needed:\n\nmass of ethylene oxide = moles * molecular weight\nmass of ethylene oxide = 0.0005 moles * 44.06 g/mol = 0.02203 g\n\nHowever, the reaction has an 80% yield, so we need to account for this:\n\nmass of ethylene oxide needed = 0.02203 g / 0.80 = 0.02754 g\n\nSo, 0.02754 grams of ethylene oxide is needed to synthesize 100 grams of polyethylene oxide with a molecular weight of 200,000 g/mol.\n\nNow, to find the amount of polyethylene oxide obtained with an 80% yield:\n\nmass of polyethylene oxide obtained = 100 g * 0.80 = 80 g\n\nTherefore, 80 grams of polyethylene oxide will be obtained with an 80% yield."
