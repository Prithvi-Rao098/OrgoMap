    "message_2": "To calculate the final temperature, we can use the formula:\n\nQ_lost = Q_gained\n\nwhere Q is the heat energy, and the heat lost by the aluminum will be equal to the heat gained by the water.\n\nFor aluminum, the heat lost can be calculated using the formula:\n\nQ_Al = m_Al × c_Al × (T_initial_Al - T_final)\n\nwhere m_Al is the mass of aluminum (25 g), c_Al is the specific heat capacity of aluminum (0.90 J/g°C), T_initial_Al is the initial temperature of aluminum (80°C), and T_final is the final temperature.\n\nFor water, the heat gained can be calculated using the formula:\n\nQ_water = m_water × c_water × (T_final - T_initial_water)\n\nwhere m_water is the mass of water (100 g), c_water is the specific heat capacity of water (4.18 J/g°C), T_initial_water is the initial temperature of water (25°C), and T_final is the final temperature.\n\nNow, we can set the heat lost by aluminum equal to the heat gained by water:\n\nm_Al × c_Al × (T_initial_Al - T_final) = m_water × c_water × (T_final - T_initial_water)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n25 g × 0.90 J/g°C × (80°C - T_final) = 100 g × 4.18 J/g°C × (T_final - 25°C)\n\nSolving for T_final:\n\n22.5 × (80 - T_final) = 418 × (T_final - 25)\n\n1800 - 22.5 × T_final = 418 × T_final - 10450\n\n1800 + 10450 = 22.5 × T_final + 418 × T_final\n\n11250 = 440.5 × T_final\n\nT_final = 11250 / 440.5\n\nT_final ≈ 25.54°C\n\nSo, the final temperature when 25 grams of aluminum at 80°C is placed in 100 grams of water at 25°C is approximately 25.54°C."
