    "message_1": "What is the efficiency of an electrochemical cell composed of a zinc electrode and a copper electrode, with a salt bridge made of potassium chloride and a 1 M zinc sulfate solution and a 1 M copper sulfate solution? The standard reduction potentials of zinc and copper electrodes are -0.76 V and +0.34 V, respectively. The measured voltage of the cell is 1.1 V. Calculate the cell's efficiency.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the efficiency of the electrochemical cell, we first need to determine the theoretical cell potential (E°cell) using the standard reduction potentials of the zinc and copper electrodes. The cell potential can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nE°cell = E°cathode - E°anode\n\nIn this case, the copper electrode is the cathode, and the zinc electrode is the anode. So, we can plug in the standard reduction potentials:\n\nE°cell = (+0.34 V) - (-0.76 V) = 1.10 V\n\nNow that we have the theoretical cell potential, we can compare it to the measured cell potential to determine the efficiency. The efficiency of the cell can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nEfficiency = (Measured cell potential / Theoretical cell potential) × 100%\n\nEfficiency = (1.1 V / 1.1 V) × 100% = 100%\n\nThe efficiency of the electrochemical cell is 100%."
