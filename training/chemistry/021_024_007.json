    "message_2": "To calculate the bond order of the N2 molecule using molecular orbital theory, a student should follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the total number of valence electrons in the N2 molecule. Nitrogen has 5 valence electrons, and since there are two nitrogen atoms, the total number of valence electrons is 10.\n\n2. Fill the molecular orbitals according to the Aufbau principle, which states that orbitals are filled in order of increasing energy. For diatomic molecules like N2, the order of molecular orbitals is: σ1s, σ*1s, σ2s, σ*2s, π2p (x and y), σ2p, π*2p (x and y), and σ*2p. \n\n3. Distribute the 10 valence electrons among the molecular orbitals. The distribution will be as follows:\n   - 2 electrons in σ1s\n   - 2 electrons in σ*1s\n   - 2 electrons in σ2s\n   - 2 electrons in σ*2s\n   - 2 electrons in π2p (x and y)\n\n4. Calculate the bond order using the formula: Bond order = (number of electrons in bonding orbitals - number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\n   In this case, there are 8 electrons in bonding orbitals (σ1s, σ2s, and π2p) and 4 electrons in antibonding orbitals (σ*1s and σ*2s). So, the bond order is (8 - 4) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2.\n\nThe calculated bond order of 2 indicates that the nitrogen-nitrogen bond in the N2 molecule is a double bond. A higher bond order generally corresponds to a stronger and more stable bond. In the case of N2, the bond is quite strong and stable, which is why nitrogen gas is relatively unreactive under normal conditions."
