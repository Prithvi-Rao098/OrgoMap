    "message_2": "To find the amount of heat released, we first need to determine the number of moles of methane (CH4) in 2.5 grams. The molar mass of CH4 is 12.01 g/mol (C) + 4 * 1.01 g/mol (H) = 16.05 g/mol.\n\nNow, we can find the number of moles of CH4:\nmoles of CH4 = (mass of CH4) / (molar mass of CH4)\nmoles of CH4 = 2.5 g / 16.05 g/mol = 0.1558 mol\n\nThe balanced thermochemical equation tells us that 1 mole of CH4 releases 890.4 kJ of heat when it reacts with excess oxygen. So, we can find the heat released by 0.1558 moles of CH4:\n\nHeat released = (moles of CH4) * (ΔH° per mole)\nHeat released = 0.1558 mol * (-890.4 kJ/mol) = -138.7 kJ\n\nTherefore, the amount of heat released when 2.5 grams of methane react with excess oxygen is approximately -138.7 kJ. The negative sign indicates that the reaction is exothermic, meaning heat is released."
