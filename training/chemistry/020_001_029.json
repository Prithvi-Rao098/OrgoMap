    "message_2": "To determine the equilibrium constant Kc, we first need to find the change in concentration for each species during the reaction. We can do this by setting up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:\n\n```\n          N2(g)   O2(g)   2NO(g)\nInitial:  0.50    0.40    0.00\nChange:  -x       -x      +2x\nEquilibrium: 0.50-x  0.40-x  0.10+2x\n```\n\nWe are given the equilibrium concentrations of N2, O2, and NO. We can use these values to solve for x:\n\n0.50 - x = 0.50 (no change in N2 concentration)\nx = 0\n\n0.40 - x = 0.40 (no change in O2 concentration)\nx = 0\n\n0.10 + 2x = 0.10 (equilibrium concentration of NO)\n2x = 0\nx = 0\n\nSince there is no change in the concentrations of the reactants and products, the reaction has not proceeded. Therefore, the equilibrium constant Kc is 1, as the reaction is at equilibrium with no change in concentrations:\n\nKc = [NO]^2 / ([N2] * [O2])\nKc = (0.10)^2 / (0.50 * 0.40)\nKc = 0.01 / 0.20\nKc = 0.05\n\nThe equilibrium constant Kc for the given reaction is 0.05."
