    "message_1": "What is the predicted change in the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g) when the temperature is increased from 300 K to 400 K? Given that the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the reaction is -92.38 kJ/mol and the standard entropy change (ΔS°) is 192.45 J/mol•K. Assume that ΔH° and ΔS° do not change with temperature.",
    "message_2": "To determine the change in the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction when the temperature is increased from 300 K to 400 K, we can use the van't Hoff equation:\n\nln(K2/K1) = -ΔH°/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere K1 and K2 are the equilibrium constants at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively, ΔH° is the standard enthalpy change, and R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol•K).\n\nFirst, we need to convert ΔH° from kJ/mol to J/mol:\n\nΔH° = -92.38 kJ/mol * (1000 J/1 kJ) = -92380 J/mol\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the van't Hoff equation:\n\nln(K2/K1) = -(-92380 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol•K) * (1/400 K - 1/300 K)\n\nln(K2/K1) = 92380 / 8.314 * (0.0025 - 0.003333)\n\nln(K2/K1) ≈ 11.116 * (-0.000833)\n\nln(K2/K1) ≈ -9.25\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of K2 to K1:\n\nK2/K1 = e^(-9.25) ≈ 9.54 x 10^(-5)\n\nSince we don't have the initial value of K1, we cannot determine the exact values of K2 and K1. However, we can predict the change in the equilibrium constant. The equilibrium constant Kc decreases when the temperature is increased from 300 K to 400 K for this reaction. This is consistent with Le Chatelier's principle, as the reaction is exothermic (ΔH° < 0), and increasing the temperature will shift the equilibrium towards the reactants, resulting in a lower value of Kc."
