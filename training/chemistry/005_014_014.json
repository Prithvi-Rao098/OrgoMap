    "message_2": "During glycolysis, the net gain of ATP is 2 ATP molecules per glucose molecule. Glycolysis is a series of biochemical reactions that break down one glucose molecule (6 carbons) into two molecules of pyruvate (3 carbons each). The process occurs in the cytoplasm of cells and does not require oxygen.\n\nThe generation of ATP in glycolysis occurs in two main steps:\n\n1. Energy investment phase: In this phase, 2 ATP molecules are consumed to phosphorylate glucose and its intermediate, fructose-6-phosphate. This results in the formation of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, which is then split into two 3-carbon molecules, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP). DHAP is converted into G3P, so there are two G3P molecules entering the next phase.\n\n2. Energy payoff phase: In this phase, each G3P molecule undergoes a series of reactions that generate ATP and NADH. First, G3P is oxidized, and inorganic phosphate (Pi) is added to form 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. During this reaction, NAD+ is reduced to NADH. Then, a high-energy phosphate group is transferred from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to ADP, forming ATP and 3-phosphoglycerate. This process is called substrate-level phosphorylation. Finally, the remaining reactions convert 3-phosphoglycerate to pyruvate.\n\nSince there are two G3P molecules entering the energy payoff phase, a total of 4 ATP molecules are generated (2 ATP per G3P). However, considering the 2 ATP molecules consumed in the energy investment phase, the net gain of ATP during glycolysis is 2 ATP molecules per glucose molecule."
