The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is: AgNO3(aq) + NaCl(aq) --> AgCl(s) + NaNO3(aq). Assume that the reaction occurs at standard conditions of temperature and pressure (STP).",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the precipitation reaction, we need to know the standard enthalpies of formation for each of the compounds involved in the reaction. The standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) is the change in enthalpy when 1 mole of a compound is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states.\n\nThe standard enthalpies of formation for the compounds involved in the reaction are as follows:\n\nΔHf°(AgNO3) = -124.4 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(NaCl) = -411.1 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(AgCl) = -127.0 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(NaNO3) = -365.6 kJ/mol\n\nUsing Hess's Law, the standard enthalpy change for the reaction (ΔHr°) can be calculated as follows:\n\nΔHr° = [ΔHf°(products) - ΔHf°(reactants)]\n\nΔHr° = [(-127.0 kJ/mol + (-365.6 kJ/mol)) - (-124.4 kJ/mol + (-411.1 kJ/mol))]\n\nΔHr° = [(-492.6 kJ/mol) - (-535.5 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔHr° = 42.9 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of moles of AgNO3 and NaCl in the reaction:\n\nmoles of AgNO3 = (0.100 mol/L) * (0.050 L) = 0.005 mol\nmoles of NaCl = (0.100 mol/L) * (0.050 L) = 0.005 mol\n\nSince the reaction is a 1:1 stoichiometry, both reactants will be completely consumed in the reaction. Therefore, we can calculate the total enthalpy change for the reaction by multiplying the standard enthalpy change per mole by the number of moles of reactants:\n\nTotal enthalpy change = (42.9 kJ/mol) * (0.005 mol) = 0.2145 kJ\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the precipitation reaction that occurs when 50.0 mL of 0.100 M AgNO3 solution is added to 50.0 mL of 0.100 M NaCl solution is 0.2145 kJ."
