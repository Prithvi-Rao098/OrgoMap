    "message_2": "To calculate the total heat absorbed, we need to consider three steps:\n\n1. Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C\n2. Melting the ice at 0°C\n3. Heating the water from 0°C to 35°C\n\nStep 1: Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C\nq1 = mass x specific heat of ice x ΔT\nSpecific heat of ice = 2.09 J/g°C (approximately)\nΔT = 0°C - (-10°C) = 10°C\nmass = 32 g\n\nq1 = 32 g x 2.09 J/g°C x 10°C = 669.6 J\n\nStep 2: Melting the ice at 0°C\nq2 = moles x enthalpy of fusion\nMolar mass of ice (H2O) = 18.015 g/mol\nEnthalpy of fusion = 6.01 kJ/mol = 6010 J/mol\n\nmoles = 32 g / 18.015 g/mol = 1.776 mol\n\nq2 = 1.776 mol x 6010 J/mol = 10677.6 J\n\nStep 3: Heating the water from 0°C to 35°C\nq3 = mass x specific heat of water x ΔT\nSpecific heat of water = 4.18 J/g°C\nΔT = 35°C - 0°C = 35°C\nmass = 32 g\n\nq3 = 32 g x 4.18 J/g°C x 35°C = 4697.6 J\n\nTotal heat absorbed (q_total) = q1 + q2 + q3\nq_total = 669.6 J + 10677.6 J + 4697.6 J = 16044.8 J\n\nThe amount of heat absorbed when 32 grams of ice at -10°C melts into water and then further heated to 35°C is 16,044.8 J."
