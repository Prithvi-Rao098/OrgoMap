    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of energy required to vaporize 50 grams of water at its normal boiling point, we need to first determine the number of moles of water present and then use the enthalpy of vaporization to find the energy required.\n\n1. Calculate the number of moles of water:\nThe molecular weight of water (H2O) is 18.015 g/mol (1.008 g/mol for hydrogen and 15.999 g/mol for oxygen). \n\nNumber of moles = mass / molecular weight\nNumber of moles = 50 g / 18.015 g/mol = 2.775 moles\n\n2. Calculate the energy required using the enthalpy of vaporization:\nEnergy required = number of moles × enthalpy of vaporization\nEnergy required = 2.775 moles × 40.7 kJ/mol = 112.9425 kJ\n\nTherefore, the amount of energy required to vaporize 50 grams of water at its normal boiling point is approximately 112.94 kJ."
