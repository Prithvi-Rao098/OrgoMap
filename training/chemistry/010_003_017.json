    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the reaction, we first need to determine the overall cell potential (E°) for the redox reaction using the standard reduction potentials for each half-reaction.\n\nThe half-reactions are:\n\n1. Oxidation of Zinc: Zn(s) → Zn²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻\nStandard reduction potential (E°₁) = -0.76 V\n\n2. Reduction of Copper ions: Cu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Cu(s)\nStandard reduction potential (E°₂) = +0.34 V\n\nSince the Zinc is being oxidized, we need to reverse the sign of its standard reduction potential. The overall cell potential (E°) is the sum of the standard reduction potentials for the two half-reactions:\n\nE° = E°₂ - E°₁ = (+0.34 V) - (-0.76 V) = +1.10 V\n\nNow, we can calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) using the formula:\n\nΔG = -nFE°\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of electrons transferred (in this case, 2 moles of electrons), F is the Faraday constant (approximately 96,485 C/mol), and E° is the overall cell potential.\n\nΔG = -2 mol × 96,485 C/mol × 1.10 V\nΔG = -212,267 J/mol\n\nThe Gibbs free energy change for the reaction of Zinc with Copper sulfate solution is -212,267 J/mol."
