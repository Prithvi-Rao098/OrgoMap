    "message_2": "To find the enthalpy change for the reaction between sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and hydrochloric acid (HCl), we can use Hess's Law. Hess's Law states that the enthalpy change for a reaction is the same, whether it occurs in one step or several steps. In this case, we are given two reactions:\n\n1) NaOH + KOH → products (ΔH1 = -57.2 kJ/mol)\n2) KOH + HCl → products (ΔH2 = -57.3 kJ/mol)\n\nWe want to find the enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\n3) NaOH + HCl → products (ΔH3)\n\nTo do this, we can manipulate the given reactions to create the desired reaction. In this case, we can reverse reaction 1 and add it to reaction 2:\n\n1) NaOH + KOH → products (ΔH1 = -57.2 kJ/mol)\nReverse: products → NaOH + KOH (ΔH1' = +57.2 kJ/mol)\n\nAdd reversed reaction 1 to reaction 2:\n\nΔH1' + ΔH2 = ΔH3\n(+57.2 kJ/mol) + (-57.3 kJ/mol) = ΔH3\n\nΔH3 = -0.1 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the enthalpy change for the reaction between sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) is -0.1 kJ/mol."
