    "message_1": "What is the Gibbs free energy change for the electrochemical reaction that occurs when the following cell is set up: \n\nHg2Cl2(s) | Hg(l) || Cl2(g) | Pt(s) \n\nGiven: \nStandard reduction potential of Hg2Cl2(l)/Hg(l) is -0.268V \nStandard reduction potential of Cl2(g)/Cl-(aq) is +1.36 V",
    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the electrochemical reaction, we first need to determine the overall cell potential (E_cell). The cell potential can be calculated using the standard reduction potentials given:\n\nE_cell = E_cathode - E_anode\n\nIn this case, the reduction of Cl2(g) to Cl-(aq) is the cathode reaction, and the oxidation of Hg2Cl2(l) to Hg(l) is the anode reaction. Using the given standard reduction potentials:\n\nE_cell = (+1.36 V) - (-0.268 V) = 1.628 V\n\nNow, we can calculate the Gibbs free energy change using the formula:\n\nΔG = -nFE_cell\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the reaction, F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol), and E_cell is the cell potential.\n\nFor the reaction, the balanced half-reactions are:\n\nHg2Cl2(l) + 2e- → 2Hg(l) + 2Cl-(aq) (anode)\nCl2(g) + 2e- → 2Cl-(aq) (cathode)\n\nBoth half-reactions involve the transfer of 2 moles of electrons, so n = 2.\n\nNow, we can calculate the Gibbs free energy change:\n\nΔG = -(2 mol)(96,485 C/mol)(1.628 V) = -314,596 J/mol\n\nThe Gibbs free energy change for the electrochemical reaction is -314,596 J/mol."
