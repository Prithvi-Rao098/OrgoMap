    "message_2": "The photochemical behavior of two enantiomers of a chiral molecule can differ significantly due to their distinct spatial arrangements, which can lead to different interactions with light and other molecules. This phenomenon is known as \"chiroptical properties\" and can result in different absorption, emission, and reaction rates for each enantiomer.\n\nA specific example of this difference in photochemical properties can be observed in the enantiomers of limonene, a chiral molecule found in citrus fruits. Limonene has two enantiomers: R-limonene and S-limonene. R-limonene has a pleasant orange scent, while S-limonene has a more pine-like scent. These enantiomers have different photochemical properties,"
