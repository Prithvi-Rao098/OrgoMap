The equilibrium concentrations of SO2 and SO3 are both 0.05 M. Assume the reaction takes place in a closed system at constant pressure.\"",
    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction, we first need to determine the change in concentrations of each species during the reaction. Since the reaction is balanced, we can use stoichiometry to find the changes in concentrations.\n\nInitial concentrations:\n[SO2] = 0.1 M\n[O2] = 0.2 M\n[SO3] = 0 M\n\nEquilibrium concentrations:\n[SO2] = 0.05 M\n[O2] = ?\n[SO3] = 0.05 M\n\nChange in concentrations:\nΔ[SO2] = -0.05 M (since it is a reactant)\nΔ[O2] = ?\nΔ[SO3] = +0.05 M (since it is a product)\n\nFrom the stoichiometry of the balanced reaction, we can see that 2 moles of SO2 react with 1 mole of O2 to produce 2 moles of SO3. Therefore, the change in concentration of O2 is half the change in concentration of SO2:\n\nΔ[O2] = (1/2) * Δ[SO2] = (1/2) * (-0.05 M) = -0.025 M\n\nNow we can find the equilibrium concentration of O2:\n\n[O2] = initial concentration + change in concentration\n[O2] = 0.2 M + (-0.025 M) = 0.175 M\n\nNow that we have the equilibrium concentrations of all species, we can calculate the equilibrium constant (Kc) using the expression:\n\nKc = [SO3]^2 / ([SO2]^2 * [O2])\n\nPlugging in the equilibrium concentrations:\n\nKc = (0.05)^2 / ((0.05)^2 * (0.175))\nKc = 0.0025 / (0.0025 * 0.175)\nKc = 0.0025 / 0.0004375\nKc ≈ 5.71\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction is approximately 5.71."
