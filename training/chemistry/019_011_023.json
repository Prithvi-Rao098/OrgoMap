    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the formation of methane gas (CH4) from its elements, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔHf° (CH4) = Σ ΔHf° (products) - Σ ΔHf° (reactants)\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the formation of methane is:\n\nC(graphite) + 2H2(g) → CH4(g)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nΔHf° (CH4) = [ΔHf° (CH4)] - [ΔHf° (C(graphite)) + 2 * ΔHf° (H2(g))]\n\nSince ΔHf° (C(graphite)) and ΔHf° (H2(g)) are both 0 kJ/mol, the equation simplifies to:\n\nΔHf° (CH4) = [ΔHf° (CH4)] - [0 + 2 * 0]\n\nWe are given the value of ΔHc° (CH4) which is -890.4 kJ/mol. The enthalpy of combustion (ΔHc°) is the enthalpy change when one mole of a substance is completely burned in oxygen. In this case, we are given the enthalpy of combustion for methane, which is the reverse reaction of the formation of methane.\n\nThe enthalpy change for the reverse reaction is the negative of the enthalpy change for the forward reaction. Therefore, the enthalpy change for the formation of methane (ΔHf° (CH4)) is the negative of the enthalpy of combustion (ΔHc° (CH4)):\n\nΔHf° (CH4) = -(-890.4 kJ/mol) = 890.4 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change for the formation of methane gas (CH4) from its elements is 890.4 kJ/mol."
