    "message_2": "The molecule described is ethyne, also known as acetylene, with the molecular formula C2H2. In this molecule, each carbon atom is bonded to one hydrogen atom and forms a triple bond with the other carbon atom.\n\nThe molecular geometry of ethyne is linear. This is because the carbon atoms are sp-hybridized, meaning they have two electron domains (one triple bond and one single bond) around each carbon atom. Since these electron domains are arranged as far apart as possible to minimize electron repulsion, the molecule adopts a linear shape.\n\nThe bond angle in a linear molecule is 180 degrees. Therefore, the bond angles in ethyne are 180 degrees between the carbon-carbon triple bond and the carbon-hydrogen single bonds."
