    "message_2": "To calculate the change in entropy (ΔS) for the reaction, we need to find the difference between the entropy of the products and the entropy of the reactants. The reaction is as follows:\n\n3 CO(g) + 3 O2(g) → 3 CO2(g)\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard molar entropies (S°) for each of the gases involved in the reaction. These values can be found in standard thermodynamic tables. The values are:\n\nS°(CO) = 197.7 J/mol·K\nS°(O2) = 205.2 J/mol·K\nS°(CO2) = 213.8 J/mol·K\n\nNext, we calculate the total entropy of the reactants and products:\n\nTotal entropy of reactants = (3 moles CO × S°(CO)) + (3 moles O2 × S°(O2))\nTotal entropy of reactants = (3 × 197.7 J/mol·K) + (3 × 205.2 J/mol·K)\nTotal entropy of reactants = 593.1 J/mol·K + 615.6 J/mol·K\nTotal entropy of reactants = 1208.7 J/mol·K\n\nTotal entropy of products = (3 moles CO2 × S°(CO2))\nTotal entropy of products = (3 × 213.8 J/mol·K)\nTotal entropy of products = 641.4 J/mol·K\n\nNow, we can calculate the change in entropy (ΔS) for the reaction:\n\nΔS = Total entropy of products - Total entropy of reactants\nΔS = 641.4 J/mol·K - 1208.7 J/mol·K\nΔS = -567.3 J/mol·K\n\nThe change in entropy (ΔS) for the reaction is -567.3 J/mol·K."
