    "message_2": "To calculate the electrical double layer thickness (also known as the Debye length) of a silica particle, we need to consider the Debye-Hückel theory. The Debye length (κ⁻¹) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nκ⁻¹ = (ε₀εrRT / 2F²I)^(1/2)\n\nwhere:\nε₀ = vacuum permittivity (8.854 x 10⁻¹² F/m)\nεr = relative permittivity of water (approximately 78.5 at room temperature)\nR = gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\nT = temperature in Kelvin (assume room temperature, 298 K)\nF = Faraday's constant (96485 C/mol)\nI = ionic strength of the solution (in mol/m³)\n\nTo find the ionic strength (I), we need to know the concentration of ions in the solution. Since we are given the surface charge density (σ) of the silica particle, we can estimate the ionic strength using the Gouy-Chapman theory. The Gouy-Chapman equation is:\n\nσ = 2 * (z * e * N₀ * C) * sinh(e * ψ₀ / 2kT)\n\nwhere:\nσ = surface charge density (-0.05 C/m²)\nz = valence of counterions (assume monovalent counterions, z = 1)\ne = elementary charge (1.602 x 10⁻¹⁹ C)\nN₀ = Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10²³ mol⁻¹)\nC = concentration of counterions (in mol/m³)\nψ₀ = surface potential (in V)\nk = Boltzmann's constant (1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K)\n\nWe can rearrange the Gouy-Chapman equation to solve for the concentration of counterions (C):\n\nC = σ / (2 * z * e * N₀ * sinh(e * ψ₀ / 2kT))\n\nAssuming that the surface potential (ψ₀) is large enough that sinh(e * ψ₀ / 2kT) ≈ e * ψ₀ / 2kT, we can simplify the equation to:\n\nC = σ / (2 * z * e * N₀ * (e * ψ₀ / 2kT))\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values and constants:\n\nC = (-0.05 C/m²) / (2 * 1 * (1.602 x 10⁻¹⁹ C) * (6.022 x 10²³ mol⁻¹) * ((1.602 x 10⁻¹⁹ C) * ψ₀ / (2 * (1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K) * 298 K)))\n\nSince we don't have the surface potential (ψ₀), we cannot find the exact concentration of counterions (C). However, we can still express the Debye length (κ⁻¹) in terms of ψ₀:\n\nκ⁻¹ = (ε₀εrRT / 2F²I)^(1/2) = (ε₀εrRT / 2F² * 2C)^(1/2)\n\nPlugging in the values and constants:\n\nκ⁻¹ = ((8.854 x 10⁻¹² F/m * 78.5 * 8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K) / (2 * (96485 C/mol)² * 2 * (-0.05 C/m²) / (2 * 1 * (1.602 x 10⁻¹⁹ C) * (6.022 x 10²³ mol⁻¹) * ((1.602 x 10⁻¹⁹ C) * ψ₀ / (2 * (1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K) * 298 K)))))^(1/2)\n\nThis equation gives the electrical double layer thickness (Debye length) of the silica particle in terms of the surface potential (ψ₀). To find the exact value of the Debye length, we would need the surface potential or the concentration of counterions in the solution."
