    "message_2": "When ethanol (C2H5OH) undergoes oxidation, it forms acetaldehyde (CH3CHO). The oxidation state of the carbon atom in ethanol is -2, and in acetaldehyde, the oxidation state of the same carbon atom is +1. So, after undergoing oxidation, the oxidation state of the carbon atom in the ethanol molecule becomes +1."
