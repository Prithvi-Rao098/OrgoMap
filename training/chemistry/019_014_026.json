Write down the balanced chemical equation for the reaction and determine the limiting reagent. Assume that the reaction occurs at standard temperature and pressure (STP).",
    "message_2": "First, let's write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nBa(NO₃)₂ (aq) + Na₂SO₄ (aq) → BaSO₄ (s) + 2 NaNO₃ (aq)\n\nNow, let's determine the limiting reagent. We have 50 mL of 0.1 M barium nitrate and 75 mL of 0.2 M sodium sulfate.\n\nMoles of Ba(NO₃)₂ = (50 mL) * (0.1 mol/L) = 5 mmol\nMoles of Na₂SO₄ = (75 mL) * (0.2 mol/L) = 15 mmol\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of Ba(NO₃)₂ reacts with 1 mole of Na₂SO₄. Therefore, the limiting reagent is Ba(NO₃)₂ since it has fewer moles (5 mmol) compared to Na₂SO₄ (15 mmol).\n\nNow, to find the standard enthalpy change for the precipitation reaction, we need to know the standard enthalpies of formation for the reactants and products. The standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) are as follows:\n\nΔHf° (Ba(NO₃)₂) = -824 kJ/mol\nΔHf° (Na₂SO₄) = -1384 kJ/mol\nΔHf° (BaSO₄) = -1465 kJ/mol\nΔHf° (NaNO₃) = -425 kJ/mol\n\nUsing Hess's Law, we can calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction (ΔHr°):\n\nΔHr° = [ΔHf° (BaSO₄) + 2 * ΔHf° (NaNO₃)] - [ΔHf° (Ba(NO₃)₂) + ΔHf° (Na₂SO₄)]\n\nΔHr° = [(-1465 kJ/mol) + 2 * (-425 kJ/mol)] - [(-824 kJ/mol) + (-1384 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔHr° = (-1465 - 850 + 824 + 1384) kJ/mol\n\nΔHr° = -107 kJ/mol\n\nSince the limiting reagent is Ba(NO₃)₂ with 5 mmol, the total standard enthalpy change for the reaction is:\n\nΔH = (-107 kJ/mol) * (5 mmol) * (1 mol / 1000 mmol) = -0.535 kJ\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change for the precipitation reaction when 50 mL of 0.1 M solution of barium nitrate is added to 75 mL of 0.2 M solution of sodium sulfate is -0.535 kJ."
