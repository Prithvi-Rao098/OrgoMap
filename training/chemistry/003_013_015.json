    "message_2": "To calculate the irreversible work done by a gas expanding adiabatically against a constant external pressure, we can use the formula:\n\nW = -P_ext * ΔV\n\nwhere W is the work done, P_ext is the constant external pressure, and ΔV is the change in volume.\n\nGiven the initial volume (V1) is 1 L and the final volume (V2) is 5 L, we can calculate the change in volume:\n\nΔV = V2 - V1 = 5 L - 1 L = 4 L\n\nThe external pressure (P_ext) is given as 2 atm. To convert the volume from liters to cubic meters, we can use the conversion factor 1 L = 0.001 m³:\n\nΔV = 4 L * 0.001 m³/L = 0.004 m³\n\nNow, we need to convert the pressure from atm to Pascal (Pa) using the conversion factor 1 atm = 101325 Pa:\n\nP_ext = 2 atm * 101325 Pa/atm = 202650 Pa\n\nNow we can calculate the work done:\n\nW = -P_ext * ΔV = -202650 Pa * 0.004 m³ = -810.6 J\n\nTherefore, the irreversible work done by the gas expanding adiabatically is -810.6 Joules. The negative sign indicates that the work is done by the gas on the surroundings."
