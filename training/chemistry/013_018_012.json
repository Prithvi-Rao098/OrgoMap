    "message_2": "To determine the percentage removal of methylene blue dye from a water sample using activated carbon as an adsorbent, you will need to perform an experiment and collect data. Here is a general outline of the steps you should follow:\n\n1. Prepare the water sample: Add a known concentration of methylene blue dye to a known volume of water. This will be your initial concentration (C0).\n\n2. Adjust the experimental conditions: Set the desired pH, temperature, and contact time for the experiment.\n\n3. Add activated carbon: Weigh a known amount of activated carbon and add it to the water sample. Stir the mixture to ensure proper contact between the dye and the adsorbent.\n\n4. Allow contact time: Let the mixture sit for the predetermined contact time to allow the adsorption process to occur.\n\n5. Separate the activated carbon: After the contact time has passed, filter the mixture to separate the activated carbon from the water sample. The remaining water sample will contain the residual methylene blue dye.\n\n6. Measure the residual dye concentration: Use a spectrophotometer or another analytical method to determine the concentration of methylene blue dye in the water sample after treatment. This will be your final concentration (Cf).\n\n7. Calculate the percentage removal: Use the initial (C0) and final (Cf) concentrations to calculate the percentage removal of methylene blue dye using the following formula:\n\nPercentage removal = [(C0 - Cf) / C0] Ã— 100\n\nThis will give you the percentage removal of methylene blue dye from the water sample under the specific experimental conditions you set (pH, temperature, and contact time)."
