    "message_1": "How much bromine (in grams) is needed to prepare 20 grams of 4-bromoacetanilide from acetanilide and bromine, assuming a yield of 80% for the reaction?",
    "message_2": "To determine the amount of bromine needed, we first need to find the moles of 4-bromoacetanilide that will be produced and then use stoichiometry to find the moles of bromine required. Finally, we will convert the moles of bromine to grams.\n\n1. Calculate the moles of 4-bromoacetanilide produced:\nThe molecular weight of 4-bromoacetanilide is 214.06 g/mol (C8H8BrNO).\n20 g of 4-bromoacetanilide * (1 mol / 214.06 g) = 0.0934 mol of 4-bromoacetanilide\n\n2. Adjust for the 80% yield:\nSince the reaction has an 80% yield, we need to find the moles of 4-bromoacetanilide that would be produced if the reaction had a 100% yield.\n0.0934 mol / 0.8 = 0.11675 mol of 4-bromoacetanilide (100% yield)\n\n3. Determine the moles of bromine required:\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\nC8H9NO + Br2 â†’ C8H8BrNO + HBr\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of bromine (Br2) is required for every 1 mole of 4-bromoacetanilide produced.\nSo, 0.11675 mol of 4-bromoacetanilide requires 0.11675 mol of bromine (Br2).\n\n4. Convert moles of bromine to grams:\nThe molecular weight of bromine (Br2) is 159.808 g/mol.\n0.11675 mol of Br2 * (159.808 g / 1 mol) = 18.65 g of bromine\n\nTherefore, 18.65 grams of bromine are needed to prepare 20 grams of 4-bromoacetanilide, assuming an 80% yield for the reaction."
