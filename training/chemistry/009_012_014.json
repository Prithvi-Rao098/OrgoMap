    "message_2": "Radioactive isotopes, also known as radioisotopes, are widely used in medical applications due to their unique properties. They emit radiation that can be detected and measured, allowing for various diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Some of the most commonly used radioisotopes in medical applications include:\n\n1. Technetium-99m (Tc-99m): This is the most widely used radioisotope in medical imaging, particularly for single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans. Tc-99m is used as a tracer to visualize the function of various organs, such as the heart, brain, and kidneys. It has a short half-life of 6 hours, which minimizes radiation exposure to the patient.\n\n2. Iodine-131 (I-131): I-131 is used in the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid disorders, such as hyperthyroidism and thyroid cancer. It is selectively taken up by the thyroid gland, allowing for targeted radiation therapy. I-131 has a half-life of 8 days, which allows for effective treatment while minimizing radiation exposure.\n\n3. Fluorine-18 (F-18): F-18 is used in positron emission tomography (PET) scans, which provide detailed images of metabolic processes in the body. F-18 is often combined with glucose to create fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), which is taken up by cells with high metabolic activity, such as cancer cells. F-18 has a short half-life of approximately 110 minutes, which minimizes radiation exposure.\n\n4. Gallium-67 (Ga-67): Ga-67 is used in nuclear medicine imaging to detect infections and tumors. It is particularly useful for imaging lymphomas and other soft tissue tumors. Ga-67 has a half-life of 78 hours, which allows for adequate imaging time while minimizing radiation exposure.\n\n5. Strontium-89 (Sr-89) and Samarium-153 (Sm-153): These radioisotopes are used for pain relief in patients with bone metastases from cancer. They emit beta particles that can kill cancer cells and reduce pain. Sr-89 has a half-life of 50 days, while Sm-153 has a half-life of 47 hours.\n\nCompared to non-radioactive isotopes, radioisotopes have unstable nuclei that emit radiation in the form of alpha, beta, or gamma particles. This property allows them to be used as tracers in diagnostic imaging and as targeted therapy for specific diseases. Non-radioactive isotopes do not emit radiation and, therefore, cannot be used for these purposes. However, non-radioactive isotopes can be used as stable tracers in other medical applications, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and mass spectrometry."
