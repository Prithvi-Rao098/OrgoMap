    "message_2": "To determine the formal charge on each atom in SO3, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the number of valence electrons for each atom.\n2. Calculate the number of electrons each atom would have if all bonding electrons were shared equally.\n3. Subtract the number of electrons assigned in step 2 from the number of valence electrons for each atom.\n\nSO3 has one sulfur (S) atom and three oxygen (O) atoms. The number of valence electrons for each atom is:\n\n- Sulfur (S): 6 valence electrons (from group 16 in the periodic table)\n- Oxygen (O): 6 valence electrons (from group 16 in the periodic table)\n\nNow, let's look at the Lewis structure of SO3. In SO3, sulfur is double bonded to two oxygen atoms and single bonded to one oxygen atom. Each double bond consists of 4 electrons (2 pairs), and each single bond consists of 2 electrons (1 pair).\n\n1. For sulfur (S):\n   - 2 double bonds: 4 electrons (2 from each double bond)\n   - 1 single bond: 2 electrons (1 from the single bond)\n   - Total electrons assigned to S: 6 electrons\n\n2. For the two oxygen atoms with double bonds (O):\n   - 1 double bond: 4 electrons (2 from the double bond)\n   - 2 lone pairs: 4 electrons (2 from each lone pair)\n   - Total electrons assigned to each O: 8 electrons\n\n3. For the oxygen atom with a single bond (O):\n   - 1 single bond: 2 electrons (1 from the single bond)\n   - 3 lone pairs: 6 electrons (2 from each lone pair)\n   - Total electrons assigned to O: 8 electrons\n\nNow, we can calculate the formal charge for each atom:\n\n- Formal charge on S: 6 (valence electrons) - 6 (assigned electrons) = 0\n- Formal charge on each double-bonded O: 6 (valence electrons) - 8 (assigned electrons) = -1\n- Formal charge on single-bonded O: 6 (valence electrons) - 8 (assigned electrons) = -1\n\nSo, the formal charges on the atoms in SO3 are:\n\n- Sulfur (S): 0\n- Two oxygen atoms with double bonds (O): -1 each\n- One oxygen atom with a single bond (O): -1"
