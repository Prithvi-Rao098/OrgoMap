    "message_1": "How much nitric acid (in mL) is required to prepare 10 g of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid from 5 g of benzoic acid assuming a 90% yield?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the balanced chemical equation for the reaction.\n2. Calculate the moles of benzoic acid and 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid.\n3. Use stoichiometry to determine the moles of nitric acid required.\n4. Convert moles of nitric acid to volume (mL) using its density and molar mass.\n\n1. Balanced chemical equation:\nC6H5COOH (benzoic acid) + 2 HNO3 (nitric acid) â†’ C6H3N2O8 (2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid) + 2 H2O (water)\n\n2. Calculate the moles of benzoic acid and 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid:\nMolar mass of benzoic acid = 12.01 * 7 + 1.01 * 6 + 16.00 * 2 = 122.12 g/mol\nMoles of benzoic acid = mass / molar mass = 5 g / 122.12 g/mol = 0.0409 mol\n\nSince the yield is 90%, we need to account for this when calculating the moles of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid:\nMoles of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid = 0.0409 mol * 0.9 = 0.0368 mol\n\n3. Use stoichiometry to determine the moles of nitric acid required:\nFrom the balanced equation, 1 mol of benzoic acid reacts with 2 mol of nitric acid. Therefore,\nMoles of nitric acid = 0.0409 mol * 2 = 0.0818 mol\n\n4. Convert moles of nitric acid to volume (mL) using its density and molar mass:\nMolar mass of nitric acid = 1.01 * 1 + 14.01 * 1 + 16.00 * 3 = 63.02 g/mol\nDensity of concentrated nitric acid (approx. 70% w/w) = 1.42 g/mL\n\nFirst, we need to find the mass of nitric acid:\nMass of nitric acid = moles * molar mass = 0.0818 mol * 63.02 g/mol = 5.15 g\n\nSince the concentrated nitric acid is approximately 70% w/w, we need to find the total mass of the solution:\nTotal mass of the solution = 5.15 g / 0.7 = 7.36 g\n\nNow, we can find the volume of nitric acid:\nVolume of nitric acid = mass / density = 7.36 g / 1.42 g/mL = 5.18 mL\n\nTherefore, approximately 5.18 mL of concentrated nitric acid is required to prepare 10 g of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid from 5 g of benzoic acid, assuming a 90% yield."
