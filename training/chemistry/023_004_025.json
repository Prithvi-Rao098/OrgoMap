    "message_2": "To determine the maximum theoretical yield of acetylsalicylic acid, we first need to find the limiting reactant in the reaction between salicylic acid and acetic anhydride. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nC7H6O3 (salicylic acid) + C4H6O3 (acetic anhydride) → C9H8O4 (acetylsalicylic acid) + C2H4O2 (acetic acid)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given amounts of reactants to moles. The molar mass of salicylic acid is 138.12 g/mol, and the molar mass of acetic anhydride is 102.09 g/mol.\n\nMoles of salicylic acid = 2.5 g / 138.12 g/mol = 0.0181 mol\nThe density of acetic anhydride is 1.08 g/mL, so 5.5 mL weighs 5.5 mL × 1.08 g/mL = 5.94 g.\nMoles of acetic anhydride = 5.94 g / 102.09 g/mol = 0.0582 mol\n\nNow, we need to determine the limiting reactant by comparing the mole ratio of the reactants:\n\nMole ratio of salicylic acid to acetic anhydride = 0.0181 mol / 0.0582 mol = 0.311\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, salicylic acid is the limiting reactant because its mole ratio is less than 1.\n\nNow, we can calculate the maximum theoretical yield of acetylsalicylic acid using the moles of the limiting reactant (salicylic acid) and the stoichiometry of the reaction:\n\nMoles of acetylsalicylic acid = 0.0181 mol (since the stoichiometry is 1:1)\nThe molar mass of acetylsalicylic acid is 180.16 g/mol.\nMaximum theoretical yield = 0.0181 mol × 180.16 g/mol = 3.26 g\n\nThe maximum theoretical yield of acetylsalicylic acid that can be obtained when 2.5 grams of salicylic acid and 5.5 mL of acetic anhydride are used in the reaction is 3.26 grams.\n\nTo compare this to the actual yield obtained in the experiment, you would need to provide the actual yield value. The percent yield can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPercent yield = (actual yield / theoretical yield) × 100"
