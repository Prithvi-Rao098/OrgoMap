    "message_1": "What is the molecular shape of carbon dioxide (CO2) and how does it relate to its electronic geometry?",
    "message_2": "The molecular shape of carbon dioxide (CO2) is linear. This is because the central carbon atom is bonded to two oxygen atoms, and there are no lone pairs of electrons on the carbon atom. The electronic geometry of CO2 is also linear, as the electron pairs are distributed evenly around the central carbon atom in a 180-degree angle. In this case, the molecular shape and electronic geometry are the same, both being linear."
