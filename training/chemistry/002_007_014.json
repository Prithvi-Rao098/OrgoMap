    "message_2": "The reaction between calcium chloride (CaCl2) and sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) is a double displacement reaction, also known as a metathesis reaction. In this reaction, the cations (Ca2+ and Na+) and anions (Cl- and CO3 2-) switch places, forming new compounds. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nCaCl2 (aq) + Na2CO3 (aq) â†’ CaCO3 (s) + 2 NaCl (aq)\n\nThe products of the reaction are calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and sodium chloride (NaCl). Calcium carbonate is a solid that precipitates out of the solution, while sodium chloride remains dissolved in the aqueous solution."
