    "message_2": "To calculate the pH of a 0.2 M solution of acetic acid, we will use the formula for the acid dissociation constant (Ka) and the definition of pH.\n\nThe dissociation of acetic acid (CH₃COOH) in water can be represented as follows:\n\nCH₃COOH ⇌ CH₃COO⁻ + H⁺\n\nThe Ka expression for this reaction is:\n\nKa = [CH₃COO⁻][H⁺] / [CH₃COOH]\n\nWe can assume that the initial concentration of CH₃COO⁻ and H⁺ is 0, and the initial concentration of CH₃COOH is 0.2 M. Let x be the concentration of H⁺ ions at equilibrium. Then, the concentration of CH₃COO⁻ ions will also be x, and the concentration of CH₃COOH will be 0.2 - x.\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the Ka expression:\n\n1.8 × 10⁻⁵ = (x)(x) / (0.2 - x)\n\nSince Ka is very small, we can assume that x is much smaller than 0.2, so 0.2 - x ≈ 0.2:\n\n1.8 × 10⁻⁵ ≈ x² / 0.2\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx² = 1.8 × 10⁻⁵ * 0.2\nx² = 3.6 × 10⁻⁶\nx = √(3.6 × 10⁻⁶)\nx ≈ 1.9 × 10⁻³\n\nNow that we have the concentration of H⁺ ions (x), we can calculate the pH using the pH formula:\n\npH = -log[H⁺]\npH = -log(1.9 × 10⁻³)\npH ≈ 2.72\n\nThe pH of the 0.2 M solution of acetic acid is approximately 2.72."
