    "message_2": "To calculate the corrosion rate of the iron rod, we need to determine the mass loss of iron due to the electrochemical reaction. The reaction taking place is:\n\nFe (s) → Fe²⁺ (aq) + 2e⁻\n\nThe current (I) is given as 0.2 A. We can use Faraday's law of electrolysis to determine the mass loss of iron:\n\nm = (I × t × M) / (n × F)\n\nwhere:\nm = mass loss of iron (g)\nI = current (A)\nt = time (s)\nM = molar mass of iron (g/mol)\nn = number of electrons transferred in the reaction\nF = Faraday's constant (96485 C/mol)\n\nWe are given the current (I = 0.2 A) and the number of electrons transferred in the reaction (n = 2). The molar mass of iron (M) is 55.85 g/mol. However, we need the time (t) to calculate the mass loss of iron.\n\nSince we are asked for the corrosion rate, we can express it as mass loss per unit time (g/s). Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\ncorrosion rate = (I × M) / (n × F)\n\ncorrosion rate = (0.2 A × 55.85 g/mol) / (2 × 96485 C/mol)\n\ncorrosion rate = 0.000577 g/s\n\nNow, we need to convert the corrosion rate from mass loss per unit time to a unit of length, such as mm/year. To do this, we need the density (ρ) of iron and the surface area (A) of the iron rod:\n\nρ = 7.87 g/cm³ (density of iron)\nA = 20 cm² (surface area of the iron rod)\n\nWe can use the following equation to convert the corrosion rate to mm/year:\n\ncorrosion rate (mm/year) = (corrosion rate (g/s) × 10⁷ mm³/cm³ × 1 year) / (ρ (g/cm³) × A (cm²) × 3.1536 × 10⁷ s/year)\n\ncorrosion rate (mm/year) = (0.000577 g/s × 10⁷ mm³/cm³ × 1 year) / (7.87 g/cm³ × 20 cm² × 3.1536 × 10⁷ s/year)\n\ncorrosion rate (mm/year) ≈ 0.184 mm/year\n\nThe corrosion rate of the iron rod is approximately 0.184 mm/year."
