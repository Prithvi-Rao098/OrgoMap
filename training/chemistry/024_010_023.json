    "message_2": "To design a system using chemical engineering principles to effectively treat industrial wastewater containing high levels of heavy metals, such as lead and mercury, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Preliminary treatment: The first step is to remove large solid particles and debris from the wastewater through screening, sedimentation, and flotation processes. This will help to reduce the load on the subsequent treatment processes.\n\n2. Chemical precipitation: This process involves the addition of chemicals, such as lime or sodium hydroxide, to the wastewater to increase its pH. This causes the heavy metals to form insoluble metal hydroxides, which can then be easily removed by sedimentation or filtration. The choice of precipitating agent depends on the specific heavy metals present in the wastewater and their solubility characteristics.\n\n3. Coagulation and flocculation: Coagulants, such as aluminum sulfate or ferric chloride, are added to the wastewater to neutralize the negative charges on the suspended particles, allowing them to aggregate and form larger flocs. Flocculants, such as polyacrylamide, can also be added to enhance the aggregation process. The flocs can then be removed by sedimentation or filtration.\n\n4. Ion exchange: This process involves passing the wastewater through a bed of ion exchange resin, which selectively binds to the heavy metal ions and removes them from the solution. The resin can be regenerated by washing it with a concentrated solution of the desired metal ions, allowing it to be reused multiple times.\n\n5. Membrane filtration: Membrane processes, such as ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, or reverse osmosis, can be used to separate heavy metals from the wastewater. These processes involve forcing the wastewater through a semi-permeable membrane, which allows water and small dissolved ions to pass through while retaining larger ions, such as heavy metals.\n\n6. Adsorption: Activated carbon, zeolites, or other adsorbent materials can be used to remove heavy metals from the wastewater by adsorbing them onto their surfaces. The adsorbent material can be regenerated by washing it with a concentrated solution of the desired metal ions, allowing it to be reused multiple times.\n\n7. Biological treatment: Certain microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi, can accumulate heavy metals from the wastewater and convert them into less toxic forms. These microorganisms can be cultivated in a bioreactor and used to treat the wastewater in a controlled environment.\n\n8. Post-treatment: After the heavy metals have been removed, the treated wastewater may still require further treatment to remove residual organic matter, nutrients, or other contaminants. This can be achieved through additional biological treatment, membrane filtration, or other suitable processes.\n\n9. Monitoring and control: The performance of the treatment system should be continuously monitored to ensure that it is effectively removing the heavy metals from the wastewater. This can be achieved through regular sampling and analysis of the influent and effluent streams, as well as the monitoring of key process parameters, such as pH, temperature, and flow rate.\n\nBy implementing these steps in a well-designed treatment system, it is possible to effectively remove heavy metals from industrial wastewater and prevent their discharge into the natural environment, thus reducing environmental pollution."
