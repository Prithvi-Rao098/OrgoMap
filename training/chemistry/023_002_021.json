    "message_2": "To determine the yield of benzocaine, we need to know the balanced chemical equation for the reaction. The reaction between p-aminobenzoic acid and ethanol to form benzocaine and water is as follows:\n\np-aminobenzoic acid + ethanol → benzocaine + water\n\nFirst, we need to determine the limiting reactant. To do this, we need the molar mass of p-aminobenzoic acid and ethanol.\n\nMolar mass of p-aminobenzoic acid (C7H7NO2) = (7 × 12.01) + (7 × 1.01) + (1 × 14.01) + (2 × 16.00) = 137.14 g/mol\nMolar mass of ethanol (C2H5OH) = (2 × 12.01) + (6 × 1.01) + (1 × 16.00) = 46.07 g/mol\n\nNext, we need to convert the given mass of p-aminobenzoic acid and volume of ethanol to moles.\n\n5 g p-aminobenzoic acid × (1 mol / 137.14 g) = 0.0364 mol p-aminobenzoic acid\n\nAssuming the density of ethanol is 0.789 g/mL, we can convert the volume to mass and then to moles:\n\n10 mL ethanol × (0.789 g/mL) = 7.89 g ethanol\n7.89 g ethanol × (1 mol / 46.07 g) = 0.171 mol ethanol\n\nNow we can determine the limiting reactant by comparing the mole ratio of p-aminobenzoic acid and ethanol:\n\n0.0364 mol p-aminobenzoic acid / 1 = 0.0364\n0.171 mol ethanol / 1 = 0.171\n\nSince 0.0364 is smaller than 0.171, p-aminobenzoic acid is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow we can calculate the theoretical yield of benzocaine using the stoichiometry of the balanced equation:\n\n0.0364 mol p-aminobenzoic acid × (1 mol benzocaine / 1 mol p-aminobenzoic acid) = 0.0364 mol benzocaine\n\nFinally, we convert the moles of benzocaine to grams using its molar mass (C9H11NO2):\n\nMolar mass of benzocaine = (9 × 12.01) + (11 × 1.01) + (1 × 14.01) + (2 × 16.00) = 165.19 g/mol\n\n0.0364 mol benzocaine × (165.19 g / 1 mol) = 6.01 g benzocaine\n\nThe theoretical yield of benzocaine is 6.01 grams. However, the actual yield may be lower due to side reactions, incomplete reactions, or loss during the purification process."
