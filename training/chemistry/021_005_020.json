    "message_2": "The bond between carbon and oxygen in carbon monoxide (CO) is polar. This is because oxygen is more electronegative than carbon, which means it attracts the shared electrons in the bond more strongly. As a result, there is an uneven distribution of electron density, with a partial negative charge on the oxygen atom and a partial positive charge on the carbon atom. This creates a polar bond in carbon monoxide."
