    "message_2": "In water, the primary type of intermolecular force present is hydrogen bonding. This occurs due to the polar nature of the water molecule, where the oxygen atom is more electronegative than the hydrogen atoms, creating a partial negative charge on the oxygen and partial positive charges on the hydrogens. These partial charges allow for the formation of hydrogen bonds between the oxygen of one water molecule and the hydrogen of another. Additionally, water also exhibits dipole-dipole interactions and dispersion forces (also known as London forces), but hydrogen bonding is the strongest and most significant of these forces in water."
