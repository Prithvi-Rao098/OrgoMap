(Hint: The binding energy of a nucleus is equal to the total mass of its individual nucleons minus the actual mass of the nucleus.)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the binding energy per nucleon for a helium-4 nucleus, we first need to find the total mass of its individual nucleons and then subtract the actual mass of the nucleus.\n\nA helium-4 nucleus contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons. \n\nTotal mass of 2 protons = 2 * 1.0073 atomic mass units = 2.0146 atomic mass units\nTotal mass of 2 neutrons = 2 * 1.0087 atomic mass units = 2.0174 atomic mass units\n\nTotal mass of individual nucleons = 2.0146 + 2.0174 = 4.0320 atomic mass units\n\nNow, we can find the binding energy of the helium-4 nucleus:\n\nBinding energy = Total mass of individual nucleons - Actual mass of the nucleus\nBinding energy = 4.0320 - 4.0015 = 0.0305 atomic mass units\n\nTo convert the binding energy from atomic mass units to MeV (mega-electron volts), we use the conversion factor 1 atomic mass unit = 931.5 MeV:\n\nBinding energy = 0.0305 atomic mass units * 931.5 MeV/atomic mass unit = 28.42 MeV\n\nNow, we can find the binding energy per nucleon by dividing the binding energy by the number of nucleons in the helium-4 nucleus (2 protons + 2 neutrons = 4 nucleons):\n\nBinding energy per nucleon = 28.42 MeV / 4 = 7.105 MeV/nucleon\n\nSo, the binding energy per nucleon for a helium-4 nucleus is approximately 7.105 MeV/nucleon."
