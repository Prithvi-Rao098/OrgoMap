    "message_2": "The biosynthesis of the amino acid tyrosine occurs through a series of enzymatic reactions. The primary pathway for tyrosine biosynthesis is derived from the essential amino acid phenylalanine. Here is the order of enzymatic reactions involved in the biosynthesis of tyrosine:\n\n1. Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) reaction:\nThe first step in the biosynthesis of tyrosine is the hydroxylation of phenylalanine to form tyrosine. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). PAH is a non-heme iron-containing enzyme that uses molecular oxygen and the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) to hydroxylate the phenylalanine at the para-position of the phenyl ring. The reaction mechanism involves the formation of a high-valent iron-oxo intermediate, which abstracts a hydrogen atom from the phenylalanine substrate. This leads to the formation of a phenyl radical, which then reacts with the hydroxyl group to form tyrosine.\n\n2. Prephenate dehydrogenase (PDH) reaction:\nIn some microorganisms, tyrosine can also be synthesized from chorismate through the prephenate pathway. The first enzyme in this pathway is prephenate dehydratase, which converts chorismate to prephenate. The next enzyme, prephenate dehydrogenase (PDH), catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of prephenate to form 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate. PDH is an NAD+-dependent enzyme, and the reaction proceeds through the formation of a Schiff base intermediate between the enzyme and the substrate. The decarboxylation step is followed by the reduction of the imine intermediate to form 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate.\n\n3. 4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) reaction:\nThe final step in the biosynthesis of tyrosine is the conversion of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate to tyrosine. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD). HPPD is a non-heme iron-containing enzyme that uses molecular oxygen to insert an oxygen atom between the keto group and the phenyl ring of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate. The reaction proceeds through the formation of a high-valent iron-oxo intermediate, which attacks the keto group of the substrate to form a cyclic intermediate. This intermediate then undergoes a rearrangement and hydrolysis to release tyrosine and carbon dioxide.\n\nIn summary, the order of enzymatic reactions involved in the biosynthesis of tyrosine is as follows:\n\n1. Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) reaction: Phenylalanine → Tyrosine\n2. Prephenate dehydrogenase (PDH) reaction (in some microorganisms): Chorismate → Prephenate → 4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate\n3. 4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) reaction: 4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate → Tyrosine"
