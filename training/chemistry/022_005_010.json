    "message_2": "The balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane (CH4) in the presence of oxygen (O2) is:\n\nCH4 + 2O2 â†’ CO2 + 2H2O\n\nIf 10 moles of methane are combusted completely, the theoretical yield of carbon dioxide (CO2) can be calculated using the stoichiometry of the balanced equation. Since there is a 1:1 ratio between methane and carbon dioxide, the theoretical yield of CO2 will be the same as the moles of methane.\n\nTherefore, the theoretical yield of CO2 is 10 moles."
