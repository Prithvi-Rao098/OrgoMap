    "message_2": "To calculate the standard cell potential (E°) for the given electrochemical cell, we first need to identify the anode (oxidation) and cathode (reduction) half-reactions. The half-reaction with the more negative standard reduction potential will be the anode (oxidation), and the half-reaction with the less negative (or more positive) standard reduction potential will be the cathode (reduction).\n\nGiven:\nE°cell (Zn2+/Zn) = -0.76 V (more negative)\nE°cell (Cr3+/Cr) = -0.74 V (less negative)\n\nSo, the anode half-reaction is:\nZn(s) → Zn2+(aq) + 2e- (oxidation)\n\nAnd the cathode half-reaction is:\nCr3+(aq) + 3e- → Cr(s) (reduction)\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard cell potential (E°) for the cell using the equation:\n\nE°cell = E°cathode - E°anode\n\nE°cell = (-0.74 V) - (-0.76 V)\nE°cell = 0.02 V\n\nThe standard cell potential (E°) for the given electrochemical cell is 0.02 V."
