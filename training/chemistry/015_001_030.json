    "message_2": "The molecular orbital diagram of a nitrogen molecule (N2) shows the combination of atomic orbitals from two nitrogen atoms to form molecular orbitals. In N2, both nitrogen atoms have the electron configuration 1s² 2s² 2p³. When these atomic orbitals combine, they form molecular orbitals with different energy levels.\n\nHere is the molecular orbital diagram for N2:\n\n1. The two 1s orbitals from each nitrogen atom combine to form two molecular orbitals: one sigma (σ) bonding orbital (lower energy) and one sigma (σ*) antibonding orbital (higher energy). Both σ and σ* orbitals are filled with 2 electrons each (total 4 electrons).\n\n2. The two 2s orbitals from each nitrogen atom combine to form two molecular orbitals: one sigma (σ) bonding orbital (lower energy) and one sigma (σ*) antibonding orbital (higher energy). Both σ and σ* orbitals are filled with 2 electrons each (total 4 electrons).\n\n3. The six 2p orbitals from the two nitrogen atoms combine to form six molecular orbitals: one sigma (σ) bonding orbital, two pi (π) bonding orbitals, one sigma (σ*) antibonding orbital, and two pi (π*) antibonding orbitals. The σ bonding orbital is filled with 2 electrons, and the two π bonding orbitals are filled with 2 electrons each (total 6 electrons). The σ* antibonding orbital and the two π* antibonding orbitals remain empty.\n\nThe electronic structure of N2 can be represented as:\n\n(1σ)² (1σ*)² (2σ)² (2σ*)² (3σ)² (1π)⁴\n\nThe bond order, which indicates the stability of the molecule, can be calculated as:\n\nBond order = (number of electrons in bonding orbitals - number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2\n\nFor N2:\n\nBond order = (10 - 4) / 2 = 3\n\nThis means that N2 has a triple bond between the two nitrogen atoms, making it a very stable molecule."
