    "message_2": "To calculate the heat of hydration for the dissolution of 10 grams of calcium chloride in 200 mL of water, we need to first determine the number of moles of calcium chloride and then use the heat of hydration value given.\n\nCalcium chloride (CaCl₂) has a molar mass of 40.08 g/mol (Ca) + 2 * 35.45 g/mol (Cl) = 110.98 g/mol.\n\nNow, we can find the number of moles of calcium chloride:\n\nmoles = mass / molar mass\nmoles = 10 g / 110.98 g/mol ≈ 0.0901 mol\n\nNow, we can use the heat of hydration value given (-82.8 kJ/mol) to find the heat of hydration for the dissolution of 10 grams of calcium chloride:\n\nq = moles * heat of hydration\nq = 0.0901 mol * -82.8 kJ/mol ≈ -7.46 kJ\n\nThe heat of hydration for the dissolution of 10 grams of calcium chloride in 200 mL of water at a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius is approximately -7.46 kJ."
