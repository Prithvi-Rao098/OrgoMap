    "message_2": "To find the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid, we can use the Ka expression and the formula for pH. The Ka expression for acetic acid is:\n\nKa = [H+][CH3COO-] / [CH3COOH]\n\nSince the initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.1 M, we can assume that the change in concentration of acetic acid and its conjugate base (acetate ion) is x:\n\n[H+] = x\n[CH3COO-] = x\n[CH3COOH] = 0.1 - x\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Ka expression:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 = x^2 / (0.1 - x)\n\nSince Ka is very small, we can assume that x is also very small compared to 0.1, so we can simplify the equation:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 ≈ x^2 / 0.1\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx^2 = 1.8 x 10^-5 * 0.1\nx^2 = 1.8 x 10^-6\nx = √(1.8 x 10^-6)\nx ≈ 1.34 x 10^-3\n\nSince x is equal to the concentration of H+ ions, we can now calculate the pH using the formula:\n\npH = -log[H+]\n\npH = -log(1.34 x 10^-3)\npH ≈ 2.87\n\nTherefore, the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid is approximately 2.87."
