    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (K) for the reaction, we can use the expression:\n\nK = [C]^4 * [D]^2 / ([A]^2 * [B]^3)\n\nGiven the equilibrium concentrations of A, B, C, and D:\n\nA = 0.2 M\nB = 0.3 M\nC = 0.4 M\nD = 0.5 M\n\nPlug these values into the K expression:\n\nK = (0.4^4 * 0.5^2) / (0.2^2 * 0.3^3)\n\nK = (0.0256 * 0.25) / (0.04 * 0.027)\n\nK ≈ 6.25\n\nThe equilibrium constant for the given reaction at 298K is approximately 6.25."
