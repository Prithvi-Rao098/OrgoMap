    "message_1": "What mass of carbon dioxide (CO2) will be produced when 25 grams of methane (CH4) are burned in excess oxygen gas (O2)?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of stoichiometry. First, we need to write the balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane:\n\nCH4 + 2O2 â†’ CO2 + 2H2O\n\nNow, we need to find the molar mass of each compound involved:\n\nMolar mass of CH4 = 12.01 (C) + 4 * 1.01 (H) = 16.05 g/mol\nMolar mass of CO2 = 12.01 (C) + 2 * 16.00 (O) = 44.01 g/mol\n\nNext, we will convert the mass of methane (CH4) given to moles:\n\nmoles of CH4 = mass of CH4 / molar mass of CH4\nmoles of CH4 = 25 g / 16.05 g/mol = 1.557 moles\n\nNow, we will use the stoichiometry of the balanced equation to find the moles of carbon dioxide (CO2) produced:\n\nmoles of CO2 = moles of CH4 * (1 mol CO2 / 1 mol CH4)\nmoles of CO2 = 1.557 moles * (1/1) = 1.557 moles\n\nFinally, we will convert the moles of CO2 to mass:\n\nmass of CO2 = moles of CO2 * molar mass of CO2\nmass of CO2 = 1.557 moles * 44.01 g/mol = 68.52 g\n\nSo, when 25 grams of methane are burned in excess oxygen gas, 68.52 grams of carbon dioxide will be produced."
