    "message_2": "The balanced equation for the oxidation of 2-methyl-1-propanol (C4H10O) to form 2-methyl-1-propanal (C4H8O) using potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7) as the oxidizing agent in the presence of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is as follows:\n\nC4H10O + K2Cr2O7 + 4H2SO4 → C4H8O + Cr2(SO4)3 + K2SO4 + 7H2O\n\nNow, let's calculate the mass of potassium dichromate required to oxidize 5.6 g of 2-methyl-1-propanol.\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of 2-methyl-1-propanol:\n\nMoles of 2-methyl-1-propanol = mass / molar mass\nMolar mass of 2-methyl-1-propanol (C4H10O) = (4 × 12.01) + (10 × 1.01) + 16.00 = 74.14 g/mol\n\nMoles of 2-methyl-1-propanol = 5.6 g / 74.14 g/mol = 0.0755 moles\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of 2-methyl-1-propanol reacts with 1 mole of potassium dichromate. Therefore, 0.0755 moles of 2-methyl-1-propanol will react with 0.0755 moles of potassium dichromate.\n\nNow, let's find the mass of potassium dichromate:\n\nMolar mass of potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7) = (2 × 39.10) + (2 × 51.99) + (7 × 16.00) = 294.18 g/mol\n\nMass of potassium dichromate = moles × molar mass\nMass of potassium dichromate = 0.0755 moles × 294.18 g/mol = 22.21 g\n\nSo, 22.21 g of potassium dichromate is required to oxidize 5.6 g of 2-methyl-1-propanol."
