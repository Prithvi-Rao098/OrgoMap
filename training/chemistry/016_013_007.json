    "message_2": "To calculate the heat of hydration, we need to use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat absorbed or released, m is the mass of the solution, c is the specific heat capacity of the solution, and ΔT is the temperature change.\n\nGiven the mass of the solution (m) is 250 grams, the temperature change (ΔT) is -30 °C, and assuming the specific heat capacity (c) of the solution is similar to water (4.18 J/g·°C):\n\nq = (250 g)(4.18 J/g·°C)(-30 °C)\n\nq = -31,350 J\n\nSince the temperature change is negative, the reaction is exothermic and releases heat. Therefore, the heat of hydration for the reaction between 50 grams of anhydrous copper(II) sulfate and excess water is 31,350 J (released)."
