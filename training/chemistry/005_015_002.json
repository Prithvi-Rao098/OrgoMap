    "message_2": "The net ATP yield of one turn of the Citric Acid Cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle) and oxidative phosphorylation can be calculated by considering the production of high-energy molecules (NADH, FADH2) and GTP during the cycle, and then the conversion of these molecules into ATP through oxidative phosphorylation in the electron transport chain.\n\nIn one turn of the Citric Acid Cycle, the following high-energy molecules are produced:\n\n- 3 NADH molecules (from the oxidation of isocitrate, α-ketoglutarate, and malate)\n- 1 FADH2 molecule (from the oxidation of succinate)\n- 1 GTP molecule (from the substrate-level phosphorylation of GDP during the conversion of succinyl-CoA to succinate)\n\nNow, let's consider the conversion of these molecules into ATP through oxidative phosphorylation:\n\n- Each NADH molecule generates approximately 2.5 ATP molecules in the electron transport chain.\n- Each FADH2 molecule generates approximately 1.5 ATP molecules in the electron transport chain.\n- The GTP molecule produced in the Citric Acid Cycle is equivalent to 1 ATP molecule.\n\nSo, the net ATP yield of one turn of the Citric Acid Cycle and oxidative phosphorylation can be calculated as:\n\n(3 NADH × 2.5 ATP/NADH) + (1 FADH2 × 1.5 ATP/FADH2) + 1 GTP = 7.5 ATP + 1.5 ATP + 1 ATP = 10 ATP\n\nTherefore, the net ATP yield of one turn of the Citric Acid Cycle and oxidative phosphorylation is 10 ATP molecules."
