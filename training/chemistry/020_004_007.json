    "message_1": "How does the addition of a catalyst affect the equilibrium position and the rate of reaction for the reaction: \n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) â‡Œ 2NH3(g) \n\nif the initial concentrations are [N2] = 0.10 M, [H2] = 0.20 M, and [NH3] = 0.30 M? Calculate the new equilibrium concentrations and the percentage change in the equilibrium constant (Kc) when a catalyst is added to the system.",
    "message_2": "The addition of a catalyst to a chemical reaction does not affect the equilibrium position or the equilibrium constant (Kc) of the reaction. A catalyst works by lowering the activation energy of the reaction, which increases the rate at which the reaction reaches equilibrium. However, the catalyst does not change the relative energies of the reactants and products, so the equilibrium constant remains the same.\n\nIn this case, the initial concentrations are [N2] = 0.10 M, [H2] = 0.20 M, and [NH3] = 0.30 M. Since the addition of a catalyst does not affect the equilibrium position, the new equilibrium concentrations will be the same as the initial concentrations.\n\nTherefore, the new equilibrium concentrations are:\n[N2] = 0.10 M\n[H2] = 0.20 M\n[NH3] = 0.30 M\n\nSince the equilibrium constant (Kc) does not change with the addition of a catalyst, there is no percentage change in Kc. The equilibrium constant remains the same, and the only effect of the catalyst is to increase the rate at which the reaction reaches equilibrium."
