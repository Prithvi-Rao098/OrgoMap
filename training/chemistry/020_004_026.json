    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant (Kc) of the reaction at 25°C, we need the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) of the reaction. For the given reaction:\n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇄ 2NH3(g)\n\nThe standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) at 25°C is -33.6 kJ/mol. Now, we can use the following equation to calculate the equilibrium constant (Kc):\n\nΔG° = -RT ln(Kc)\n\nWhere:\nΔG° = -33.6 kJ/mol\nR = 8.314 J/(mol·K) (gas constant)\nT = 25°C = 298.15 K\n\nFirst, we need to convert ΔG° to J/mol:\n\nΔG° = -33.6 kJ/mol * 1000 J/kJ = -33600 J/mol\n\nNow, we can rearrange the equation to solve for Kc:\n\nln(Kc) = -ΔG° / (RT)\nKc = e^(-ΔG° / (RT))\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nKc = e^(-(-33600 J/mol) / (8.314 J/(mol·K) * 298.15 K))\nKc ≈ 6.02 x 10^2\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction at 25°C is approximately 6.02 x 10^2.\n\nNow, let's consider the effect of a catalyst on the equilibrium position. A catalyst speeds up the rate of a reaction by lowering the activation energy but does not affect the equilibrium constant (Kc). Therefore, the equilibrium constant (Kc) will remain the same, 6.02 x 10^2, with or without a catalyst.\n\nIn conclusion, the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction at 25°C is approximately 6.02 x 10^2, and the presence of a catalyst does not affect the equilibrium position."
