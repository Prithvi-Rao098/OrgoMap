The reaction occurs in acidic solution with a pH of 2.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard free energy change (ΔG°) for the redox reaction, we can use the Nernst equation:\n\nΔG° = -n * F * E°\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of electrons transferred, F is the Faraday's constant (96,485 C/mol), and E° is the standard cell potential.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the balanced redox reaction and the number of electrons transferred. The given reaction is already balanced:\n\n2Fe²⁺ (aq) + Cl₂ (g) -> 2Fe³⁺ (aq) + 2Cl⁻ (aq)\n\nIn this reaction, each Fe²⁺ ion loses one electron to become Fe³⁺, so a total of 2 moles of electrons are transferred.\n\nNext, we need to find the standard cell potential (E°). Since the reaction occurs in acidic solution, we can use the given standard reduction potentials:\n\nE°(Fe³⁺/Fe²⁺) = +0.77 V\nE°(Cl₂/2Cl⁻) = +1.36 V\n\nThe overall cell potential is the difference between the reduction potential of the oxidizing agent (Cl₂) and the reducing agent (Fe²⁺):\n\nE° = E°(Cl₂/2Cl⁻) - E°(Fe³⁺/Fe²⁺) = 1.36 V - 0.77 V = 0.59 V\n\nNow we can calculate the standard free energy change (ΔG°):\n\nΔG° = -n * F * E° = -2 mol * 96,485 C/mol * 0.59 V = -113,851.9 J/mol\n\nSince the standard free energy change is usually expressed in kJ/mol, we can convert the value:\n\nΔG° = -113.85 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard free energy change for the given redox reaction at 298 K is -113.85 kJ/mol."
