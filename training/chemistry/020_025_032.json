    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (K) for the reaction of iodine with hydrogen sulfite ion in acidic solution at 298 K, we can use the Nernst equation. First, let's write the balanced redox reaction:\n\n2 I⁻(aq) + HSO₃⁻(aq) + 2 H⁺(aq) → I₂(s) + SO₂(g) + H₂O(l)\n\nNow, we can use the Nernst equation:\n\nE = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\n\nwhere E is the cell potential at non-standard conditions, E° is the standard cell potential (+0.52 V), R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature (298 K), n is the number of moles of electrons transferred (2 in this case), F is the Faraday constant (96485 C/mol), and Q is the reaction quotient.\n\nAt equilibrium, E = 0, so we can rearrange the Nernst equation to solve for K (the equilibrium constant):\n\n0 = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(K)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and solve for K:\n\n0 = 0.52 - (8.314 * 298 / (2 * 96485)) * ln(K)\n\n0 = 0.52 - (0.0129) * ln(K)\n\n0.0129 * ln(K) = 0.52\n\nln(K) = 0.52 / 0.0129\n\nln(K) ≈ 40.31\n\nNow, we can find K by taking the exponent of both sides:\n\nK = e^(40.31)\n\nK ≈ 3.3 x 10^17\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant for the reaction of iodine with hydrogen sulfite ion in acidic solution at 298 K is approximately 3.3 x 10^17."
