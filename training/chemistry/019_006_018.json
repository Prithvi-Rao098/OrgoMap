    "message_1": "Determine the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction 2SO2(g) + O2(g) â‡Œ 2SO3(g), given that at a certain temperature, the initial concentrations of SO2, O2, and SO3 were 0.10 M, 0.20 M, and 0.05 M, respectively, and the reaction was allowed to reach equilibrium.",
    "message_2": "To determine the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction, we first need to find the equilibrium concentrations of all the species involved. Let's denote the change in concentration of SO2, O2, and SO3 as x.\n\nAt equilibrium, the concentrations will be:\n[SO2] = 0.10 - 2x\n[O2] = 0.20 - x\n[SO3] = 0.05 + 2x\n\nNow, we can write the expression for the equilibrium constant Kc:\n\nKc = [SO3]^2 / ([SO2]^2 * [O2])\n\nSubstitute the equilibrium concentrations into the Kc expression:\n\nKc = ((0.05 + 2x)^2) / (((0.10 - 2x)^2) * (0.20 - x))\n\nSince we don't have the value of Kc or x, we cannot solve for Kc directly. However, if we were given additional information, such as the equilibrium concentrations or the value of Kc, we could solve for the unknowns and find the equilibrium constant."
