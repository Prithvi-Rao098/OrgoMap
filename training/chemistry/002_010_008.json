    "message_2": "To find the density of sodium chloride (NaCl), we need to know the volume occupied by one mole of NaCl in its crystal lattice structure. Sodium chloride has a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal lattice structure, which means that the unit cell has a total of four NaCl formula units.\n\nFirst, we need to find the edge length (a) of the unit cell. The lattice constant (a) of NaCl is 5.64 Å (angstroms). To convert angstroms to meters, we use the conversion factor 1 Å = 1 × 10^-10 m. So, the edge length (a) in meters is:\n\na = 5.64 Å × (1 × 10^-10 m/Å) = 5.64 × 10^-10 m\n\nNow, we can find the volume (V) of the unit cell:\n\nV = a^3 = (5.64 × 10^-10 m)^3 = 1.79 × 10^-28 m^3\n\nSince there are four NaCl formula units in the unit cell, the volume occupied by one mole of NaCl (6.022 × 10^23 formula units) is:\n\nVolume of 1 mole NaCl = (1.79 × 10^-28 m^3/formula unit) × (6.022 × 10^23 formula units/mol) = 0.0108 m^3/mol\n\nNow, we can find the density (ρ) of NaCl using the formula:\n\nρ = mass/volume\n\nWe know the molar mass of NaCl is 58.44 g/mol, so the mass of one mole of NaCl is 58.44 g. To convert the volume from m^3 to mL, we use the conversion factor 1 m^3 = 1 × 10^6 mL:\n\nVolume of 1 mole NaCl = 0.0108 m^3/mol × (1 × 10^6 mL/m^3) = 10,800 mL/mol\n\nNow, we can find the density:\n\nρ = (58.44 g/mol) / (10,800 mL/mol) = 0.00541 g/mL\n\nThe density of sodium chloride (NaCl) is approximately 0.00541 g/mL."
