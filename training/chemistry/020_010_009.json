    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of the reaction quotient (Q) and the equilibrium constant (Ka). The reaction for the acetic acid and sodium acetate in water is as follows:\n\nCH3COOH (acetic acid) + H2O ⇌ CH3COO- (acetate) + H3O+ (hydronium ion)\n\nInitially, we have 0.1 M acetic acid and 0.01 moles of sodium acetate. Let's assume the volume of the solution is 1 L for simplicity. Therefore, the initial concentration of sodium acetate is 0.01 M. At equilibrium, some of the acetic acid will dissociate, and the concentration of acetate and hydronium ions will increase. Let x be the change in concentration of these species.\n\nInitial concentrations:\n[CH3COOH] = 0.1 M\n[CH3COO-] = 0.01 M\n[H3O+] = 0 M\n\nChanges in concentrations at equilibrium:\n[CH3COOH] = 0.1 - x M\n[CH3COO-] = 0.01 + x M\n[H3O+] = x M\n\nNow we can write the expression for Ka:\n\nKa = [CH3COO-][H3O+] / [CH3COOH]\n\nPlugging in the equilibrium concentrations:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 = (0.01 + x)(x) / (0.1 - x)\n\nTo simplify the equation, we can make an assumption that x is very small compared to 0.1 and 0.01. Therefore, we can approximate the equation as:\n\n1.8 x 10^-5 ≈ (0.01)(x) / 0.1\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx ≈ (1.8 x 10^-5)(0.1) / 0.01\nx ≈ 1.8 x 10^-4 M\n\nSince x is the equilibrium concentration of H3O+ ions, we can now find the equilibrium concentrations of the other species:\n\n[CH3COOH] ≈ 0.1 - x ≈ 0.1 - 1.8 x 10^-4 ≈ 0.09982 M\n[CH3COO-] ≈ 0.01 + x ≈ 0.01 + 1.8 x 10^-4 ≈ 0.01018 M\n[H3O+] ≈ x ≈ 1.8 x 10^-4 M\n\nSo, the new equilibrium concentrations are approximately:\n[CH3COOH] ≈ 0.09982 M\n[CH3COO-] ≈ 0.01018 M\n[H3O+] ≈ 1.8 x 10^-4 M"
