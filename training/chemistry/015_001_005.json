    "message_2": "To calculate the molecular orbitals and electronic structure of ethylene (C2H4) using the Huckel molecular orbital theory, we first need to consider the structure of ethylene. Ethylene consists of two carbon atoms (C) and four hydrogen atoms (H). The carbon atoms are sp2 hybridized, and each carbon atom forms a sigma bond with two hydrogen atoms and one with the other carbon atom. Additionally, there is a pi bond between the two carbon atoms.\n\nIn the Huckel molecular orbital theory, we only consider the pi electrons and pi orbitals. For ethylene, there are two pi electrons, one from each carbon atom. We will use the Huckel secular determinant to find the molecular orbitals.\n\nThe secular determinant for ethylene is:\n\n| α - E    β |\n| β    α - E |\n\nWhere α is the Coulomb integral (diagonal elements), β is the resonance integral (off-diagonal elements), and E is the molecular orbital energy.\n\nTo solve for the molecular orbital energies (E), we set the determinant equal to zero and solve for E:\n\n(α - E)(α - E) - β² = 0\n\nExpanding and simplifying the equation, we get:\n\nE² - 2αE + α² - β² = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can use the quadratic formula to solve for E:\n\nE = (2α ± √(4α² - 4(α² - β²))) / 2\n\nSimplifying further:\n\nE = α ± β\n\nSo, we have two molecular orbital energies: E1 = α + β and E2 = α - β.\n\nNow, we can determine the coefficients of the molecular orbitals by plugging the energies back into the secular determinant:\n\nFor E1 (α + β):\n\n| α - (α + β)    β | = | -β    β |\n| β    α - (α + β) |   | β   -β |\n\nC1 = C2 (normalized)\n\nψ1 = (1/√2)(φ1 + φ2)\n\nFor E2 (α - β):\n\n| α - (α - β)    β | = | β    β |\n| β    α - (α - β) |   | β   β |\n\nC1 = -C2 (normalized)\n\nψ2 = (1/√2)(φ1 - φ2)\n\nIn conclusion, the molecular orbitals and electronic structure of ethylene (C2H4) using the Huckel molecular orbital theory are:\n\nψ1 = (1/√2)(φ1 + φ2) with energy E1 = α + β\nψ2 = (1/√2)(φ1 - φ2) with energy E2 = α - β\n\nSince there are two pi electrons in ethylene, both electrons will occupy the lower energy molecular orbital (ψ1)."
