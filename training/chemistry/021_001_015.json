    "message_2": "When a metal atom combines with a non-metal atom, an ionic bond is formed. In an ionic bond, the metal atom loses one or more electrons to become a positively charged ion (cation), while the non-metal atom gains one or more electrons to become a negatively charged ion (anion). The electrostatic attraction between these oppositely charged ions holds them together in the ionic bond.\n\nTo determine the type of bond between two atoms using electronegativity values, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the electronegativity values of both atoms involved in the bond. Electronegativity is a measure of an atom's ability to attract electrons in a chemical bond. You can find these values in a periodic table or other chemistry reference materials.\n\n2. Calculate the difference in electronegativity values between the two atoms.\n\n3. Use the difference in electronegativity values to determine the type of bond:\n\n   a. If the difference is greater than or equal to 1.7, the bond is considered ionic.\n   b. If the difference is between 0.4 and 1.7, the bond is considered polar covalent, which means that the electrons are shared unequally between the two atoms.\n   c. If the difference is less than 0.4, the bond is considered nonpolar covalent, which means that the electrons are shared more or less equally between the two atoms.\n\nKeep in mind that these are general guidelines, and there may be some exceptions or borderline cases."
