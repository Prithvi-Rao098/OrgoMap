    "message_2": "The balanced chemical equation for the preparation of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene from nitrobenzene and chlorine gas is:\n\nC6H5NO2 + 2 Cl2 → C6H3Cl2NO2 + 2 HCl\n\nTo calculate the theoretical yield of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene, we first need to determine the number of moles of nitrobenzene. The molecular weight of nitrobenzene (C6H5NO2) is approximately 123.11 g/mol. \n\nGiven that we have 10 grams of nitrobenzene, we can calculate the number of moles as follows:\n\nmoles of nitrobenzene = mass / molecular weight\nmoles of nitrobenzene = 10 g / 123.11 g/mol ≈ 0.0812 mol\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1 (1 mole of nitrobenzene reacts with 2 moles of Cl2 to produce 1 mole of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene), the number of moles of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene produced will be the same as the number of moles of nitrobenzene reacted.\n\nmoles of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene = 0.0812 mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the theoretical yield of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene. The molecular weight of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene (C6H3Cl2NO2) is approximately 192.00 g/mol.\n\ntheoretical yield = moles of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene × molecular weight\ntheoretical yield = 0.0812 mol × 192.00 g/mol ≈ 15.59 g\n\nSo, the theoretical yield of 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene is approximately 15.59 grams."
