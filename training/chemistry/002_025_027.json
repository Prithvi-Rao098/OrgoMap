    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic moment of Fe(CO)₅ using Molecular Orbital Theory, we first need to determine the electron configuration of the complex.\n\nFe(CO)₅ is an octahedral complex with Fe as the central metal atom and CO as the ligands. The oxidation state of Fe in this complex is 0, and its electron configuration is [Ar] 3d^6 4s^2.\n\nCO is a strong field ligand, and it causes the pairing of electrons in the d orbitals of Fe. The Molecular Orbital Theory for octahedral complexes involves the splitting of the d orbitals into two sets: t₂g (lower energy) and e_g (higher energy). In the presence of strong field ligands, the electrons in the d orbitals will pair up in the lower energy t₂g orbitals.\n\nThe electron configuration of Fe in Fe(CO)₅ will be:\n\nt₂g^6 e_g^0\n\nSince all the electrons are paired, there are no unpaired electrons in the complex. The magnetic moment (μ) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nμ = √(n(n+2))\n\nwhere n is the number of unpaired electrons.\n\nIn this case, n = 0, so the magnetic moment of Fe(CO)₅ is:\n\nμ = √(0(0+2)) = 0\n\nTherefore, the magnetic moment of Fe(CO)₅ is 0, indicating that the complex is diamagnetic."
