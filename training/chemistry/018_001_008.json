    "message_2": "The reaction between hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and iodide ions (I-) is a classic example of a reaction with a known rate law expression. The overall reaction is:\n\nH2O2 + 2I- + 2H+ â†’ I2 + 2H2O\n\nThe rate law expression for this reaction is:\n\nRate = k[H2O2][I-]\n\nwhere Rate is the rate of the reaction, k is the rate constant, and [H2O2] and [I-] are the concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and iodide ions, respectively."
