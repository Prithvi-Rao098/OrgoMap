    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the combustion reaction of octane, we can use the following formula:\n\nΔH_combustion = Σ ΔHf_products - Σ ΔHf_reactants\n\nwhere ΔH_combustion is the standard enthalpy change for the combustion reaction, ΔHf_products are the standard enthalpies of formation for the products, and ΔHf_reactants are the standard enthalpies of formation for the reactants.\n\nFirst, let's find the total enthalpy of formation for the products:\n\n8 mol CO2 * (-394 kJ/mol CO2) + 9 mol H2O * (-286 kJ/mol H2O) = -3152 kJ + (-2574 kJ) = -5726 kJ\n\nNow, let's find the total enthalpy of formation for the reactants:\n\n1 mol C8H18 * (-249 kJ/mol C8H18) + 12.5 mol O2 * 0 kJ/mol O2 = -249 kJ + 0 kJ = -249 kJ\n\n(Note that the standard enthalpy of formation for O2 is 0 kJ/mol because it is in its standard state.)\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard enthalpy change for the combustion reaction:\n\nΔH_combustion = -5726 kJ - (-249 kJ) = -5726 kJ + 249 kJ = -5477 kJ\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change for the combustion reaction of octane is -5477 kJ."
