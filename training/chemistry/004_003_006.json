    "message_2": "As an AI language model, I cannot perform actual experiments or analyze experimental data. However, I can guide you through the process of identifying an unknown compound using mass spectrometry.\n\n1. Obtain the mass spectrum of the unknown compound: Run the sample through a mass spectrometer to obtain the mass spectrum. The mass spectrum will show the relative abundance of ions with different mass-to-charge ratios (m/z).\n\n2. Determine the molecular ion peak: Look for the peak with the highest m/z value in the mass spectrum. This peak corresponds to the molecular ion (M+) and represents the molecular weight of the compound.\n\n3. Calculate the molecular formula: Based on the molecular weight obtained from the molecular ion peak, you can deduce the molecular formula of the compound. You may need to consider different combinations of elements and their isotopes to find the most plausible molecular formula.\n\n4. Analyze the fragmentation pattern: The mass spectrum will also show peaks corresponding to fragment ions formed by the cleavage of the molecular ion. The fragmentation pattern can provide information about the structure of the compound. Look for characteristic fragment ions and neutral losses that can help you deduce the structural features of the compound.\n\n5. Compare the mass spectrum with reference spectra: If you have access to a mass spectral library, you can compare the mass spectrum of the unknown compound with reference spectra of known compounds. This can help you identify the compound or at least narrow down the possibilities.\n\n6. Confirm the structure using other analytical techniques: Once you have a tentative structure for the unknown compound, you can use other analytical techniques, such as infrared spectroscopy (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), or X-ray crystallography, to confirm the structure.\n\nPlease provide the mass spectrum data or any other relevant information about the unknown compound for further assistance."
