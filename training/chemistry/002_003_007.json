    "message_2": "To determine the solubility of calcium sulfate (CaSO4) in water, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the dissolution of CaSO4:\n\nCaSO4 (s) ⇌ Ca²⁺ (aq) + SO₄²⁻ (aq)\n\nFrom the given information, the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions in a saturated solution is 4.7 x 10⁻⁵ mol/L. Since the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, the concentration of SO₄²⁻ ions will also be 4.7 x 10⁻⁵ mol/L.\n\nNow, we need to convert the molar concentration of CaSO4 into grams per liter. To do this, we first need to find the molar mass of CaSO4:\n\nMolar mass of CaSO4 = (40.08 g/mol for Ca) + (32.07 g/mol for S) + (4 x 16.00 g/mol for O)\nMolar mass of CaSO4 = 40.08 + 32.07 + 64.00 = 136.15 g/mol\n\nNow, we can convert the molar concentration of CaSO4 into grams per liter:\n\nSolubility of CaSO4 = (4.7 x 10⁻⁵ mol/L) x (136.15 g/mol) = 0.0064 g/L\n\nTherefore, the solubility of calcium sulfate (CaSO4) in water at constant temperature and pressure is approximately 0.0064 grams per liter."
