    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of stoichiometry and the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and hydrochloric acid (HCl):\n\nNaOH + HCl → NaCl + H₂O\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that the mole ratio between NaOH and HCl is 1:1.\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of HCl used in the reaction:\n\nmoles of HCl = Molarity × Volume\nmoles of HCl = 0.100 M × 0.025 L (converting 25.00 mL to liters)\nmoles of HCl = 0.0025 moles\n\nSince the mole ratio between NaOH and HCl is 1:1, the moles of NaOH used in the reaction are also 0.0025 moles.\n\nNow, we can find the molarity of the NaOH solution:\n\nMolarity of NaOH = moles of NaOH / Volume of NaOH solution\nMolarity of NaOH = 0.0025 moles / 0.020 L (converting 20.00 mL to liters)\nMolarity of NaOH = 0.125 M\n\nSo, the molarity of the sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution is 0.125 M."
