    "message_2": "To find the concentration of hydrochloric acid (HCl) in the solution, we can use the concept of stoichiometry and the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between HCl and NaOH:\n\nHCl + NaOH → NaCl + H2O\n\nAt the equivalence point, the number of moles of HCl is equal to the number of moles of NaOH. We can use the formula:\n\nmoles = molarity × volume\n\nFirst, let's find the moles of NaOH:\n\nmoles of NaOH = molarity of NaOH × volume of NaOH\nmoles of NaOH = 0.10 M × 0.025 L (converting 25 mL to liters)\nmoles of NaOH = 0.0025 moles\n\nSince the moles of HCl are equal to the moles of NaOH at the equivalence point:\n\nmoles of HCl = 0.0025 moles\n\nNow, we can find the concentration of HCl using the formula:\n\nmolarity of HCl = moles of HCl / volume of HCl\n\nAssuming the volume of HCl is also 25 mL (0.025 L), we can calculate the molarity:\n\nmolarity of HCl = 0.0025 moles / 0.025 L\nmolarity of HCl = 0.10 M\n\nSo, the concentration of hydrochloric acid (HCl) in the solution is 0.10 M."
