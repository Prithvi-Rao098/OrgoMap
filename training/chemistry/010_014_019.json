    "message_2": "To find the mass of silver deposited on the cathode, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total charge passed through the solution.\n2. Determine the number of moles of electrons transferred.\n3. Calculate the number of moles of silver deposited.\n4. Find the mass of silver deposited.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total charge passed through the solution.\n\nCurrent (I) = 3.0 A\nTime (t) = 45 minutes = 45 × 60 = 2700 seconds\n\nTotal charge (Q) = Current × Time\nQ = 3.0 A × 2700 s\nQ = 8100 C\n\nStep 2: Determine the number of moles of electrons transferred.\n\nFaraday's constant (F) = 96500 C/mol\n\nMoles of electrons (n_e) = Total charge / Faraday's constant\nn_e = 8100 C / 96500 C/mol\nn_e = 0.0839 mol\n\nStep 3: Calculate the number of moles of silver deposited.\n\nThe reaction occurring at the cathode is:\nAg⁺ + e⁻ → Ag\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of silver ions (Ag⁺) requires 1 mole of electrons (e⁻) to be reduced to 1 mole of silver atoms (Ag). Therefore, the number of moles of silver deposited is equal to the number of moles of electrons transferred.\n\nMoles of silver (n_Ag) = Moles of electrons (n_e)\nn_Ag = 0.0839 mol\n\nStep 4: Find the mass of silver deposited.\n\nMolar mass of silver (M_Ag) = 107.87 g/mol\n\nMass of silver (m_Ag) = Moles of silver × Molar mass of silver\nm_Ag = 0.0839 mol × 107.87 g/mol\nm_Ag = 9.05 g\n\nSo, the mass of silver deposited on the cathode is 9.05 grams."
