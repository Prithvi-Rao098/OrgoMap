    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to manipulate the given equations so that they can be combined to form the target equation. \n\nTarget equation: 4NH3(g) + 7O2(g) → 4NO2(g) + 6H2O(g)\n\nFirst, we need to reverse Equation 3 and multiply it by 2 to get 4NH3 on the reactant side:\n\nReversed and multiplied Equation 3: 4NH3(g) → 2N2(g) + 6H2(g), ∆H = 2 * 91.8 kJ/mol = 183.6 kJ/mol\n\nNext, we need to multiply Equation 1 by 3 to get 6H2O on the product side:\n\nMultiplied Equation 1: 6H2(g) + 3O2(g) → 6H2O(g), ∆H = 3 * (-483.7 kJ/mol) = -1451.1 kJ/mol\n\nFinally, we need to multiply Equation 2 by 2 to get 4NO2 on the product side:\n\nMultiplied Equation 2: 4NO2(g) + 2O2(g) → 4NO3(g), ∆H = 2 * (-197.1 kJ/mol) = -394.2 kJ/mol\n\nNow we can add the modified equations together:\n\n4NH3(g) → 2N2(g) + 6H2(g) + 6H2(g) + 3O2(g) → 6H2O(g) + 4NO2(g) + 2O2(g) → 4NO3(g)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n4NH3(g) + 7O2(g) → 4NO2(g) + 6H2O(g)\n\nNow, we can add the enthalpy changes of the modified equations:\n\n∆H_total = 183.6 kJ/mol + (-1451.1 kJ/mol) + (-394.2 kJ/mol) = -1661.7 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the enthalpy change for the target reaction is -1661.7 kJ/mol."
