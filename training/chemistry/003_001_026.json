The equation for the combustion of methane is:\n\nCH4 (g) + 2O2 (g) → CO2 (g) + 2H2O (l) \n\nGiven the standard enthalpies of formation at 25°C are:\n\nΔHf[CH4 (g)] = -74.87 kJ/mol \n\nΔHf[CO2 (g)] = -393.5 kJ/mol \n\nΔHf[H2O (l)] = -285.8 kJ/mol \n\nAssume that water is in its liquid phase at the end of the reaction.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the change in enthalpy (ΔH) for the combustion of methane, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH = Σ ΔHf(products) - Σ ΔHf(reactants)\n\nFor the given reaction, the products are CO2 (g) and 2H2O (l), and the reactants are CH4 (g) and 2O2 (g). The standard enthalpies of formation for O2 (g) are zero because it is in its standard state.\n\nΔH = [1 × ΔHf(CO2) + 2 × ΔHf(H2O)] - [1 × ΔHf(CH4) + 2 × ΔHf(O2)]\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nΔH = [1 × (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 × (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [1 × (-74.87 kJ/mol) + 2 × (0 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH = (-393.5 kJ/mol - 571.6 kJ/mol) - (-74.87 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH = -965.1 kJ/mol + 74.87 kJ/mol\n\nΔH = -890.23 kJ/mol\n\nThe change in enthalpy (ΔH) for the combustion of methane gas (CH4) at 25°C and constant pressure of 1 atm is approximately -890.23 kJ/mol."
