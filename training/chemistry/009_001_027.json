    "message_1": "A sample of Uranium-238 has an initial activity of 3200 counts per minute (cpm). Calculate the activity of the sample after 2 half-lives. Given that the half-life of uranium-238 is 4.5 billion years.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the activity of the sample after 2 half-lives, we can use the formula:\n\nFinal activity = Initial activity * (1/2)^n\n\nwhere n is the number of half-lives.\n\nIn this case, the initial activity is 3200 cpm, and we want to find the activity after 2 half-lives.\n\nFinal activity = 3200 * (1/2)^2\nFinal activity = 3200 * (1/4)\nFinal activity = 3200 * 0.25\nFinal activity = 800 cpm\n\nSo, the activity of the sample after 2 half-lives will be 800 counts per minute."
