    "message_2": "The bond angle of a water molecule (H2O) is approximately 104.5 degrees. This value can be determined using quantum chemistry calculations, such as ab initio or density functional theory (DFT) methods, which take into account the electronic structure of the molecule and the interactions between the electrons and nuclei.\n\nThe predicted bond angle for a water molecule, based on the valence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory, is 109.5 degrees. This is the bond angle for a tetrahedral geometry, which is the arrangement of electron pairs around the central oxygen atom in water. However, the actual bond angle is smaller than the predicted value.\n\nThe deviation from the predicted bond angle can be explained by the presence of two lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen atom in the water molecule. These lone pairs occupy more space than the bonding electron pairs, causing a greater repulsion between the lone pairs and the bonding pairs. This results in the bonding pairs being pushed closer together, which decreases the bond angle to the observed value of 104.5 degrees.\n\nQuantum chemistry calculations, such as those mentioned earlier, can provide a more accurate bond angle value by accounting for these electronic effects and other factors that influence the molecular geometry."
