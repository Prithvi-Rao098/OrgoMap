    "message_2": "To calculate the formal charge of the nitrogen atom in the ammonium ion (NH4+), we can use the following formula:\n\nFormal charge = (Valence electrons of the atom) - (Non-bonding electrons) - (1/2 * Bonding electrons)\n\nFor nitrogen, the number of valence electrons is 5. In the ammonium ion, nitrogen is bonded to four hydrogen atoms, and each bond consists of 2 electrons (1 from nitrogen and 1 from hydrogen). There are no non-bonding electrons on nitrogen in this case, as all of its valence electrons are involved in bonding.\n\nNow, let's plug these values into the formula:\n\nFormal charge = (5) - (0) - (1/2 * 8)\nFormal charge = 5 - 0 - 4\nFormal charge = +1\n\nSo, the formal charge of the nitrogen atom in the ammonium ion (NH4+) is +1. This is consistent with the overall charge of the ion, which is also +1."
