    "message_1": "What will be the effect on the solubility of lead (II) chloride (PbCl2) when we add NaCl solution to it? Calculate the new solubility of PbCl2 if 0.1 mol of NaCl is added to a saturated solution containing 0.2 mol of PbCl2 at a particular temperature. Given that the solubility product constant (Ksp) of PbCl2 is 1.6 x 10^-5 at the same temperature.",
    "message_2": "When NaCl is added to a saturated solution of PbCl2, the solubility of PbCl2 will decrease due to the common ion effect. The common ion effect states that the solubility of a sparingly soluble salt is decreased when a soluble salt with a common ion is added to the solution.\n\nTo calculate the new solubility of PbCl2, we can use the solubility product constant (Ksp) and the concentrations of the ions in the solution.\n\nThe dissociation of PbCl2 can be represented as:\nPbCl2 (s) ⇌ Pb²⁺ (aq) + 2Cl⁻ (aq)\n\nThe Ksp expression for PbCl2 is:\nKsp = [Pb²⁺] [Cl⁻]²\n\nGiven that the Ksp of PbCl2 is 1.6 x 10^-5 at the same temperature.\n\nLet the new solubility of PbCl2 be x mol/L. Then, the concentration of Pb²⁺ ions in the solution will be x mol/L, and the concentration of Cl⁻ ions will be 2x mol/L from the dissociation of PbCl2 plus 0.1 mol/L from the added NaCl.\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the Ksp expression:\n\n1.6 x 10^-5 = (x) (2x + 0.1)²\n\nTo solve for x, we can first simplify the equation:\n\n1.6 x 10^-5 = (x) (4x² + 0.4x + 0.01)\n\nNow, we can solve the quadratic equation:\n\n4x³ + 0.4x² + 0.01x - 1.6 x 10^-5 = 0\n\nSolving this equation for x using either factoring, completing the square, or a numerical method (such as the Newton-Raphson method) yields:\n\nx ≈ 1.24 x 10^-3 mol/L\n\nSo, the new solubility of PbCl2 in the presence of 0.1 mol of NaCl is approximately 1.24 x 10^-3 mol/L, which is lower than the initial solubility of 0.2 mol/L."
