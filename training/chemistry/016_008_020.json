    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat energy needed to melt the ice cube, we can use the formula:\n\nq = n * ΔHf\n\nwhere q is the heat energy, n is the number of moles of the substance, and ΔHf is the enthalpy of fusion.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles (n) of the ice cube. The molar mass of water is 18.015 g/mol. \n\nn = mass / molar mass\nn = 25 g / 18.015 g/mol\nn ≈ 1.387 moles\n\nNow, we can use the formula to find the heat energy needed:\n\nq = n * ΔHf\nq = 1.387 moles * 6.01 kJ/mol\nq ≈ 8.34 kJ\n\nSo, the amount of heat energy needed to melt the 25-g ice cube at its melting point of 0°C is approximately 8.34 kJ."
