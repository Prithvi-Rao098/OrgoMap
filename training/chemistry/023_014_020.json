    "message_2": "To find the molecular weight of 4-bromoacetanilide, we first need to determine its molecular formula. The molecular formula of 4-bromoacetanilide is C8H8BrNO.\n\nNow, let's calculate the molecular weight using the atomic weights of each element:\n\nCarbon (C) = 12.01 g/mol\nHydrogen (H) = 1.01 g/mol\nBromine (Br) = 79.90 g/mol\nNitrogen (N) = 14.01 g/mol\nOxygen (O) = 16.00 g/mol\n\nMolecular weight of 4-bromoacetanilide = (8 × 12.01) + (8 × 1.01) + (1 × 79.90) + (1 × 14.01) + (1 × 16.00) = 96.08 + 8.08 + 79.90 + 14.01 + 16.00 = 214.07 g/mol\n\nTo determine the yield of the reaction, we need to know the amount of starting material (acetanilide) and the amount of product (4-bromoacetanilide) obtained. The yield can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nYield (%) = (Actual amount of product obtained / Theoretical amount of product) × 100\n\nHowever, without the actual amounts of starting material and product obtained, it is not possible to calculate the yield of the reaction."
