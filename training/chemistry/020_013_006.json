    "message_1": "What is the numerical value of the equilibrium constant for the following reaction where acetic acid (HC₂H₃O₂) is ionized to form the acetate ion (C₂H₃O₂⁻) and hydronium ion (H₃O⁺)?\n\nHC₂H₃O₂ + H₂O ⇋ C₂H₃O₂⁻ + H₃O⁺\n\nThe value of ionization constant (K_a) of acetic acid is 1.8 x 10⁻⁵ at 25°C.",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (K_c) for the reaction, we need to use the ionization constant (K_a) of acetic acid. The given reaction is:\n\nHC₂H₃O₂ + H₂O ⇋ C₂H₃O₂⁻ + H₃O⁺\n\nThe K_a expression for this reaction is:\n\nK_a = [C₂H₃O₂⁻][H₃O⁺] / [HC₂H₃O₂]\n\nSince the concentration of water (H₂O) remains constant, we can combine it with K_a to find the equilibrium constant (K_c) for the reaction:\n\nK_c = K_a × [H₂O]\n\nHowever, in dilute aqueous solutions, the concentration of water is considered constant and is not included in the equilibrium constant expression. Therefore, in this case, K_c is equal to K_a:\n\nK_c = K_a = 1.8 x 10⁻⁵\n\nSo, the numerical value of the equilibrium constant (K_c) for the reaction is 1.8 x 10⁻⁵."
