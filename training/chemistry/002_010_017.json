    "message_2": "To find the density of zinc oxide, we can use the formula:\n\nDensity = mass/volume\n\nGiven the mass of the sample is 25 grams and the volume it occupies is 12.5 mL, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nDensity = 25 g / 12.5 mL\n\nDensity = 2 g/mL\n\nSo, the density of zinc oxide at 25°C is 2 g/mL."
