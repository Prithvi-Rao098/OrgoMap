    "message_2": "The standard enthalpy change for the formation of 1 mole of carbon dioxide (CO2) gas from solid elemental carbon (C) and gaseous molecular oxygen (O2) at 298 K can be found using the standard enthalpy of formation values for the substances involved in the reaction.\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) is the change in enthalpy when 1 mole of a substance is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states at 298 K and 1 atm pressure. For elemental carbon (C) and molecular oxygen (O2), the standard enthalpy of formation is zero because they are in their standard states.\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation for carbon dioxide (CO2) gas is -393.5 kJ/mol.\n\nUsing the balanced chemical equation: C(s) + O2(g) → CO2(g), we can calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reaction (ΔH°) using the following formula:\n\nΔH° = Σ [ΔHf°(products)] - Σ [ΔHf°(reactants)]\n\nΔH° = [1 mol × (-393.5 kJ/mol)] - [1 mol × 0 kJ/mol + 1 mol × 0 kJ/mol]\n\nΔH° = -393.5 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the formation of 1 mole of carbon dioxide (CO2) gas from solid elemental carbon (C) and gaseous molecular oxygen (O2) at 298 K is -393.5 kJ/mol."
