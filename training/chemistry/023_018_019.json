    "message_2": "To calculate the yield of 2,4-dinitrophenol, we first need to determine the theoretical yield based on the stoichiometry of the reaction and then apply the percentage yield.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nC6H5OH (phenol) + 2 HNO3 (nitric acid) → C6H3N2O5 (2,4-dinitrophenol) + 2 H2O (water)\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of phenol reacts with 2 moles of nitric acid to produce 1 mole of 2,4-dinitrophenol.\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of phenol used in the reaction:\n\nMoles of phenol = mass of phenol / molar mass of phenol\nMoles of phenol = 10 g / (94.11 g/mol) = 0.1063 mol\n\nSince 1 mole of phenol produces 1 mole of 2,4-dinitrophenol, the theoretical yield of 2,4-dinitrophenol is also 0.1063 mol.\n\nNow, we need to convert the moles of 2,4-dinitrophenol to grams:\n\nMass of 2,4-dinitrophenol = moles of 2,4-dinitrophenol × molar mass of 2,4-dinitrophenol\nMass of 2,4-dinitrophenol = 0.1063 mol × (184.11 g/mol) = 19.56 g (theoretical yield)\n\nFinally, we apply the percentage yield to find the actual yield:\n\nActual yield = theoretical yield × percentage yield\nActual yield = 19.56 g × 0.95 = 18.58 g\n\nSo, the yield of 2,4-dinitrophenol obtained in the preparation is 18.58 grams."
