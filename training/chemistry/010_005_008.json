    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant (K) for the given reaction, we first need to determine the standard cell potential (E°cell) for the reaction. The cell potential can be calculated using the Nernst equation:\n\nE°cell = E°(cathode) - E°(anode)\n\nIn this case, the Cu2+/Cu half-cell acts as the anode (oxidation) and the Ag+/Ag half-cell acts as the cathode (reduction). Therefore, we can plug in the given electrode potentials:\n\nE°cell = E°(Ag+/Ag) - E°(Cu2+/Cu) = 0.80 V - 0.34 V = 0.46 V\n\nNow that we have the standard cell potential, we can calculate the equilibrium constant (K) using the relationship between E°cell and the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°):\n\nΔG° = -nFE°cell\n\nWhere n is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the reaction (in this case, n = 2), F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol), and ΔG° is the standard Gibbs free energy change.\n\nWe can also relate the Gibbs free energy change to the equilibrium constant (K) using the following equation:\n\nΔG° = -RTln(K)\n\nWhere R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K) and T is the temperature in Kelvin (assuming 298 K for standard conditions).\n\nBy combining these two equations, we can solve for K:\n\n-RTln(K) = -nFE°cell\n\nln(K) = (nFE°cell) / RT\n\nK = e^((nFE°cell) / RT)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nK = e^((2 * 96485 * 0.46) / (8.314 * 298))\nK ≈ 1.1 × 10^10\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium constant (K) for the given reaction is approximately 1.1 × 10^10."
