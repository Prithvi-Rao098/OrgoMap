    "message_2": "To prepare 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid from benzoic acid and nitric acid, you can follow the nitration reaction using a nitrating mixture of concentrated nitric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid. Here's the step-by-step procedure:\n\n1. Reactant quantities:\n- 10 g of benzoic acid (C7H6O2)\n- 30 mL of concentrated nitric acid (HNO3, 65%)\n- 30 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 98%)\n\n2. Reaction conditions:\n- Temperature: 0-10째C (ice bath)\n- Time: 1-2 hours\n\n3. Procedure:\na. Set up an ice bath to maintain the temperature between 0-10째C.\nb. In a 250 mL round-bottom flask, dissolve 10 g of benzoic acid in 30 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid. Stir the mixture until a homogeneous solution is obtained.\nc. Slowly and carefully add 30 mL of concentrated nitric acid to the benzoic acid-sulfuric acid mixture while stirring. Make sure the temperature remains between 0-10째C during the addition.\nd. After the addition is complete, continue stirring the reaction mixture in the ice bath for 1-2 hours.\ne. Carefully pour the reaction mixture onto crushed ice and stir until the ice melts. The 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid will precipitate out of the solution.\nf. Filter the precipitate using vacuum filtration and wash it with cold water to remove any remaining acid.\ng. Recrystallize the crude product from a suitable solvent, such as ethanol or a mixture of ethanol and water, to obtain pure 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid.\n\n4. Confirming the purity of the final product:\na. Melting point determination: The melting point of pure 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid is around 241-243째C. If the obtained product has a melting point within this range, it indicates a high degree of purity.\nb. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC): Perform TLC analysis using an appropriate solvent system (e.g., ethyl acetate:hexane) to check for the presence of any impurities or unreacted starting material.\nc. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy: Analyze the product using IR spectroscopy to confirm the presence of characteristic functional groups and the absence of any impurities.\nd. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy: Obtain 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the product to confirm its structure and purity.\n\nRemember to always follow safety precautions and wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) when handling chemicals and performing reactions."
