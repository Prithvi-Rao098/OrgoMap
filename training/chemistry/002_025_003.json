    "message_2": "The magnetic moment of a complex can be calculated using the formula:\n\nμ = √(n(n+2)) BM (Bohr Magneton)\n\nwhere n is the number of unpaired electrons.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the oxidation state of Fe in the [Fe(H2O)6]+3 complex. The overall charge of the complex is +3, and since H2O is a neutral ligand, the oxidation state of Fe is +3.\n\nFe in its ground state has the electron configuration [Ar] 3d^6 4s^2. In the +3 oxidation state, it loses 3 electrons, resulting in the electron configuration [Ar] 3d^5.\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of unpaired electrons in the 3d orbitals. In the high-spin state, Fe(III) has 5 unpaired electrons (one in each 3d orbital). In the low-spin state, Fe(III) has only one unpaired electron, as the other electrons are paired up in the lower energy 3d orbitals.\n\nFor [Fe(H2O)6]+3, the complex is octahedral and H2O is a weak field ligand, which means it will not cause significant splitting of the d orbitals. Therefore, the complex will be in the high-spin state with 5 unpaired electrons.\n\nNow we can calculate the magnetic moment:\n\nμ = √(n(n+2)) BM\nμ = √(5(5+2)) BM\nμ = √(5(7)) BM\nμ = √(35) BM ≈ 5.92 BM\n\nSo, the magnetic moment of [Fe(H2O)6]+3 is approximately 5.92 Bohr magnetons."
