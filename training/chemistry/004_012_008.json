    "message_2": "To determine the percentage composition (by mass) of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen in a given organic compound using elemental analysis, you will need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Obtain the mass of the sample: First, you need to know the mass of the organic compound you are analyzing. This can be obtained by weighing the sample using a high-precision balance.\n\n2. Perform elemental analysis: Elemental analysis is a technique used to determine the elemental composition of a compound. There are several methods to perform elemental analysis, such as combustion analysis, mass spectrometry, or X-ray fluorescence. Choose an appropriate method based on the available equipment and the nature of the compound.\n\n3. Obtain the mass of each element: After performing the elemental analysis, you will obtain the mass of each element (carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen) present in the sample.\n\n4. Calculate the percentage composition: To find the percentage composition (by mass) of each element, divide the mass of the element by the total mass of the sample and multiply by 100.\n\nPercentage composition (by mass) of an element = (Mass of the element / Total mass of the sample) Ã— 100\n\n5. Repeat the calculations for each element (carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen) to obtain their respective percentage compositions in the organic compound.\n\nKeep in mind that the sum of the percentage compositions of all elements in the compound should be close to 100%. If there are other elements present in the compound, their percentage compositions should also be considered."
