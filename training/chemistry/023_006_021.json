    "message_2": "To synthesize phenylalanine from benzyl chloride and ammonia, you can follow the Strecker amino acid synthesis. However, you will need an additional reagent, namely an aldehyde or a ketone. In the case of phenylalanine synthesis, you will need benzaldehyde. Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. React benzaldehyde with ammonia to form an imine intermediate.\n   Benzaldehyde + NH3 → C6H5CH=NH\n\n2. React the imine intermediate with benzyl chloride (as a cyanide source) to form an α-aminonitrile.\n   C6H5CH=NH + ClCH2CN → C6H5CH(NH2)CN\n\n3. Hydrolyze the α-aminonitrile to obtain phenylalanine.\n   C6H5CH(NH2)CN + 2H2O → C6H5CH(NH2)COOH + NH3\n\nSpecific conditions for the reaction:\n\n1. Temperature: The reaction can be carried out at room temperature (25°C) or slightly above, depending on the reagents' solubility and reaction rate.\n\n2. Pressure: Atmospheric pressure is suitable for this reaction.\n\n3. Solvent: A polar solvent like water or a mixture of water and an organic solvent (e.g., ethanol) can be used.\n\n4. Catalyst: An acid or base catalyst can be used to speed up the reaction. For example, a mild base like sodium cyanide (NaCN) can be used to facilitate the formation of the imine intermediate and the α-aminonitrile.\n\nPlease note that benzyl chloride is a toxic and lachrymatory compound, and the reaction should be performed in a well-ventilated area or a fume hood. Additionally, cyanide compounds are highly toxic, and proper safety precautions should be taken when handling them."
