    "message_2": "The standard enthalpy change of neutralization for the reaction between hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is given as -57.1 kJ/mol. This value represents the amount of heat released when 1 mole of HCl reacts with 1 mole of NaOH to form 1 mole of water and 1 mole of sodium chloride (NaCl) under standard conditions.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nHCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) â†’ H2O(l) + NaCl(aq)\n\nSince the heat of reaction is given for the neutralization of 1 mole of HCl and 1 mole of NaOH, the standard enthalpy change of neutralization for this reaction is -57.1 kJ/mol."
