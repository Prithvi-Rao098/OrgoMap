    "message_2": "This reaction is an example of a nucleophilic substitution reaction, specifically an SN2 reaction. In this case, the nucleophile is the hydroxide ion (OH-) provided by the potassium hydroxide (KOH), and the electrophile is the alkyl bromide (CH3CH2CH2-Br).\n\nMechanism of the reaction:\n\n1. The hydroxide ion (OH-) attacks the electrophilic carbon atom (the one bonded to the bromine) from the backside, opposite to the leaving group (Br-). This results in the formation of a transition state where the carbon is partially bonded to both the hydroxide and the bromine.\n\n2. As the bond between the carbon and the hydroxide strengthens, the bond between the carbon and the bromine weakens, and the bromide ion (Br-) leaves as a leaving group.\n\n3. The final product is formed when the bond between the carbon and the hydroxide is fully formed, and the bromide ion has completely left.\n\nBased on this mechanism, the major product of this reaction is the substitution of the bromine atom with the hydroxide group, resulting in the formation of an alcohol:\n\n    CH3CH2CH2-OH (1-propanol)\n\nThere is no rearrangement in this reaction, as the SN2 mechanism involves a direct substitution without the formation of any carbocation intermediates that could undergo rearrangement."
