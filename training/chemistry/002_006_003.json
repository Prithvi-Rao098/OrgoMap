    "message_2": "To find the molar mass of calcium nitrate [Ca(NO3)2], we need to determine the molar mass of each element in the compound and then add them together.\n\nCalcium (Ca): 1 atom × 40.08 g/mol = 40.08 g/mol\nNitrogen (N): 2 atoms × 14.01 g/mol = 28.02 g/mol (since there are 2 nitrate ions, each containing 1 nitrogen atom)\nOxygen (O): 6 atoms × 16.00 g/mol = 96.00 g/mol (since there are 2 nitrate ions, each containing 3 oxygen atoms)\n\nNow, add the molar masses of each element together:\n\n40.08 g/mol (Ca) + 28.02 g/mol (N) + 96.00 g/mol (O) = 164.10 g/mol\n\nSo, the molar mass of calcium nitrate [Ca(NO3)2] is 164.10 g/mol."
