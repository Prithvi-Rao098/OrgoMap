    "message_2": "To develop an optimal process for the production of adhesives with high bonding strength, low toxicity, and cost-effectiveness, the following key parameters need to be optimized:\n\n1. Polymer selection: Choose the appropriate base polymer or blend of polymers that provide the desired bonding strength, flexibility, and chemical resistance. The polymer should also have low toxicity and be cost-effective.\n\n2. Crosslinking agents: Optimize the type and amount of crosslinking agents to achieve the desired bonding strength and durability. Crosslinking agents should be chosen based on their compatibility with the base polymer and their contribution to the overall adhesive performance.\n\n3. Adhesion promoters: Incorporate adhesion promoters or coupling agents to improve the adhesive's bonding strength to various substrates. These agents should be compatible with the base polymer and not contribute to toxicity.\n\n4. Fillers and additives: Optimize the use of fillers and additives to improve the adhesive's mechanical properties, thermal stability, and processability. These materials should be chosen based on their compatibility with the base polymer and their contribution to the overall adhesive performance.\n\n5. Solvents or carriers: Choose appropriate solvents or carriers that facilitate the application of the adhesive and promote good wetting of the substrate. The solvents should have low toxicity and be easily removed or evaporated during the curing process.\n\n6. Curing conditions: Optimize the curing temperature, time, and method (e.g., heat, UV, moisture) to achieve the desired bonding strength, durability, and adhesive performance.\n\n7. Processing methods: Develop efficient and cost-effective processing methods, such as extrusion, coating, or spray application, that ensure consistent adhesive quality and performance.\n\n8. Quality control: Implement robust quality control measures to monitor and maintain the adhesive's performance throughout the production process.\n\n9. Environmental and safety considerations: Ensure that the adhesive production process complies with environmental and safety regulations, including proper disposal of waste materials and minimizing the use of hazardous substances.\n\n10. Cost optimization: Continuously evaluate and optimize the cost of raw materials, processing methods, and other factors to maintain the adhesive's cost-effectiveness without compromising its performance."
