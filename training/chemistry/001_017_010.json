    "message_2": "The balanced chemical equation for the oxidation of ethanol (C2H5OH) to acetic acid (CH3COOH) is:\n\nC2H5OH + O2 â†’ CH3COOH + H2O\n\nNow, let's calculate the oxidation state of carbon in both reactants and the product.\n\nIn ethanol (C2H5OH):\n\n1. The oxidation state of hydrogen is +1.\n2. The oxidation state of oxygen is -2.\n3. Let the oxidation state of the carbon atoms be x.\n\nUsing the oxidation state rules, we can write the equation:\n\n2x + 6(+1) + (-2) = 0\n2x + 6 - 2 = 0\n2x = -4\nx = -2\n\nSo, the oxidation state of carbon in ethanol is -2.\n\nIn acetic acid (CH3COOH):\n\n1. The oxidation state of hydrogen is +1.\n2. The oxidation state of oxygen is -2.\n3. Let the oxidation state of the carbon atom in the CH3 group be x1 and the carbon atom in the COOH group be x2.\n\nUsing the oxidation state rules, we can write the equations:\n\nx1 + 3(+1) = 0\nx1 = -3\n\nx2 + 2(-2) + 1(+1) = 0\nx2 - 4 + 1 = 0\nx2 = 3\n\nSo, the oxidation state of carbon in the CH3 group of acetic acid is -3, and the oxidation state of carbon in the COOH group of acetic acid is +3."
