    "message_2": "The bond dissociation energy of methane (CH4) can be calculated using the given C-H bond energy. Methane has 4 C-H bonds, and we are given that the energy of one C-H bond is 413 kJ/mol. \n\nTo find the total bond dissociation energy of methane, we simply multiply the energy of one C-H bond by the number of C-H bonds in methane:\n\nBond dissociation energy of CH4 = (C-H bond energy) × (number of C-H bonds)\n= 413 kJ/mol × 4\n= 1652 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the bond dissociation energy of methane (CH4) is 1652 kJ/mol."
