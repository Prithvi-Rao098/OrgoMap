Use the following information: the polymerization rate at t=0 is 2×10^-4 mol/L·s and it doubles after 60 seconds.",
    "message_2": "To determine the rate constant (k) and the order of reaction (n) for the polymerization of styrene using the free-radical initiation mechanism, we can use the following rate law equation:\n\nrate = k [Styrene]^n [Initiator]^m\n\nwhere rate is the polymerization rate, k is the rate constant, [Styrene] is the concentration of styrene, n is the order of reaction with respect to styrene, [Initiator] is the concentration of the initiator, and m is the order of reaction with respect to the initiator.\n\nGiven that the polymerization rate doubles after 60 seconds, we can set up the following equation:\n\n2 × (2×10^-4 mol/L·s) = k [Styrene]^n [0.0025 mol/L]^m\n\nSolving for k:\n\nk = (4×10^-4 mol/L·s) / ([Styrene]^n [0.0025 mol/L]^m)\n\nNow, we need to determine the order of reaction (n) and the order of reaction with respect to the initiator (m). For free-radical polymerization, the overall order of reaction is typically 1 to 2. In this case, we will assume that the order of reaction with respect to the initiator (m) is 1, as it is common for free-radical polymerizations.\n\nTo determine the order of reaction with respect to styrene (n), we can use the fact that the rate doubles after 60 seconds. Assuming that the concentration of styrene remains relatively constant during this time, we can write:\n\n2 × rate = k [2 × Styrene]^n [0.0025 mol/L]\n\nDividing this equation by the initial rate equation, we get:\n\n2 = [2 × Styrene]^n / [Styrene]^n\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(2) = n × ln(2)\n\nn = 1\n\nNow that we have the order of reaction with respect to styrene (n) and the initiator (m), we can solve for the rate constant (k):\n\nk = (4×10^-4 mol/L·s) / ([Styrene]^1 [0.0025 mol/L]^1)\n\nk = (4×10^-4 mol/L·s) / (0.0025 mol/L)\n\nk = 1.6×10^-1 L/mol·s\n\nSo, the rate constant (k) for the polymerization of styrene using the free-radical initiation mechanism at 60°C and with an initiator concentration of 0.0025 mol/L is 1.6×10^-1 L/mol·s, and the order of reaction (n) is 1."
