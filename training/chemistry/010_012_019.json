    "message_2": "To determine the mass of copper deposited on the cathode, we can use Faraday's laws of electrolysis. The amount of substance deposited is directly proportional to the charge passed through the solution.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total charge passed through the solution. We can do this using the formula:\n\nCharge (Q) = Current (I) × Time (t)\n\nGiven, current (I) = 2.5 A and time (t) = 2 hours = 2 × 3600 seconds (since 1 hour = 3600 seconds)\n\nCharge (Q) = 2.5 A × 7200 s = 18,000 C\n\nNow, we can use Faraday's constant (F) to find the number of moles of copper deposited:\n\nNumber of moles (n) = Charge (Q) / (Faraday's constant × number of electrons involved in the reaction)\n\nFor the copper sulfate solution, the half-reaction at the cathode is:\n\nCu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu\n\nThis means that 2 moles of electrons are required to deposit 1 mole of copper.\n\nNumber of moles (n) = 18,000 C / (96,485 C/mol × 2) = 0.0933 mol\n\nFinally, we can find the mass of copper deposited using the atomic mass of copper (63.5 g/mol):\n\nMass of copper = Number of moles × Atomic mass\n\nMass of copper = 0.0933 mol × 63.5 g/mol = 5.92 g\n\nTherefore, the mass of copper deposited on the cathode is approximately 5.92 grams."
