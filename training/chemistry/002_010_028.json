    "message_2": "To find the density of a substance, we can use the formula:\n\nDensity = Mass / Volume\n\nGiven the mass (m) of sodium chloride (NaCl) is 5.6 g and its volume (V) is 2.3 mL, we can calculate its density (ρ) as follows:\n\nρ = m / V\nρ = 5.6 g / 2.3 mL\n\nρ ≈ 2.43 g/mL\n\nThe density of sodium chloride (NaCl) is approximately 2.43 g/mL."
