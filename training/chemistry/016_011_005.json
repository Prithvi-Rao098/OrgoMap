    "message_1": "What is the heat of mixing when 50 grams of water at 25 °C is mixed with 75 grams of ethanol at 25 °C? The specific heat of water is 4.184 J/g °C, the specific heat of ethanol is 2.44 J/g °C, and the heat of vaporization of ethanol is 38.56 kJ/mol. Assume that the volume of the mixture is the sum of the volumes of the individual components and that the density of the mixture is the sum of the densities of the individual components.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the heat of mixing, we need to find the final temperature of the mixture and then determine the heat exchanged by each component to reach that temperature. Since both water and ethanol are initially at the same temperature (25 °C), there will be no heat exchange between them upon mixing. Therefore, the heat of mixing in this case is 0 J."
