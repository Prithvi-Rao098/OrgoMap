    "message_2": "To understand how increasing the temperature affects the equilibrium constant (K) for the reaction N₂(g) + 3H₂(g) ⇌ 2NH₃(g), we need to consider the reaction's enthalpy change (ΔH). The formation of ammonia (NH₃) from nitrogen (N₂) and hydrogen (H₂) is an exothermic reaction, meaning it releases heat (ΔH < 0).\n\nAccording to Le Chatelier's principle, if a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in temperature, pressure, or concentration of reactants and products, the system will adjust its position to counteract the change. In the case of an exothermic reaction, increasing the temperature will shift the equilibrium position to favor the reverse (endothermic) reaction, which absorbs heat.\n\nAs a result, when the temperature is increased for the reaction N₂(g) + 3H₂(g) ⇌ 2NH₃(g), the equilibrium will shift to the left, favoring the decomposition of NH₃ into N₂ and H₂. Consequently, the equilibrium constant (K) will decrease.\n\nHowever, without specific information about the enthalpy change (ΔH) and the new temperature, we cannot calculate the exact value of the new equilibrium constant. But we can qualitatively conclude that increasing the temperature will decrease the equilibrium constant (K) for this exothermic reaction."
