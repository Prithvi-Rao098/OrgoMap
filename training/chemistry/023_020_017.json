    "message_1": "What is the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between benzoic acid and chlorine gas to produce 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid, and what is the limiting reagent in the reaction if 10 grams of benzoic acid and 20 grams of chlorine gas are mixed together? How much 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid can be produced in this reaction, and what is the percent yield if only 8 grams are obtained experimentally?",
    "message_2": "To find the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between benzoic acid and chlorine gas to produce 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid, we first need to write the unbalanced equation:\n\nC7H6O2 + Cl2 → C7H4Cl2O2\n\nNow, we balance the equation:\n\nC7H6O2 + 2Cl2 → C7H4Cl2O2\n\nThe balanced chemical equation is:\n\nC7H6O2 + 2Cl2 → C7H4Cl2O2\n\nNext, we need to find the limiting reagent. To do this, we'll use the stoichiometry of the balanced equation and the molar masses of the reactants.\n\nMolar mass of benzoic acid (C7H6O2) = 7(12.01) + 6(1.01) + 2(16.00) = 122.12 g/mol\nMoles of benzoic acid = 10 g / 122.12 g/mol = 0.0819 mol\n\nMolar mass of chlorine gas (Cl2) = 2(35.45) = 70.90 g/mol\nMoles of chlorine gas = 20 g / 70.90 g/mol = 0.282 mol\n\nNow, we'll compare the mole ratios of the reactants to determine the limiting reagent:\n\nMole ratio of benzoic acid to chlorine gas = 0.0819 mol / 0.282 mol = 0.290\n\nSince the balanced equation requires 1 mole of benzoic acid for every 2 moles of chlorine gas, the mole ratio should be 0.5 (1/2) for the reaction to proceed completely. Since the mole ratio is less than 0.5, benzoic acid is the limiting reagent.\n\nNow, we can find the theoretical yield of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid using the stoichiometry of the balanced equation:\n\nMoles of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid = 0.0819 mol (1 mol C7H4Cl2O2 / 1 mol C7H6O2) = 0.0819 mol\n\nMolar mass of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid (C7H4Cl2O2) = 7(12.01) + 4(1.01) + 2(35.45) + 2(16.00) = 197.00 g/mol\n\nTheoretical yield of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid = 0.0819 mol × 197.00 g/mol = 16.13 g\n\nFinally, we can calculate the percent yield:\n\nPercent yield = (experimental yield / theoretical yield) × 100\nPercent yield = (8 g / 16.13 g) × 100 = 49.6%"
