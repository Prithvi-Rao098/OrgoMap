How does this sequence determine the amino acid sequence of a protein during translation? What role do ribosomes and tRNA molecules play in this process? Can different codons code for the same amino acid? Give an example.",
    "message_2": "The primary structure of an mRNA molecule synthesized during transcription of a specific sequence of DNA bases is a single-stranded linear sequence of nucleotides. These nucleotides are composed of a nitrogenous base (adenine, uracil, cytosine, or guanine), a ribose sugar, and a phosphate group. The mRNA sequence is complementary to the template DNA strand and is synthesized in the 5' to 3' direction.\n\nThis mRNA sequence determines the amino acid sequence of a protein during translation through the genetic code, which is a set of rules that defines how the four-letter nucleotide sequence of mRNA is translated into the 20-letter amino acid sequence of proteins. The genetic code is read in groups of three nucleotides called codons. Each codon corresponds to a specific amino acid or a stop signal.\n\nRibosomes and tRNA molecules play crucial roles in the process of translation. Ribosomes are large molecular complexes that serve as the site of protein synthesis. They consist of two subunits, a large one and a small one, which come together to form a functional ribosome during translation. The ribosome reads the mRNA sequence and facilitates the formation of peptide bonds between amino acids to create a polypeptide chain.\n\ntRNA (transfer RNA) molecules are responsible for bringing the correct amino acids to the ribosome based on the codon sequence in the mRNA. Each tRNA molecule has a specific anticodon sequence that is complementary to a codon on the mRNA. The other end of the tRNA molecule is attached to the corresponding amino acid. As the ribosome moves along the mRNA, it matches the codons with the anticodons of tRNA molecules, and the amino acids are joined together to form the growing polypeptide chain. Once the ribosome reaches a stop codon, the translation process is terminated, and the completed protein is released.\n\nYes, different codons can code for the same amino acid. This phenomenon is known as degeneracy or redundancy of the genetic code. For example, the amino acid leucine can be coded by six different codons: UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, and CUG. This redundancy allows for some flexibility and error tolerance in the genetic code, as a single mutation in a codon may not necessarily lead to a change in the amino acid sequence of the protein."
