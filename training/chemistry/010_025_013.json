    "message_2": "To find the minimum potential required to increase the reaction rate by 10-fold, we can use the Arrhenius equation, which relates the rate constant (k) of a reaction to its activation energy (Ea) and temperature (T):\n\nk = A * exp(-Ea / (R * T))\n\nwhere A is the pre-exponential factor, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nSince we want a 10-fold increase in the reaction rate, we can set up the following equation:\n\nk2 / k1 = 10\n\nwhere k2 is the rate constant after applying the potential, and k1 is the initial rate constant.\n\nNow, we can express k2 and k1 in terms of the activation energy and temperature:\n\nk2 = A * exp(-Ea / (R * T))\nk1 = A * exp(-(Ea - qV) / (R * T))\n\nwhere q is the charge of an electron (1.602 x 10^-19 C), and V is the potential applied to the half-cell.\n\nDividing k2 by k1, we get:\n\n10 = exp((qV) / (R * T))\n\nNow, we can solve for V:\n\nV = (R * T * ln(10)) / q\n\nAssuming the reaction occurs at room temperature (25°C or 298.15 K), we can plug in the values:\n\nV = (8.314 J/mol·K * 298.15 K * ln(10)) / (1.602 x 10^-19 C)\n\nV ≈ 0.05916 V\n\nTherefore, the minimum potential that must be applied to the half-cell to observe a 10-fold increase in the reaction rate is approximately 0.05916 volts."
