    "message_2": "First, we need to write the expression for the equilibrium constant (K) for the given reaction:\n\nK = [Fe(OH)2][H+]^2 / ([Fe2+][H2O]^2)\n\nHowever, since Fe(OH)2 is a solid, its concentration does not change and is not included in the equilibrium expression. So, the expression becomes:\n\nK = [H+]^2 / ([Fe2+][H2O]^2)\n\nWe are given the solubility product constant (Ksp) for Fe(OH)2, which is 8.0 x 10^-10. The Ksp expression is:\n\nKsp = [Fe2+][OH-]^2\n\nWe can find the concentration of OH- ions using the Ksp expression and the given concentration of Fe2+ (0.025 M):\n\n8.0 x 10^-10 = (0.025)[OH-]^2\n[OH-]^2 = 3.2 x 10^-8\n[OH-] = 1.79 x 10^-4 M\n\nNow, we can use the relationship between [H+] and [OH-] to find the equilibrium constant (Kw):\n\nKw = [H+][OH-]\n1.0 x 10^-14 = (0.100)[OH-]\n[OH-] = 1.0 x 10^-13 M\n\nNow we can plug the given concentrations and the calculated [OH-] into the K expression:\n\nK = ([H+]^2) / ([Fe2+][H2O]^2)\nK = (0.100^2) / (0.025 x 55.5^2)\nK = 0.01 / (0.025 x 3080.25)\nK = 0.01 / 77.00625\nK = 1.30 x 10^-4\n\nThe equilibrium constant (K) for the given redox reaction is 1.30 x 10^-4."
