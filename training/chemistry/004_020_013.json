    "message_2": "As a chemist, I can help you analyze the presence of specific functional groups in Compound X using UV-Vis spectroscopy. However, I would need the actual UV-Vis spectrum data or a description of the absorption peaks to provide a detailed analysis. \n\nIn general, UV-Vis spectroscopy is a technique that measures the absorption of light by a compound in the ultraviolet and visible regions of the electromagnetic spectrum (200-800 nm). Different functional groups absorb light at specific wavelengths, which can be used to identify their presence in a compound.\n\nHere are some general guidelines for identifying functional groups based on their absorption peaks in the UV-Vis spectrum:\n\n1. Aromatic compounds: Absorb light in the range of 200-300 nm due to the presence of π-π* transitions in their conjugated systems.\n\n2. Conjugated alkenes and carbonyl compounds: Absorb light in the range of 300-400 nm due to the presence of n-π* and π-π* transitions.\n\n3. Nitro compounds: Absorb light in the range of 400-500 nm due to charge-transfer transitions.\n\n4. Metal complexes: Absorb light in the range of 400-800 nm due to d-d or charge-transfer transitions, depending on the metal and ligands involved.\n\nPlease provide the UV-Vis spectrum data or a description of the absorption peaks for Compound X, and I will be able to provide a more specific analysis of the functional groups present in the compound."
