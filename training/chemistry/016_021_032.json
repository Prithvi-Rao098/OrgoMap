    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat required to polymerize 2 moles of styrene into polystyrene, we can use the following formula:\n\nHeat (q) = moles (n) × enthalpy of polymerization (ΔH)\n\nGiven that the enthalpy of polymerization for styrene is -56 kJ/mol and the reaction is exothermic, the heat released during the polymerization of 1 mole of styrene is 56 kJ.\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat required to polymerize 2 moles of styrene:\n\nq = 2 moles × (-56 kJ/mol)\n\nq = -112 kJ\n\nSince the reaction is exothermic, the negative sign indicates that the heat is released during the polymerization process. Therefore, 112 kJ of heat is released when 2 moles of styrene are polymerized into polystyrene."
