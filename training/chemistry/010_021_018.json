    "message_2": "To calculate the corrosion potential of the zinc rod in a galvanic couple with a standard hydrogen electrode, we need to consider the half-cell reactions and the Nernst equation.\n\nThe half-cell reactions are:\n\nZn(s) → Zn²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ (E° = -0.76 V)\nCu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Cu(s) (E° = +0.34 V)\n\nThe overall reaction is:\nZn(s) + Cu²⁺(aq) → Zn²⁺(aq) + Cu(s)\n\nThe cell potential (E_cell) is the difference between the reduction potential of the cathode (copper) and the anode (zinc):\nE_cell = E°(Cu²⁺/Cu) - E°(Zn²⁺/Zn) = 0.34 V - (-0.76 V) = 1.10 V\n\nNow we need to apply the Nernst equation to account for the non-standard conditions (0.1 M Cu²⁺):\n\nE = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\n\nWhere:\nE = corrosion potential\nE° = standard cell potential\nR = gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\nT = temperature in Kelvin (25°C = 298 K)\nn = number of electrons transferred (2 for this reaction)\nF = Faraday's constant (96485 C/mol)\nQ = reaction quotient = [Zn²⁺]/[Cu²⁺]\n\nSince the zinc rod is being placed in the solution, we can assume that [Zn²⁺] is negligible compared to [Cu²⁺]. Therefore, Q ≈ 1/[Cu²⁺] = 1/0.1 = 10.\n\nNow we can plug in the values:\n\nE = 1.10 V - (8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K / (2 * 96485 C/mol)) * ln(10)\nE = 1.10 V - (0.0257 V) * ln(10)\nE = 1.10 V - 0.0592 V\nE ≈ 1.04 V\n\nThe corrosion potential of the zinc rod in a galvanic couple with a standard hydrogen electrode at 25°C is approximately 1.04 V."
