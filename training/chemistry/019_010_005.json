    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of methane gas (CH4), we need to consider the balanced chemical equation for the combustion reaction:\n\nCH4 (g) + 2 O2 (g) → CO2 (g) + 2 H2O (g)\n\nNow, we can use Hess's Law to determine the standard enthalpy change for the reaction. Hess's Law states that the enthalpy change for a reaction is equal to the sum of the enthalpy changes for the formation of the products minus the sum of the enthalpy changes for the formation of the reactants.\n\nΔH_combustion = [ΔH_formation(CO2) + 2 * ΔH_formation(H2O)] - [ΔH_formation(CH4) + 2 * ΔH_formation(O2)]\n\nSince O2 is in its standard state, its enthalpy of formation is 0 kJ/mol. Now, we can plug in the given values:\n\nΔH_combustion = [(-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 * (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [(-74.8 kJ/mol) + 2 * (0 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH_combustion = (-393.5 - 571.6 + 74.8) kJ/mol\n\nΔH_combustion = -890.3 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the combustion of methane gas (CH4) is -890.3 kJ/mol."
