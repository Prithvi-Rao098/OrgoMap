The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nCH4 (g) + 2O2 (g) → CO2 (g) + 2H2O (l)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of 1 mole of methane, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH_combustion = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH_combustion is the enthalpy change for the combustion, ΔH_f(products) is the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation for the products, and ΔH_f(reactants) is the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation for the reactants.\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\nCH4 (g) + 2O2 (g) → CO2 (g) + 2H2O (l)\n\nThe products are CO2 and 2H2O, and the reactants are CH4 and 2O2. The standard enthalpy of formation for O2 is 0 kJ/mol since it is in its elemental form.\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values into the equation:\n\nΔH_combustion = [(-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2(-241.8 kJ/mol)] - [(-74.8 kJ/mol) + 2(0 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH_combustion = (-393.5 - 483.6) - (-74.8)\n\nΔH_combustion = -877.1 + 74.8\n\nΔH_combustion = -802.3 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy change for the combustion of 1 mole of methane is -802.3 kJ/mol."
