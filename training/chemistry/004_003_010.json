    "message_2": "To identify the molecular formula and possible functional groups present in the unknown compound, we would first need to perform a mass spectrometry analysis on the sample. Mass spectrometry is an analytical technique that measures the mass-to-charge ratio of ions. It can provide information about the molecular weight and structure of the compound. Here's a general outline of the process:\n\n1. Obtain a sample of the unknown compound and prepare it for mass spectrometry analysis. This may involve dissolving the sample in a suitable solvent or converting it into a volatile form.\n\n2. Introduce the sample into the mass spectrometer. There are various ionization techniques, such as electron ionization (EI), electrospray ionization (ESI), or matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI), which can be used depending on the nature of the compound.\n\n3. The ionized sample is then accelerated through an electric or magnetic field, which separates the ions based on their mass-to-charge ratios. The separated ions are detected by a detector, and the resulting data is recorded as a mass spectrum.\n\n4. Analyze the mass spectrum to determine the molecular weight of the compound. The molecular ion peak (M+ or [M+H]+) represents the intact molecule and provides the molecular weight of the compound.\n\n5. Examine the fragmentation pattern in the mass spectrum to identify possible functional groups and structural features. Fragment ions can provide clues about the presence of specific functional groups, such as carbonyls, alcohols, amines, or halogens.\n\n6. Use the molecular weight and fragmentation pattern information to propose a molecular formula for the compound. This may involve comparing the mass spectrum data to known spectra in a mass spectral library or using software tools to generate possible molecular formulas.\n\n7. To further confirm the molecular formula and functional groups, additional analytical techniques, such as infrared spectroscopy (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), or X-ray crystallography, may be employed.\n\nPlease note that without the actual mass spectrum data, it is impossible to provide a specific molecular formula or functional groups for the unknown compound."
