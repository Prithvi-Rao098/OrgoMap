    "message_2": "To identify the resonance structures of the carbonate ion (CO₃²⁻), follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Determine the central atom\nIn the carbonate ion, the central atom is carbon (C), which is bonded to three oxygen (O) atoms.\n\nStep 2: Draw the Lewis structure\nThe Lewis structure for the carbonate ion is:\n       O\n       ||\nC - O - O⁻\n       -\nIn this structure, carbon has a double bond with one oxygen atom and single bonds with the other two oxygen atoms. Each singly bonded oxygen atom carries a negative charge, resulting in a total charge of 2- for the ion.\n\nStep 3: Identify possible resonance structures\nResonance structures occur when there is more than one possible way to distribute the electrons in a molecule or ion. In the case of the carbonate ion, the double bond between carbon and one of the oxygen atoms can be shifted to the other two oxygen atoms. This results in three possible resonance structures:\n\nStructure 1:\n       O\n       ||\nC - O - O⁻\n       -\n\nStructure 2:\nO⁻ - C - O\n       ||\n       O⁻\n\nStructure 3:\nO - C - O⁻\n  ||    |\n  O⁻\n\nStep 4: Verify that all resonance structures have the same number of electrons and obey the octet rule\nAll three resonance structures have the same number of electrons (24) and obey the octet rule, with each atom having a full outer shell of electrons.\n\nStep 5: Recognize that the actual structure is a hybrid of the resonance structures\nThe actual structure of the carbonate ion is a hybrid of the three resonance structures, with the double bond distributed equally among the three oxygen atoms. This results in a bond order of 4/3 (1.33) for each C-O bond, indicating that the bonds are somewhere between a single and double bond in character.\n\nIn summary, the carbonate ion (CO₃²⁻) has three resonance structures, with the double bond distributed equally among the three oxygen atoms. The actual structure is a hybrid of these resonance structures, with a bond order of 4/3 for each C-O bond."
