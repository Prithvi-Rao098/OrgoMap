    "message_2": "The bond order of the oxygen molecule (O2) can be determined using the molecular orbital theory. According to this theory, atomic orbitals combine to form molecular orbitals, which can be bonding, anti-bonding, or non-bonding. The bond order is calculated as the difference between the number of electrons in bonding orbitals and the number of electrons in anti-bonding orbitals, divided by 2.\n\nFor O2, the electronic configuration is:\n\n1s² 2s² 2p⁴\n\nWhen two oxygen atoms combine to form O2, the atomic orbitals overlap to create molecular orbitals. The molecular orbital configuration for O2 is:\n\nσ1s² σ*1s² σ2s² σ*2s² π2p⁴ σ*2p²\n\nHere, the asterisk (*) denotes anti-bonding orbitals.\n\nNow, let's calculate the bond order:\n\nBond order = (Number of electrons in bonding orbitals - Number of electrons in anti-bonding orbitals) / 2\n\nBond order = (2 + 2 + 4 - 2 - 2 - 2) / 2\n\nBond order = 2\n\nThe bond order of O2 is 2, which means there are two bonds between the two oxygen atoms. This bond order is associated with a double bond, which is relatively stable. The higher the bond order, the stronger and more stable the bond. In the case of O2, the bond order of 2 indicates that the molecule is stable and has a strong bond between the oxygen atoms."
