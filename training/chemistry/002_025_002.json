    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic moment of FeCl3 in its high spin state, we need to first find the number of unpaired electrons in the Fe3+ ion.\n\nIron(III) chloride has the chemical formula FeCl3, which means that the iron (Fe) atom has a +3 charge (Fe3+). The electronic configuration of iron is [Ar] 3d^6 4s^2. When it loses three electrons to form Fe3+, the electronic configuration becomes [Ar] 3d^5.\n\nIn the high spin state, the five d-electrons will occupy all five d-orbitals, with one electron in each orbital. This means that there are 5 unpaired electrons in the Fe3+ ion.\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic moment (μ) using the formula:\n\nμ = √(n(n+2)) μB\n\nwhere n is the number of unpaired electrons, and μB is the Bohr magneton (approximately 9.27 × 10^-24 J/T).\n\nμ = √(5(5+2)) μB\nμ = √(5(7)) μB\nμ = √(35) μB\n\nThe magnetic moment of FeCl3 in its high spin state is approximately √(35) μB, which is around 5.92 μB."
