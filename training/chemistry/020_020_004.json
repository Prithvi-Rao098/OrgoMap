    "message_2": "To find the change in the equilibrium constant (Kc) when the temperature is increased from 25°C to 50°C, we can use the Van't Hoff equation:\n\nln(K2/K1) = -ΔH°rxn/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere K1 is the equilibrium constant at T1 (25°C), K2 is the equilibrium constant at T2 (50°C), ΔH°rxn is the enthalpy change of the reaction, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), and T1 and T2 are the initial and final temperatures in Kelvin.\n\nFirst, convert the temperatures to Kelvin:\nT1 = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\nT2 = 50°C + 273.15 = 323.15 K\n\nNext, convert ΔH°rxn to J/mol:\nΔH°rxn = -133 kJ/mol * 1000 J/kJ = -133,000 J/mol\n\nNow, plug the values into the Van't Hoff equation:\n\nln(K2/K1) = -(-133,000 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K) * (1/323.15 K - 1/298.15 K)\n\nSolve for ln(K2/K1):\n\nln(K2/K1) = 6.073\n\nNow, solve for K2:\n\nK2 = K1 * e^(ln(K2/K1))\nK2 = (1.2 x 10^38) * e^(6.073)\nK2 ≈ 2.63 x 10^41\n\nThe change in the equilibrium constant is:\n\nΔKc = K2 - K1 = (2.63 x 10^41) - (1.2 x 10^38) ≈ 2.63 x 10^41\n\nSo, the change in the equilibrium constant when the temperature is increased from 25°C to 50°C is approximately 2.63 x 10^41."
