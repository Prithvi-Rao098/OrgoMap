    "message_2": "To determine the amount of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid that can be produced from 10 grams of benzoic acid, we need to use stoichiometry. First, let's find the molecular weights of benzoic acid and 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid.\n\nBenzoic acid (C7H6O2) has a molecular weight of:\n(7 * 12.01) + (6 * 1.01) + (2 * 16.00) = 84.07 + 6.06 + 32.00 = 122.13 g/mol\n\n2,4-Dinitrobenzoic acid (C7H4N2O6) has a molecular weight of:\n(7 * 12.01) + (4 * 1.01) + (2 * 14.01) + (6 * 16.00) = 84.07 + 4.04 + 28.02 + 96.00 = 212.13 g/mol\n\nNow, we can set up a stoichiometric ratio between benzoic acid and 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid:\n\n1 mol benzoic acid â†’ 1 mol 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid\n\nNext, convert the given mass of benzoic acid (10 grams) to moles:\n\n10 g benzoic acid * (1 mol benzoic acid / 122.13 g benzoic acid) = 0.0819 mol benzoic acid\n\nNow, use the stoichiometric ratio to find the moles of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid produced:\n\n0.0819 mol benzoic acid * (1 mol 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid / 1 mol benzoic acid) = 0.0819 mol 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid\n\nFinally, convert the moles of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid to grams:\n\n0.0819 mol 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid * (212.13 g 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid / 1 mol 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid) = 17.37 g 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid\n\nSo, 17.37 grams of 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid can be produced from 10 grams of benzoic acid and excess nitric acid during the synthesis process."
