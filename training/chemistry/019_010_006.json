    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise problem for a chemistry student to solve related to the subtopic of Calculation of standard enthalpy change for a combustion reaction:\n\nCalculate the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of methane gas (CH4) at standard conditions (298K, 1 atm). The balanced equation is:\n\nCH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(l)\n\nGiven enthalpies of formation at standard conditions: \n\nΔHfº(CO2) = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔHfº(H2O) = -285.8 kJ/mol\nΔHfº(CH4) = -74.8 kJ/mol\nΔHfº(O2) = 0 kJ/mol",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of methane gas (CH4), we can use the following equation:\n\nΔHº_combustion = Σ ΔHfº(products) - Σ ΔHfº(reactants)\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we have:\n\n1 mol of CO2 and 2 mol of H2O as products\n1 mol of CH4 and 2 mol of O2 as reactants\n\nNow, we can plug in the given enthalpies of formation:\n\nΔHº_combustion = [(1 × -393.5) + (2 × -285.8)] - [(1 × -74.8) + (2 × 0)]\n\nΔHº_combustion = (-393.5 - 571.6) - (-74.8)\n\nΔHº_combustion = -965.1 + 74.8\n\nΔHº_combustion = -890.3 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of methane gas (CH4) at standard conditions (298K, 1 atm) is -890.3 kJ/mol."
