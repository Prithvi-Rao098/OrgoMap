    "message_2": "The BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) theory of multilayer adsorption is used to determine the surface area of adsorbent materials. The BET equation is:\n\nn = (n_m * C * P) / [(1 - P) * (C - 1 + P)]\n\nwhere n is the adsorption capacity, n_m is the monolayer capacity, C is the BET constant, and P is the relative pressure (P/P0).\n\nIn this case, we are given the adsorption capacity (5.6 mmol/g) and the monolayer capacity (4.2 mmol/g). However, we do not have enough information to solve for the surface area directly, as we need the BET constant (C) and the relative pressure (P) to do so.\n\nIf you can provide the BET constant and the relative pressure, we can then calculate the surface area of the adsorbent material."
