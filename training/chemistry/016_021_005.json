    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change of the polymerization of styrene, we need to find the moles of styrene and the moles of CO2 produced. Then, we can use the heat of formation of CO2 to find the enthalpy change.\n\n1. Calculate the moles of styrene used:\nMolecular weight of styrene (C8H8) = (8 * 12.01) + (8 * 1.01) = 104.15 g/mol\nMoles of styrene = mass of styrene / molecular weight of styrene\nMoles of styrene = 50 g / 104.15 g/mol = 0.480 mol\n\n2. Calculate the moles of initiator used:\nMoles of initiator = Molarity * Volume\nMoles of initiator = 0.3 M * 0.025 L = 0.0075 mol\n\n3. Assume that the reaction goes to completion and all the styrene is converted to polystyrene and CO2. Since the initiator is used to start the reaction, it does not affect the stoichiometry of the reaction. Therefore, the moles of CO2 produced will be equal to the moles of styrene used.\n\nMoles of CO2 produced = 0.480 mol\n\n4. Calculate the enthalpy change using the heat of formation of CO2:\nEnthalpy change = moles of CO2 * heat of formation of CO2\nEnthalpy change = 0.480 mol * (-393.5 kJ/mol) = -188.88 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change of the polymerization of styrene is -188.88 kJ."
