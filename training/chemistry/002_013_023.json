    "message_2": "In the molecule XeF4, the central atom is Xenon (Xe). To determine the hybridization of the central atom, we need to consider the number of bonding pairs and lone pairs around the central atom.\n\nXenon has 8 valence electrons. In XeF4, there are 4 Fluorine (F) atoms bonded to the central Xenon atom, which accounts for 4 bonding pairs. Additionally, there are 2 lone pairs of electrons on the Xenon atom.\n\nThe total number of electron pairs around the central atom is 4 (bonding pairs) + 2 (lone pairs) = 6.\n\nTo accommodate 6 electron pairs, the hybridization of the central atom (Xe) in XeF4 is sp3d2."
