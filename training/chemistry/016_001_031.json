    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy of formation of hydrogen fluoride (HF), we need to manipulate the given reactions to obtain the target reaction: 1/2 H2(g) + 1/2 F2(g) → HF(g). \n\nFirst, let's divide the first reaction by 2 to get 1 mole of H2(g) on the reactant side:\n1/2 (2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(g)) \nH2(g) + 1/2 O2(g) → H2O(g) ΔH° = -242 kJ\n\nNow, let's divide the second reaction by 2 to get 1 mole of H2(g) on the reactant side:\n1/2 (H2(g) + Cl2(g) → 2HCl(g)) \nH2(g) + 1/2 Cl2(g) → HCl(g) ΔH° = -92 kJ\n\nWe can see that the third reaction is already in the desired form:\n1/2 F2(g) + H2(g) → HF(g) ΔH° = -273 kJ\n\nNow, we need to add the reactions in such a way that we obtain the target reaction. We can do this by adding the first and second reactions and then subtracting the third reaction:\n\n(H2(g) + 1/2 O2(g) → H2O(g)) + (H2(g) + 1/2 Cl2(g) → HCl(g)) - (1/2 F2(g) + H2(g) → HF(g))\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n1/2 H2(g) + 1/2 F2(g) → HF(g)\n\nNow, we need to add the enthalpy changes for these reactions:\n\nΔH° = (-242 kJ) + (-92 kJ) - (-273 kJ) = -334 kJ\n\nSo, the standard enthalpy of formation of hydrogen fluoride (HF) is -334 kJ/mol."
