    "message_2": "To calculate the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the given reaction, we can use the expression:\n\nKc = [SO3]^2 / ([SO2]^2 * [O2])\n\nGiven the concentrations at equilibrium:\n\n[SO2] = 0.20 M\n[O2] = 0.30 M\n[SO3] = 0.50 M\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Kc expression:\n\nKc = (0.50)^2 / ((0.20)^2 * (0.30))\n\nKc = 0.25 / (0.04 * 0.30)\n\nKc = 0.25 / 0.012\n\nKc ≈ 20.83\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium constant for the reaction is approximately 20.83."
