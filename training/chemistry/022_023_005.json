    "message_2": "To find the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid (CH3COOH) with a Ka of 1.8 x 10^-5, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Write the dissociation equation for acetic acid:\n   CH3COOH ⇌ CH3COO- + H+\n\n2. Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations of each species:\n\n   CH3COOH  | CH3COO- | H+\n   Initial  | 0.1 M   | 0 M    | 0 M\n   Change   | -x      | +x     | +x\n   Equilibrium | 0.1-x | x      | x\n\n3. Write the expression for the Ka of acetic acid:\n   Ka = [CH3COO-][H+]/[CH3COOH]\n\n4. Substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table into the Ka expression:\n   1.8 x 10^-5 = (x)(x)/(0.1-x)\n\n5. Since Ka is very small, we can assume that x is much smaller than 0.1, so we can simplify the equation to:\n   1.8 x 10^-5 ≈ (x)(x)/0.1\n\n6. Solve for x:\n   x^2 = 1.8 x 10^-5 * 0.1\n   x^2 = 1.8 x 10^-6\n   x = √(1.8 x 10^-6)\n   x ≈ 1.34 x 10^-3\n\n7. Since x represents the concentration of H+ ions, we can now find the pH using the pH formula:\n   pH = -log[H+]\n   pH = -log(1.34 x 10^-3)\n   pH ≈ 2.87\n\nSo, the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid (CH3COOH) with a Ka of 1.8 x 10^-5 is approximately 2.87."
