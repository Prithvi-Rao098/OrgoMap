    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of stoichiometry and the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The balanced equation is:\n\nH₂SO₄ + 2NaOH → Na₂SO₄ + 2H₂O\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of H₂SO₄ reacts with 2 moles of NaOH. Now, we can use the given information to find the amount of sulfuric acid required to neutralize the sodium hydroxide solution.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of moles of NaOH in the 25 mL of 0.1 M solution:\n\nmoles of NaOH = Molarity × Volume (in liters)\nmoles of NaOH = 0.1 mol/L × 0.025 L\nmoles of NaOH = 0.0025 mol\n\nNow, using the stoichiometry from the balanced equation, we can find the moles of H₂SO₄ required:\n\nmoles of H₂SO₄ = (moles of NaOH × 1) / 2\nmoles of H₂SO₄ = (0.0025 mol × 1) / 2\nmoles of H₂SO₄ = 0.00125 mol\n\nNow, let's assume we have a 1 M solution of H₂SO₄. We can find the volume of this solution required to provide the necessary moles of H₂SO₄:\n\nVolume of H₂SO₄ = moles of H₂SO₄ / Molarity\nVolume of H₂SO₄ = 0.00125 mol / 1 mol/L\nVolume of H₂SO₄ = 0.00125 L\n\nTo convert this volume to milliliters, we multiply by 1000:\n\nVolume of H₂SO₄ = 0.00125 L × 1000 mL/L\nVolume of H₂SO₄ = 1.25 mL\n\nSo, 1.25 mL of a 1 M solution of sulfuric acid is required to completely neutralize 25 mL of a 0.1 M solution of sodium hydroxide."
