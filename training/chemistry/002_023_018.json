    "message_2": "The effect of different concentrations of inorganic salts on the electric conductivity of their solutions can be explained by understanding the relationship between concentration and conductivity.\n\nIn general, the electric conductivity of a solution depends on the number of ions present in the solution, their mobility, and their charge. Inorganic salts, when dissolved in water, dissociate into their respective ions. These ions are responsible for carrying the electric current through the solution.\n\nAs the concentration of an inorganic salt in a solution increases, the number of ions in the solution also increases. This leads to an increase in the electric conductivity of the solution. However, this relationship is not always linear, as the increase in concentration can also lead to a decrease in the mobility of the ions due to increased interactions between them.\n\nIn dilute solutions, the conductivity increases almost linearly with the increase in concentration. This is because the ions are far apart from each other, and their mobility is not significantly affected by the increase in concentration.\n\nIn concentrated solutions, the conductivity still increases with the increase in concentration, but at a slower rate. This is because the ions are closer together, and their mobility is reduced due to increased interactions between them. Additionally, the higher concentration of ions can lead to the formation of ion pairs or complexes, which can further reduce the conductivity of the solution.\n\nThe effect of different concentrations of inorganic salts on the electric conductivity of their solutions can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. In dilute solutions, the conductivity increases almost linearly with the increase in concentration.\n2. In concentrated solutions, the conductivity still increases with the increase in concentration, but at a slower rate due to reduced ion mobility and the formation of ion pairs or complexes.\n\nIt is also important to note that the specific conductivity of a solution depends on the type of inorganic salt used, as different salts have different dissociation properties and ion mobilities. For example, salts with higher charges on their ions (e.g., MgSO4) will generally have higher conductivities than salts with lower charges (e.g., NaCl) at the same concentration."
