    "message_2": "There are five common types of chemical reactions:\n\n1. Synthesis (combination) reactions: Two or more substances combine to form a single product. The general form is A + B → AB.\n\n2. Decomposition reactions: A single compound breaks down into two or more simpler substances. The general form is AB → A + B.\n\n3. Single displacement (replacement) reactions: One element in a compound is replaced by another element. The general form is A + BC → AC + B.\n\n4. Double displacement (metathesis) reactions: Two compounds exchange ions or elements to form new compounds. The general form is AB + CD → AD + CB.\n\n5. Redox (oxidation-reduction) reactions: These reactions involve a transfer of electrons between species, leading to changes in oxidation states. They can be a combination of synthesis, decomposition, or displacement reactions.\n\nTo balance chemical equations accurately, follow these steps:\n\n1. Write the unbalanced equation using correct chemical formulas for all reactants and products.\n\n2. Count the number of atoms of each element on both sides of the equation.\n\n3. Balance the equation by adjusting the coefficients (the numbers in front of the chemical formulas) so that the number of atoms for each element is the same on both sides of the equation. Start with the most complex substance or the element that appears in the greatest number of compounds.\n\n4. Make sure the coefficients are in the lowest whole number ratio. If necessary, multiply all coefficients by a common factor to achieve this.\n\n5. Check your work by counting the atoms of each element again to ensure they are equal on both sides of the equation.\n\nRemember that you can only change the coefficients, not the subscripts within the chemical formulas, as changing subscripts would alter the identity of the compounds involved."
