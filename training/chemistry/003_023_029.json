    "message_2": "To calculate the change in enthalpy (ΔH) for the reaction, we can use the formula:\n\nΔH = Σ ΔH(products) - Σ ΔH(reactants)\n\nFirst, we need to balance the chemical equation for the combustion of methane:\n\nCH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O\n\nNow, we can calculate the moles of methane:\n\nMoles of CH4 = mass / molar mass = 4.5 g / (12.01 g/mol (C) + 4 * 1.01 g/mol (H)) = 4.5 g / 16.05 g/mol ≈ 0.2804 mol\n\nSince the balanced equation shows that 1 mole of CH4 produces 1 mole of CO2 and 2 moles of H2O, we can calculate the moles of CO2 and H2O produced:\n\nMoles of CO2 = 0.2804 mol\nMoles of H2O = 2 * 0.2804 mol = 0.5608 mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nΔH = [ΔH(CO2) * moles of CO2 + ΔH(H2O) * moles of H2O] - [ΔH(CH4) * moles of CH4]\nΔH = [(-393.5 kJ/mol * 0.2804 mol) + (-285.8 kJ/mol * 0.5608 mol)] - [-74.8 kJ/mol * 0.2804 mol]\n\nΔH = [-110.3 kJ + (-160.3 kJ)] - [20.98 kJ]\nΔH = -270.6 kJ + 20.98 kJ\nΔH ≈ -249.62 kJ\n\nThe change in enthalpy for the complete combustion of 4.5 grams of methane is approximately -249.62 kJ."
