The reaction takes place at 25°C and 1 atm pressure. The following reaction is involved: \n\nC12H22O11(s) + H2O(l) → 12C(s) + 11H2O(l) \n\nThe enthalpy of formation of C12H22O11(s) is -2226.8 kJ/mol and the enthalpy of formation of H2O(l) is -285.8 kJ/mol.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of sucrose, we will use the following equation:\n\nΔH = Σ ΔHf(products) - Σ ΔHf(reactants)\n\nFirst, we need to determine the number of moles of sucrose in 10.0 g. The molar mass of sucrose (C12H22O11) is:\n\n(12 x 12.01) + (22 x 1.01) + (11 x 16.00) = 144.12 + 22.22 + 176.00 = 342.34 g/mol\n\nNumber of moles of sucrose = mass / molar mass = 10.0 g / 342.34 g/mol = 0.0292 mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nΔH = [12ΔHf(C) + 11ΔHf(H2O)] - [ΔHf(sucrose) + ΔHf(H2O)]\n\nSince the enthalpy of formation of carbon (C) in its standard state is 0 kJ/mol, the equation becomes:\n\nΔH = [11ΔHf(H2O)] - [ΔHf(sucrose) + ΔHf(H2O)]\n\nΔH = [11(-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [(-2226.8 kJ/mol) + (-285.8 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH = [-3143.8 kJ/mol] - [-2512.6 kJ/mol]\n\nΔH = -631.2 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we need to find the enthalpy change for 0.0292 mol of sucrose:\n\nΔH = -631.2 kJ/mol x 0.0292 mol = -18.42 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 10.0 g of sucrose is -18.42 kJ."
