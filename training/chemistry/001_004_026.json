    "message_2": "The nucleophilic substitution reaction of 2-bromopentane with sodium methoxide follows an SN2 (substitution nucleophilic bimolecular) mechanism. Here's the complete reaction pathway:\n\n1. Sodium methoxide (NaOCH3) dissociates into sodium (Na+) and methoxide (CH3O-) ions. Methoxide is a strong nucleophile.\n\n2. The methoxide ion (CH3O-) attacks the electrophilic carbon atom (C2) of 2-bromopentane from the backside, opposite to the bromine atom. This backside attack leads to the inversion of configuration at the carbon center.\n\n3. As the methoxide ion forms a bond with the electrophilic carbon, the carbon-bromine bond starts to break, and the bromine atom leaves as a bromide ion (Br-).\n\n4. The product is 2-methoxypentane, and the leaving group is the bromide ion (Br-). The sodium ion (Na+) associates with the bromide ion to form sodium bromide (NaBr).\n\nOverall reaction: 2-bromopentane + sodium methoxide -> 2-methoxypentane + sodium bromide\n\nThere are no intermediates in this reaction, as the SN2 mechanism involves a single concerted step. The products are 2-methoxypentane and sodium bromide."
