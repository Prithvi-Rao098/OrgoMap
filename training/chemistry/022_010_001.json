    "message_2": "The balanced chemical equation for the precipitation reaction between silver nitrate (AgNO3) and sodium chloride (NaCl) is:\n\nAgNO3(aq) + NaCl(aq) → AgCl(s) + NaNO3(aq)\n\nTo determine the amount of silver chloride (AgCl) produced, we need to find the limiting reactant. First, we'll calculate the moles of each reactant:\n\nMoles of AgNO3 = (volume in L) × (molarity)\nMoles of AgNO3 = (25.0 mL × 0.001 L/mL) × 0.200 M = 0.00500 moles\n\nMoles of NaCl = (volume in L) × (molarity)\nMoles of NaCl = (50.0 mL × 0.001 L/mL) × 0.100 M = 0.00500 moles\n\nThe stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, so we can see that both reactants have the same amount of moles, and neither is in excess. Therefore, the limiting reactant is either AgNO3 or NaCl, and the reaction will produce 0.00500 moles of AgCl.\n\nNow, we'll convert moles of AgCl to grams using the molar mass of AgCl (143.32 g/mol):\n\nMass of AgCl = (moles of AgCl) × (molar mass of AgCl)\nMass of AgCl = 0.00500 moles × 143.32 g/mol = 0.716 g\n\nSo, 0.716 grams of silver chloride (AgCl) will be produced."
