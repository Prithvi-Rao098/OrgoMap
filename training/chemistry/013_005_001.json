The sample weighs 0.5 g and has a bulk density of 0.4 g/cm3. Assume that the only gas adsorbed by the sample is nitrogen at this temperature and pressure.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the specific surface area of the activated carbon sample, we can use the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. The BET method is based on the adsorption of a monolayer of gas molecules (in this case, nitrogen) onto the surface of the solid (activated carbon). The specific surface area can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nSpecific surface area (SSA) = (V_ads * N_A * M_mol * A_cross) / (m_sample * P)\n\nwhere:\n- V_ads is the volume of nitrogen adsorbed (0.1 cm³)\n- N_A is Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10²³ molecules/mol)\n- M_mol is the molar mass of nitrogen (28.02 g/mol)\n- A_cross is the cross-sectional area of a nitrogen molecule (0.162 nm²)\n- m_sample is the mass of the activated carbon sample (0.5 g)\n- P is the adsorption pressure (1 atm)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the volume of nitrogen adsorbed (V_ads) from cm³ to mol using the ideal gas law:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nwhere:\n- P is the pressure (1 atm)\n- V is the volume (0.1 cm³, which is equal to 0.1/1000 = 0.0001 L)\n- n is the number of moles\n- R is the gas constant (0.0821 L atm / K mol)\n- T is the temperature (77 K)\n\nSolving for n:\n\nn = PV / RT = (1 atm * 0.0001 L) / (0.0821 L atm / K mol * 77 K) = 1.585 x 10⁻⁵ mol\n\nNow we can calculate the specific surface area (SSA):\n\nSSA = (1.585 x 10⁻⁵ mol * 6.022 x 10²³ molecules/mol * 28.02 g/mol * 0.162 nm²) / (0.5 g * 1 atm) = 878.6 m²/g\n\nThe specific surface area of the activated carbon sample is approximately 878.6 m²/g."
