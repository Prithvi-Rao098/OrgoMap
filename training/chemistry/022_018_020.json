    "message_2": "First, let's calculate the energy required to break all the bonds in 1 mole of methane gas (CH4). Methane has 4 C-H bonds, and the bond energy of a C-H bond is 413 kJ/mol.\n\nEnergy required to break 1 mole of C-H bonds in CH4 = 4 (C-H bonds) × 413 kJ/mol (C-H bond energy) = 1652 kJ/mol\n\nNow, let's calculate the energy released or absorbed during the combustion of 1 mole of methane gas with oxygen gas to form carbon dioxide gas and water vapor. The balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane is:\n\nCH4 + 2 O2 → CO2 + 2 H2O\n\nThe bond energies for the relevant bonds are as follows:\nC-H bond energy: 413 kJ/mol\nO=O (double bond) bond energy: 498 kJ/mol\nC=O (double bond) bond energy: 799 kJ/mol\nO-H bond energy: 467 kJ/mol\n\nEnergy required to break bonds in reactants:\n1 mole CH4: 4 C-H bonds × 413 kJ/mol = 1652 kJ/mol\n2 moles O2: 2 O=O bonds × 498 kJ/mol = 996 kJ/mol\nTotal energy required to break bonds in reactants = 1652 kJ/mol + 996 kJ/mol = 2648 kJ/mol\n\nEnergy released when bonds are formed in products:\n1 mole CO2: 2 C=O bonds × 799 kJ/mol = 1598 kJ/mol\n2 moles H2O: 4 O-H bonds × 467 kJ/mol = 1868 kJ/mol\nTotal energy released when bonds are formed in products = 1598 kJ/mol + 1868 kJ/mol = 3466 kJ/mol\n\nTotal energy released or absorbed during the combustion of 1 mole of methane gas = Energy released when bonds are formed in products - Energy required to break bonds in reactants = 3466 kJ/mol - 2648 kJ/mol = 818 kJ/mol (released)\n\nSo, the total energy released during the combustion of 1 mole of methane gas with oxygen gas to form carbon dioxide gas and water vapor is 818 kJ/mol."
