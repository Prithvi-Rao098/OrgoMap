    "message_2": "To determine the empirical formula of the compound, we need to find the moles of carbon and hydrogen in the sample. We can do this by using the masses of carbon dioxide and water produced upon combustion.\n\n1. Calculate the moles of carbon from the mass of carbon dioxide produced:\nMass of CO₂ = 1.442 g\nMolar mass of CO₂ = 12.01 g/mol (C) + 2 * 16.00 g/mol (O) = 44.01 g/mol\nMoles of C = (mass of CO₂) / (molar mass of CO₂) = 1.442 g / 44.01 g/mol = 0.03276 mol\n\n2. Calculate the moles of hydrogen from the mass of water produced:\nMass of H₂O = 0.589 g\nMolar mass of H₂O = 2 * 1.01 g/mol (H) + 16.00 g/mol (O) = 18.02 g/mol\nMoles of H = (mass of H₂O) / (molar mass of H₂O) = 0.589 g / 18.02 g/mol = 0.03271 mol\n\n3. Determine the mole ratio of carbon to hydrogen:\nDivide the moles of each element by the smallest number of moles to get the mole ratio:\nMole ratio of C:H = 0.03276 mol / 0.03271 mol : 0.03271 mol / 0.03271 mol = 1 : 1\n\n4. Write the empirical formula:\nThe empirical formula of the compound is CH, which indicates that there is one carbon atom and one hydrogen atom in the simplest ratio."
