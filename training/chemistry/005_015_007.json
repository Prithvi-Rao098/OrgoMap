    "message_2": "The complete oxidation of one glucose molecule through glycolysis, the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle), and oxidative phosphorylation yields a net production of ATP molecules. Here's the breakdown of ATP production in each stage:\n\n1. Glycolysis: \n- Net production of 2 ATP molecules (substrate-level phosphorylation)\n- 2 NADH molecules are produced, which can generate 3 ATP molecules each through oxidative phosphorylation (total of 6 ATP)\n\n2. Pyruvate Decarboxylation (Transition step):\n- 2 NADH molecules are produced (one per pyruvate), which can generate 3 ATP molecules each through oxidative phosphorylation (total of 6 ATP)\n\n3. Citric Acid Cycle:\n- 2 ATP molecules are produced through substrate-level phosphorylation (one per cycle)\n- 6 NADH molecules are produced (3 per cycle), which can generate 3 ATP molecules each through oxidative phosphorylation (total of 18 ATP)\n- 2 FADH2 molecules are produced (one per cycle), which can generate 2 ATP molecules each through oxidative phosphorylation (total of 4 ATP)\n\nAdding up the ATP production from each stage:\n2 (Glycolysis) + 6 (NADH from Glycolysis) + 6 (NADH from Pyruvate Decarboxylation) + 2 (Citric Acid Cycle) + 18 (NADH from Citric Acid Cycle) + 4 (FADH2 from Citric Acid Cycle) = 38 ATP molecules\n\nHowever, it is important to note that in eukaryotic cells, the transport of NADH produced in glycolysis into the mitochondria for oxidative phosphorylation consumes 2 ATP molecules. Therefore, the net ATP yield per glucose molecule in eukaryotic cells is 36 ATP molecules. In prokaryotic cells, where there is no need for NADH transport, the net ATP yield remains 38 ATP molecules."
