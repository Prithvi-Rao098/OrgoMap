    "message_2": "To determine the yield of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, we first need to know the balanced chemical equation for the reaction and the molecular weights of the reactants and product.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nC₆H₃ClN₂O₄ + N₂H₄ → C₆H₃N₄O₄ + HCl\n\nMolecular weights:\nHydrazine (N₂H₄) = (2 x 14.01) + (4 x 1.01) = 32.05 g/mol\n2,4-Dinitrochlorobenzene (C₆H₃ClN₂O₄) = (6 x 12.01) + (3 x 1.01) + (1 x 35.45) + (2 x 14.01) + (4 x 16.00) = 202.56 g/mol\n2,4-Dinitrophenylhydrazine (C₆H₃N₄O₄) = (6 x 12.01) + (3 x 1.01) + (4 x 14.01) + (4 x 16.00) = 198.14 g/mol\n\nNow, we need to determine the moles of hydrazine used in the reaction:\n\nmoles of hydrazine = mass of hydrazine / molecular weight of hydrazine\nmoles of hydrazine = 10 g / 32.05 g/mol = 0.312 moles\n\nSince the reaction has a 1:1 stoichiometry between hydrazine and 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, the moles of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine produced will be equal to the moles of hydrazine used.\n\nmoles of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine = 0.312 moles\n\nNow, we can calculate the mass of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine produced:\n\nmass of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine = moles of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine x molecular weight of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine\nmass of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine = 0.312 moles x 198.14 g/mol = 61.80 g\n\nTherefore, the yield of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine that can be obtained by reacting 10 g of hydrazine with excess 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene in the presence of a catalyst is 61.80 g."
