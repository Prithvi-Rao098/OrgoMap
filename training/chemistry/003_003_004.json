    "message_2": "To determine the rate law, we need to find the order of the reaction with respect to each reactant. We can do this by comparing the rates of different experiments.\n\nLet's compare experiments 1 and 2. The concentration of NO is the same in both experiments, but the concentration of O2 doubles from experiment 1 to experiment 2. The rate increases by a factor of (2.24 x 10^-2) / (5.6 x 10^-3) = 4. Since the rate quadrupled when the concentration of O2 doubled, the reaction is second-order with respect to O2.\n\nNow let's compare experiments 2 and 3. The concentration of O2 is the same in both experiments, but the concentration of NO doubles from experiment 2 to experiment 3. The rate doubles from 2.24 x 10^-2 to 4.48 x 10^-2. Since the rate doubled when the concentration of NO doubled, the reaction is first-order with respect to NO.\n\nThe overall order of the reaction is the sum of the orders with respect to each reactant, which is 1 (for NO) + 2 (for O2) = 3.\n\nThe rate law is given by: rate = k[NO]^1[O2]^2\n\nNow we can find the rate constant (k) using the data from any of the experiments. Let's use experiment 1:\n\n5.6 x 10^-3 = k(0.010)^1(0.005)^2\n\nSolving for k:\n\nk = (5.6 x 10^-3) / (0.010 * 0.000025) = 224\n\nSo the rate constant (k) is 224 L²/mol²·s.\n\nIn summary, the reaction is first-order with respect to NO, second-order with respect to O2, and the overall order is 3. The rate law is rate = 224[NO][O2]^2, and the rate constant (k) is 224 L²/mol²·s."
