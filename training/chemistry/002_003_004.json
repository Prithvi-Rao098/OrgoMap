    "message_2": "To determine the solubility product constant (Ksp) for lead (II) chloride (PbCl2) at 25 °C, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the dissolution of PbCl2 in water:\n\nPbCl2 (s) ⇌ Pb²⁺ (aq) + 2Cl⁻ (aq)\n\nThe solubility of PbCl2 in water is given as 1.6 x 10^-4 mol/L. This means that for every mole of PbCl2 that dissolves, one mole of Pb²⁺ ions and two moles of Cl⁻ ions are produced. Therefore, the concentrations of Pb²⁺ and Cl⁻ ions at equilibrium are:\n\n[Pb²⁺] = 1.6 x 10^-4 mol/L\n[Cl⁻] = 2 x (1.6 x 10^-4) mol/L = 3.2 x 10^-4 mol/L\n\nNow, we can calculate the solubility product constant (Ksp) using the equilibrium concentrations of the ions:\n\nKsp = [Pb²⁺] * [Cl⁻]^2\nKsp = (1.6 x 10^-4) * (3.2 x 10^-4)^2\nKsp = (1.6 x 10^-4) * (1.024 x 10^-7)\nKsp = 1.6384 x 10^-11\n\nSo, the solubility product constant (Ksp) for lead (II) chloride (PbCl2) at 25 °C is 1.6384 x 10^-11.\n\nNow, let's discuss how the solubility of PbCl2 changes in the presence of a common ion. The common ion effect states that the solubility of a sparingly soluble salt decreases in the presence of a common ion. In the case of PbCl2, the common ion would be Cl⁻.\n\nIf we add a soluble salt containing Cl⁻ ions, such as NaCl, to the solution, the concentration of Cl⁻ ions will increase. According to Le Chatelier's principle, the equilibrium will shift to counteract this change, which in this case means shifting to the left (towards the formation of solid PbCl2). As a result, the solubility of PbCl2 will decrease in the presence of a common ion like Cl⁻.\n\nIn summary, the solubility product constant (Ksp) for lead (II) chloride (PbCl2) at 25 °C is 1.6384 x 10^-11, and its solubility decreases in the presence of a common ion due to the common ion effect and Le Chatelier's principle."
