    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction, we need to find the difference between the bond enthalpies of the reactants and products.\n\nReactants: 2H2O(l)\nThere are 2 H-O bonds in each H2O molecule, so there are a total of 4 H-O bonds in 2H2O.\nTotal bond enthalpy of reactants = 4 * H-O bond enthalpy = 4 * 463 kJ/mol = 1852 kJ/mol\n\nProducts: 2H2(g) + O2(g)\nThere are 1 H-H bond in each H2 molecule, so there are a total of 2 H-H bonds in 2H2.\nThere is 1 O=O bond in O2 molecule.\nTotal bond enthalpy of products = (2 * H-H bond enthalpy) + O=O bond enthalpy = (2 * 436 kJ/mol) + 498 kJ/mol = 872 kJ/mol + 498 kJ/mol = 1370 kJ/mol\n\nEnthalpy change (ΔH) = Total bond enthalpy of products - Total bond enthalpy of reactants = 1370 kJ/mol - 1852 kJ/mol = -482 kJ/mol\n\nSince the enthalpy change is negative, the reaction is exothermic."
