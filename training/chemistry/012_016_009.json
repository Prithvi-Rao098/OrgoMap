    "message_2": "The optimal composition of a metal alloy for use in manufacturing aircraft engines that can withstand high temperatures and pressures during flight would be a nickel-based superalloy. Nickel-based superalloys are known for their excellent mechanical strength, resistance to thermal creep deformation, good surface stability, and resistance to corrosion and oxidation at high temperatures.\n\nA common nickel-based superalloy used in aircraft engines is Inconel 718, which has the following composition:\n\n- Nickel (Ni): 50-55%\n- Chromium (Cr): 17-21%\n- Iron (Fe): balance (typically around 18%)\n- Niobium (Nb): 4.75-5.5%\n- Molybdenum (Mo): 2.8-3.3%\n- Titanium (Ti): 0.65-1.15%\n- Aluminum (Al): 0.2-0.8%\n- Cobalt (Co): 1% max\n- Copper (Cu): 0.3% max\n- Manganese (Mn): 0.35% max\n- Silicon (Si): 0.35% max\n- Carbon (C): 0.08% max\n- Phosphorus (P): 0.015% max\n- Sulfur (S): 0.015% max\n- Boron (B): 0.006% max\n\nThis composition provides a balance of properties that make it suitable for use in aircraft engines, including high-temperature strength, resistance to creep, and good corrosion resistance. However, it is important to note that the specific requirements of an aircraft engine may vary, and other nickel-based superalloys or even different types of alloys may be more appropriate for specific applications."
