Given that the heat capacity of solid carbon dioxide is 38 J/mol/K, the heat capacity of gaseous carbon dioxide is 28.5 J/mol/K, and the melting point of carbon dioxide is -78.5°C.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the phase transition of solid carbon dioxide (CO2) to gaseous CO2, we need to consider the sublimation process since CO2 undergoes sublimation (direct transition from solid to gas) rather than melting.\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the sublimation of CO2 can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nΔH_sub = ΔH_fusion + ΔH_vaporization\n\nHowever, we are not given the values for ΔH_fusion and ΔH_vaporization. Instead, we are given the heat capacities of solid and gaseous CO2 and the melting point of CO2. We can use these values to estimate the enthalpy change for the sublimation process.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the heat required to raise the temperature of solid CO2 from -78.5°C to 0°C:\n\nq1 = (heat capacity of solid CO2) × (change in temperature)\nq1 = (38 J/mol/K) × (78.5 K) = 2983 J/mol\n\nNext, we need to calculate the heat required to raise the temperature of gaseous CO2 from 0°C to -78.5°C:\n\nq2 = (heat capacity of gaseous CO2) × (change in temperature)\nq2 = (28.5 J/mol/K) × (78.5 K) = 2236.25 J/mol\n\nNow, we can estimate the enthalpy change for the sublimation process by adding the heat required for both processes:\n\nΔH_sub ≈ q1 + q2 = 2983 J/mol + 2236.25 J/mol = 5219.25 J/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the phase transition of solid carbon dioxide to gaseous carbon dioxide is approximately 5219.25 J/mol. Keep in mind that this is an estimation based on the given heat capacities and melting point, and the actual value may be slightly different."
