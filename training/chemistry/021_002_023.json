    "message_2": "To calculate the bond length between two carbon atoms in a molecule of ethane, we can use the formula for the potential energy of a diatomic molecule:\n\nV(r) = (1/2) * k * (r - r0)^2\n\nwhere V(r) is the potential energy, k is the force constant, r is the bond length, and r0 is the equilibrium bond length.\n\nWe can also relate the bond energy to the potential energy:\n\nBond energy = V(r0)\n\nGiven the bond energy (347 kJ/mol) and the force constant (667 N/m), we can solve for the equilibrium bond length (r0).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the bond energy from kJ/mol to J/mol:\n\n347 kJ/mol * (1000 J/1 kJ) = 347000 J/mol\n\nNow, we can set the bond energy equal to the potential energy:\n\n347000 J/mol = (1/2) * 667 N/m * (r0)^2\n\nNext, we can solve for r0:\n\nr0^2 = (347000 J/mol) / (1/2 * 667 N/m)\nr0^2 = (347000 J/mol) / (333.5 N/m)\nr0^2 = 1040.48 m^2/mol\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find r0:\n\nr0 = √1040.48 m^2/mol\nr0 ≈ 32.26 m/mol\n\nSince the bond length is usually expressed in Ångströms (Å), we can convert the bond length from meters to Ångströms:\n\nr0 ≈ 32.26 m/mol * (1 Å/0.1 nm) * (1 nm/1e-9 m)\nr0 ≈ 322.6 Å/mol\n\nThus, the bond length between two carbon atoms in a molecule of ethane is approximately 322.6 Å/mol."
