    "message_2": "Uranium-235 is represented by the isotope notation ²³⁵U. The atomic number of uranium (U) is 92, which means it has 92 protons. The number of electrons in a neutral atom is equal to the number of protons, so there are also 92 electrons.\n\nTo determine the number of neutrons, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of neutrons = Mass number (A) - Atomic number (Z)\n\nIn this case, the mass number (A) is 235, and the atomic number (Z) is 92:\n\nNumber of neutrons = 235 - 92 = 143\n\nSo, Uranium-235 has 92 protons, 143 neutrons, and 92 electrons. Note that the electrons are not in the nucleus, but rather orbiting around it."
