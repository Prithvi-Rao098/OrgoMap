    "message_2": "To determine the standard enthalpy change for the vaporization of 50g of ethyl alcohol, we first need to calculate the number of moles of ethyl alcohol in 50g.\n\nNumber of moles = mass / molar mass\nNumber of moles = 50g / 46.07 g/mol = 1.085 moles\n\nNow, we can use the molar heat of vaporization to calculate the enthalpy change.\n\nEnthalpy change = number of moles × molar heat of vaporization\nEnthalpy change = 1.085 moles × 38.56 kJ/mol = 41.83 kJ\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change for the vaporization of 50g of ethyl alcohol at its normal boiling point of 78.4°C is 41.83 kJ."
