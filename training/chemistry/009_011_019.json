    "message_2": "To find the age of the fossil, we can use the half-life formula:\n\nN = N0 * (1/2)^(t/T)\n\nWhere:\nN = the final amount of carbon-14 (8 grams)\nN0 = the initial amount of carbon-14 (32 grams)\nt = the age of the fossil (which we want to find)\nT = the half-life of carbon-14 (5730 years)\n\nWe can rearrange the formula to solve for t:\n\nt = T * (log(N/N0) / log(1/2))\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nt = 5730 * (log(8/32) / log(1/2))\n\nt = 5730 * (log(0.25) / log(0.5))\n\nt = 5730 * (-2)\n\nt = -11460\n\nSince the age cannot be negative, we made an error in our calculation. The correct formula to use is:\n\nt = T * (log(N0/N) / log(2))\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nt = 5730 * (log(32/8) / log(2))\n\nt = 5730 * (log(4) / log(2))\n\nt = 5730 * 2\n\nt = 11460\n\nThe age of the fossil is 11,460 years."
