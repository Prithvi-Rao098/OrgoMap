    "message_2": "The standard enthalpy change of formation (ΔHf°) for a compound is the change in enthalpy when one mole of the compound is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states. In this case, we are given the enthalpies of formation for carbon (C), oxygen (O2), and carbon dioxide (CO2).\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the formation of CO2 is:\n\nC (s) + O2 (g) → CO2 (g)\n\nThe enthalpies of formation for the reactants are:\n\nΔHf° [C (s)] = 0 kJ/mol\nΔHf° [O2 (g)] = 0 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy of formation for the product is:\n\nΔHf° [CO2 (g)] = -393.5 kJ/mol\n\nTo calculate the standard enthalpy change of formation for CO2, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔHf° (reaction) = Σ ΔHf° (products) - Σ ΔHf° (reactants)\n\nIn this case, the equation becomes:\n\nΔHf° (reaction) = ΔHf° [CO2 (g)] - (ΔHf° [C (s)] + ΔHf° [O2 (g)])\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nΔHf° (reaction) = -393.5 kJ/mol - (0 kJ/mol + 0 kJ/mol)\n\nΔHf° (reaction) = -393.5 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change of formation for carbon dioxide (CO2) is -393.5 kJ/mol."
