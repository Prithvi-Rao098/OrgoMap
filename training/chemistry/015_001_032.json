    "message_2": "Ethene (C2H4) is an organic compound consisting of two carbon atoms double-bonded to each other, with each carbon atom also bonded to two hydrogen atoms. To understand the molecular orbital diagram and bonding in ethene, we need to consider the atomic orbitals of carbon and hydrogen.\n\nCarbon has the electron configuration 1s² 2s² 2p². In ethene, carbon undergoes sp² hybridization, where one 2s orbital and two 2p orbitals combine to form three sp² hybrid orbitals. These sp² orbitals are used to form sigma (σ) bonds with the hydrogen atoms and the other carbon atom. The remaining 2p orbital on each carbon atom is unhybridized and forms a pi (π) bond between the two carbon atoms.\n\nHydrogen has the electron configuration 1s¹. Each hydrogen atom contributes one 1s orbital to form a sigma bond with the carbon atom.\n\nThe molecular orbital diagram of ethene can be described as follows:\n\n1. Sigma (σ) bonds:\n   a. Each carbon atom forms three sigma bonds: one with the other carbon atom and two with the hydrogen atoms. These sigma bonds are formed by the overlap of sp² orbitals from carbon with the 1s orbitals of hydrogen and the sp² orbital of the other carbon.\n   \n2. Pi (π) bond:\n   a. The remaining unhybridized 2p orbitals on each carbon atom overlap side-by-side to form a pi bond. This bond is responsible for the double bond character in ethene.\n\nThe electronic structure of ethene explains the bonding in the molecule as follows:\n\n1. The three sp² hybrid orbitals on each carbon atom allow for the formation of strong sigma bonds with the hydrogen atoms and the other carbon atom, creating a planar structure.\n2. The pi bond formed by the overlap of the unhybridized 2p orbitals on each carbon atom results in a double bond between the two carbon atoms, which contributes to the overall stability and rigidity of the ethene molecule.\n\nIn summary, the molecular orbital diagram of ethene consists of sigma bonds formed by the overlap of sp² hybrid orbitals and a pi bond formed by the overlap of unhybridized 2p orbitals. This electronic structure explains the bonding in the molecule, including the planar geometry and the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond."
