    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to know the half-life of the radioactive isotope and the percentage of the original amount we want to calculate the time for.\n\nThe formula to calculate the time it takes for a radioactive isotope to decay to a certain percentage of its original amount is:\n\ntime = (half-life * log(percentage remaining)) / log(0.5)\n\nwhere:\n- time is the time it takes for the isotope to decay to the desired percentage\n- half-life is the half-life of the radioactive isotope\n- percentage remaining is the desired percentage of the original amount (in decimal form, e.g., 50% = 0.5)\n\nPlease provide the half-life of the radioactive isotope and the desired percentage of the original amount, and I will calculate the time it takes for the isotope to decay to that percentage."
