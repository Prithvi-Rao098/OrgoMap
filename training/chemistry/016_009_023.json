    "message_1": "Calculate the enthalpy of vaporization of water given that it has a vapor pressure of 1.00 atm at 100°C and its molar enthalpy of vaporization at 373 K is 40.7 kJ/mol.",
    "message_2": "The problem statement already provides the molar enthalpy of vaporization of water at 373 K (100°C), which is 40.7 kJ/mol. Therefore, the enthalpy of vaporization of water is 40.7 kJ/mol."
