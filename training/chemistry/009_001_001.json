    "message_1": "A sample of a radioactive element has a half-life of 10 days. If the initial mass of the sample was 80 grams, what will be the mass of the sample after 40 days? Use the concept of half-life calculations to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the half-life formula:\n\nFinal mass = Initial mass * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial mass is 80 grams, the half-life is 10 days, and the time elapsed is 40 days.\n\nFinal mass = 80 * (1/2)^(40 / 10)\n\nFinal mass = 80 * (1/2)^4\n\nFinal mass = 80 * (1/16)\n\nFinal mass = 5 grams\n\nSo, after 40 days, the mass of the radioactive sample will be 5 grams."
