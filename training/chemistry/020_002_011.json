    "message_1": "What are the equilibrium concentrations of SO2 and O2 if 2 moles of SO2 and 1 mole of O2 are allowed to reach equilibrium in a 2 L container at a temperature of 500 K, given that the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction SO2(g) + O2(g) ⇌ 2SO3(g) is 4.0?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) method.\n\n1. Write the balanced chemical equation:\nSO2(g) + O2(g) ⇌ 2SO3(g)\n\n2. Write the initial concentrations of each species:\n[SO2] = 2 moles / 2 L = 1 M\n[O2] = 1 mole / 2 L = 0.5 M\n[SO3] = 0 M (since none is initially present)\n\n3. Write the change in concentrations:\nLet x be the change in concentration of SO2 and O2.\nSO2: -x\nO2: -x\nSO3: +2x (since 2 moles of SO3 are produced for every mole of SO2 and O2 consumed)\n\n4. Write the equilibrium concentrations:\nSO2: 1 - x\nO2: 0.5 - x\nSO3: 2x\n\n5. Write the equilibrium expression (Kc):\nKc = [SO3]^2 / ([SO2] * [O2])\n4.0 = (2x)^2 / ((1 - x) * (0.5 - x))\n\n6. Solve for x:\n4.0 = 4x^2 / ((1 - x) * (0.5 - x))\nSolving this quadratic equation, we get x = 0.154 (ignoring the negative root as it doesn't make physical sense)\n\n7. Calculate the equilibrium concentrations:\n[SO2] = 1 - x = 1 - 0.154 = 0.846 M\n[O2] = 0.5 - x = 0.5 - 0.154 = 0.346 M\n[SO3] = 2x = 2 * 0.154 = 0.308 M\n\nSo, the equilibrium concentrations are:\n[SO2] = 0.846 M\n[O2] = 0.346 M\n[SO3] = 0.308 M"
