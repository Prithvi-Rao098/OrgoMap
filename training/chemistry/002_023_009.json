    "message_2": "The conductivity of inorganic compounds is directly related to the ionic concentration of the solution. In general, as the ionic concentration increases, the conductivity of the solution also increases. This is because the conductivity of a solution is dependent on the number of ions present, their mobility, and their charge.\n\nWhen an inorganic compound is dissolved in water, it dissociates into its constituent ions. These ions are responsible for carrying the electrical current through the solution. The more ions present in the solution, the greater the ability of the solution to conduct electricity.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that this relationship between ionic concentration and conductivity is not always linear. At very high concentrations, the conductivity may not increase proportionally with the increase in ionic concentration. This is due to the fact that at high concentrations, the ions are more likely to interact with each other, which can lead to a decrease in their mobility. This phenomenon is known as the \"concentration polarization\" effect.\n\nIn addition, the type of ions present in the solution can also affect the conductivity. For example, ions with higher charges (e.g., Ca2+ or Al3+) will have a greater impact on the conductivity than ions with lower charges (e.g., Na+ or Cl-). This is because ions with higher charges can carry more electrical current.\n\nIn summary, the effect of ionic concentration on the conductivity of inorganic compounds is generally positive, with conductivity increasing as ionic concentration increases. However, this relationship may not be linear at very high concentrations due to concentration polarization effects and the specific types of ions present in the solution."
