    "message_2": "During alpha decay, an unstable atom emits an alpha particle, which consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This process results in the parent atom losing 2 protons and 2 neutrons, which affects both its atomic number and mass number.\n\nThe atomic number (number of protons) decreases by 2, and the mass number (number of protons and neutrons) decreases by 4. This causes the atom to transform into a different element.\n\nFor example, let's consider uranium-238 (238U), which undergoes alpha decay. Uranium-238 has an atomic number of 92 (92 protons) and a mass number of 238 (92 protons + 146 neutrons).\n\nWhen uranium-238 undergoes alpha decay, it emits an alpha particle (2 protons + 2 neutrons) and transforms into thorium-234 (234Th). Thorium-234 has an atomic number of 90 (92 - 2 = 90 protons) and a mass number of 234 (238 - 4 = 234 protons + neutrons).\n\nThe alpha decay equation for this example is:\n\n238U → 234Th + α (alpha particle)\n\nIn summary, during alpha decay, an atom loses 2 protons and 2 neutrons, resulting in a decrease of its atomic number by 2 and mass number by 4, and transforming it into a different element."
