    "message_2": "To calculate the lattice energy of CaF₂, we can use the Born-Lande equation:\n\nLattice Energy = (N * A * (1 - 1/n) * q₁ * q₂) / (4πε₀ * r₀)\n\nWhere:\n- N is the Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10²³ mol⁻¹)\n- A is the Madelung constant (for CaF₂, A = 2.977)\n- n is the Born exponent (for CaF₂, n ≈ 10)\n- q₁ and q₂ are the charges on the ions (for Ca²⁺, q₁ = +2; for F⁻, q₂ = -1)\n- ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity (8.854 x 10⁻¹² C² / (N m²))\n- r₀ is the distance between the ions (2.40 Å, which is equal to 2.40 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)\n\nNow, let's plug in the values and calculate the lattice energy:\n\nLattice Energy = (6.022 x 10²³ * 2.977 * (1 - 1/10) * (+2) * (-1)) / (4π * 8.854 x 10⁻¹² * 2.40 x 10⁻¹⁰)\nLattice Energy = (6.022 x 10²³ * 2.977 * 0.9 * (-2)) / (4π * 8.854 x 10⁻¹² * 2.40 x 10⁻¹⁰)\n\nLattice Energy ≈ -2631 kJ/mol\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the lattice energy is released when the crystal lattice is formed. Therefore, the lattice energy of CaF₂ is approximately 2631 kJ/mol."
