    "message_2": "To prepare 4-bromoacetanilide from acetanilide and bromine, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Dissolve a known amount of acetanilide in a suitable solvent, such as glacial acetic acid. This solvent is chosen because it can dissolve both acetanilide and the bromine, and it can also act as a catalyst for the reaction.\n\n2. Slowly add a stoichiometric amount of bromine to the acetanilide solution while stirring. The bromine should be dissolved in the same solvent (glacial acetic acid) to facilitate mixing. The reaction between acetanilide and bromine is an electrophilic aromatic substitution, where bromine acts as the electrophile and replaces a hydrogen atom on the aromatic ring of acetanilide.\n\n3. The reaction mixture should be kept at a low temperature (0-5Â°C) during the addition of bromine to minimize side reactions and control the formation of the desired product. The reaction can be monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) to ensure the completion of the reaction.\n\n4. After the reaction is complete, the reaction mixture should be poured onto crushed ice to precipitate the product. The precipitate can be filtered and washed with cold water to remove any unreacted starting materials and byproducts.\n\n5. The crude product can be purified by recrystallization using a suitable solvent, such as ethanol or a mixture of ethanol and water. The purified product should be dried and characterized by melting point determination, infrared spectroscopy (IR), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to confirm its identity and purity.\n\nThe yield of the reaction depends on various factors, such as the purity of the starting materials, the efficiency of the reaction, and the effectiveness of the purification steps. In general, the yield for the preparation of 4-bromoacetanilide from acetanilide and bromine can range from 60-80%."
