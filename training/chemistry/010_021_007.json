    "message_2": "To calculate the corrosion potential of a zinc electrode in contact with a copper electrode in a 0.1 M solution of copper(II) sulfate at 25°C, we can use the Nernst equation. The Nernst equation is:\n\nE = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\n\nwhere E is the cell potential, E° is the standard cell potential, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin (25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K), n is the number of electrons transferred in the redox reaction, F is the Faraday constant (96485 C/mol), and Q is the reaction quotient.\n\nFirst, we need to write the half-reactions for the redox process:\n\nCu2+ + 2e- → Cu (E° = +0.34 V)\nZn → Zn2+ + 2e- (E° = -0.76 V)\n\nThe overall cell reaction is:\n\nCu2+ + Zn → Cu + Zn2+\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard cell potential (E°) by subtracting the standard reduction potential of the Zn2+/Zn half-cell from the Cu2+/Cu half-cell:\n\nE° = (+0.34 V) - (-0.76 V) = +1.10 V\n\nSince both half-reactions involve the transfer of 2 electrons (n = 2), we can now calculate the reaction quotient (Q) for the cell reaction:\n\nQ = [Zn2+]/[Cu2+]\n\nSince the zinc electrode is in contact with a 0.1 M solution of copper(II) sulfate, the concentration of Cu2+ ions is 0.1 M. Assuming that the concentration of Zn2+ ions is negligible, we can approximate Q as:\n\nQ ≈ 1/[Cu2+] = 1/0.1 = 10\n\nNow, we can plug all the values into the Nernst equation to calculate the cell potential (E):\n\nE = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)\nE = 1.10 V - (8.314 J/mol·K * 298.15 K / (2 * 96485 C/mol)) * ln(10)\nE ≈ 1.10 V - 0.0296 V = 1.0704 V\n\nTherefore, the corrosion potential of the zinc electrode in contact with a copper electrode in a 0.1 M solution of copper(II) sulfate at 25°C is approximately 1.0704 V."
