    "message_1": "What is the effect of increasing the temperature on the equilibrium constant (Kc) of the reaction below? \n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g)\n\nGiven that at 298K the equilibrium constant, Kc, for the reaction is 1.6 x 10^5, and the enthalpy change, ΔH°, for the reaction is -92.4 kJ/mol. If the temperature is increased by 50°C, what will be the new value of Kc?",
    "message_2": "To determine the effect of increasing the temperature on the equilibrium constant (Kc) of the reaction, we can use the van't Hoff equation:\n\nln(Kc2/Kc1) = -ΔH°/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere Kc1 is the initial equilibrium constant, Kc2 is the new equilibrium constant, ΔH° is the enthalpy change, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T1 is the initial temperature, and T2 is the final temperature.\n\nGiven values:\nKc1 = 1.6 x 10^5\nΔH° = -92.4 kJ/mol = -92400 J/mol\nT1 = 298 K\nT2 = 298 K + 50 K = 348 K\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the van't Hoff equation:\n\nln(Kc2/(1.6 x 10^5)) = -(-92400 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K) * (1/348 K - 1/298 K)\n\nSolving for Kc2:\n\nKc2 = (1.6 x 10^5) * exp((-92400 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K) * (1/348 K - 1/298 K))\n\nKc2 ≈ 1.04 x 10^4\n\nSo, the new value of Kc after increasing the temperature by 50°C is approximately 1.04 x 10^4. Since the reaction is exothermic (ΔH° < 0), increasing the temperature shifts the equilibrium towards the reactants, resulting in a lower equilibrium constant."
