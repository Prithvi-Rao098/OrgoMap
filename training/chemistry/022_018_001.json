    "message_2": "To calculate the bond energy of the C-C bond in ethane, we need to consider the balanced chemical equation for the combustion of ethane:\n\nC2H6 + 7/2 O2 → 2 CO2 + 3 H2O\n\nNow, let's break down the bonds in the reactants and products:\n\nReactants:\n1 C-C bond in ethane\n6 C-H bonds in ethane\n7 O=O bonds in oxygen molecules\n\nProducts:\n4 C=O bonds in carbon dioxide molecules\n6 O-H bonds in water molecules\n\nUsing the given bond energies, we can calculate the total energy change during the reaction:\n\nEnergy change = (Energy of bonds broken) - (Energy of bonds formed)\n\nEnergy of bonds broken:\n1 C-C bond (unknown energy, let's call it X)\n6 C-H bonds (6 × 413 kJ/mol)\n7 O=O bonds (7 × 498 kJ/mol, since the bond energy of O=O is 498 kJ/mol)\n\nEnergy of bonds formed:\n4 C=O bonds (4 × 799 kJ/mol, since the bond energy of C=O is 799 kJ/mol)\n6 O-H bonds (6 × 463 kJ/mol, since the bond energy of O-H is 463 kJ/mol)\n\nNow, let's plug in the values:\n\nEnergy change = (X + 6 × 413 + 7 × 498) - (4 × 799 + 6 × 463)\n-1,563 kJ/mol = (X + 2478 + 3493) - (3196 + 2778)\n\nSolving for X:\n\nX = -1,563 + 3196 + 2778 - 2478 - 3493\nX = 347 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the bond energy of the C-C bond in ethane is 347 kJ/mol."
