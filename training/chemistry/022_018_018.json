    "message_2": "Methane (CH4) does not have a C-C bond, as it consists of one carbon atom bonded to four hydrogen atoms. However, I can provide you with the bond energy required to break a C-H bond in methane.\n\nThe bond energy required to break a C-H bond in methane is approximately 414 kJ/mol."
